6,Electromyographic analysis of the masseter and temporal muscles in oralized deaf individuals.,"Deaf individuals show a number of difficulties related to the functionality of the stomatognathic system, mainly by reason of the little or no use of facial musculature during speech either due to the use of sign language or to the difficulty that these individuals have in articulating words. The stomatognathic system muscles play important roles in functions such as mastication, deglutition, and phonation. This study aimed to assess, by means of computerized bilateral electromyography (EMG), masseter and temporal muscles of 12 oralized deaf individuals in clinical activities that involve part of this masticatory musculature and compare this system's functionality with that of 12 normal listening individuals, performing the same activities. An 8-channel K6-I EMG Light Channel Surface Electromyography device was used (Myo-Tronics Co.Seattle, WA, USA), in addition to disposable double electrodes covered with silver chloride (Duotrodes; Myo-tronics Co., Seattle, WA) containing a conductor gel (Myogel- Myo-tronics Co., Seatlle, WA). The averaged rectified EMG values were normalized with reference to the EMG amplitude induced by a maximum bite force. The statistical analysis confirmed that there were any significant differences between the groups, clinical activities, and muscles, and also effects of interaction among them. The analysis made use of Variance Analysis (ANOVA). Significant differences (p < 0.01) for both muscles were found among the clinical conditions, with deaf individuals showing greater electromyographic activity for both muscles for the clinical activity protrusion. Deaf individuals showed a lower muscular activity for clinical activities that demanded a greater masseter and temporal muscular activity such as mastication, mouth opening and closing, and dental compression. Greater electromyographic values were found for both deaf individuals and healthy controls during clinical activities of mastication and dental compression. Based on the obtained data, we concluded that deaf individuals showed a lower activity of the masticatory musculature than healthy individuals; the differences were significant at the level of p < 0.01 between the performed clinical activities; and all deaf individuals and healthy controls showed greater electromyographic values for mastication and dental compression.",,
6,Avoidable emergency department visits: a starting point.,"To better characterize and understand the nature of a very conservative definition of 'avoidable' emergency department (ED) visits in the United States to provide policymakers insight into what interventions can target non-urgent ED visits.We performed a retrospective analysis of a very conservative definition of 'avoidable' ED visits using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2005 to 2011.We examined a total of 115 081 records, representing 424 million ED visits made by patients aged 18-64 years who were seen in the ED and discharged home.We defined 'avoidable' as ED visits that did not require any diagnostic or screening services, procedures or medications, and were discharged home.In total, 3.3% (95% CI: 3.0-3.7) of all ED visits were 'avoidable.' The top five chief complaints included toothache, back pain, headache, other symptoms/problems related to psychosis and throat soreness. Alcohol abuse, dental disorders and depressive disorders were among the top three ICD-9 discharge diagnoses. Alcohol-related disorders and mood disorders accounted for 6.8% (95% CI: 5.7-8.0) of avoidable visits, and dental disorders accounted for 3.9% (95% CI: 3.0-4.8) of CCS-grouped discharge diagnoses.A significant number of 'avoidable' ED visits were for mental health and dental conditions, which the ED is not fully equipped to treat. Our findings provide a better understanding of what policy initiatives could potentially reduce these 'avoidable' ED visits to address the gaps in our healthcare system, such as increased access to mental health and dental care.",,
6,Objective identification of dental abnormalities with multispectral fluorescence imaging.,"Sensitive methods that can enable early detection of dental diseases (caries and calculus) are desirable in clinical practice. Optical spectroscopic approaches have emerged as promising alternatives owing to their wealth of molecular information and lack of sample preparation requirements. In the present study, using multispectral fluorescence imaging, we have demonstrated that dental caries and calculus can be objectively identified on extracted tooth. Spectral differences among control, carious and calculus conditions were attributed to the porphyrin pigment content, which is a byproduct of bacterial metabolism. Spectral maps generated using different porphyrin bands offer important clues to the spread of bacterial infection. Statistically significant differences utilizing fluorescence intensity ratios were observed among three groups. In contrast to laser induced fluorescence, these methods can provide information about exact spread of the infection and may aid in long term dental monitoring. Successful adoption of this approach for routine clinical usage can assist dentists in implementing timely remedial measures.",,
6,The effects of oral health on systemic health.,"The oral cavity is the intersection of medicine and dentistry and the window into the general health of a patient. Hundreds of diseases and medications impact the oral cavity, and pathologic conditions in the mouth have a greater systemic impact than many providers appreciate. It is unclear whether there is true causality or just an association between periodontal disease and certain other systemic conditions, including atherosclerotic vascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, pregnancy-related complications, osteoporosis, and kidney disease. Diabetes has a true bidirectional relationship with periodontal disease, and there is strong evidence that treating one condition positively impacts the other. A shared trait of periodontal disease and these medical conditions is that they are chronic conditions that take a long time to develop and become clinically significant. Primary prevention-treating the patient prior to the onset of symptoms, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetic complications, or significant periodontal disease-is the challenge. Complications associated with these conditions cause significant morbidity and mortality and are incredibly costly to the healthcare system. Unfortunately, a lack of access to primary medical or dental care prevents some patients from engaging the system until a negative event has occurred. Despite the absence of clear evidence of causality and the direct impact of treatments, the consequences of these chronic conditions for the population are well understood. Dentists, family physicians, and all primary care providers must increase their collaboration and communication to maximize the benefit to patients.",,
6,Use of light-cured resin to manufacture occlusal splints: report of two cases.,"This article presents selected cases of patients with functional disorders of the stomatognathic system. This group of patients had a need to made different types of removable occlusal splints. In the past, occlusal appliances were made mostly using self-cured acrylate materials, which for many years had no replacements. The rapid development of dental materials technology led to creation of thermo-formable materials and resins, which can successfully replace traditional acrylic materials in daily clinical practice. A practical application of light-cured resin in the fabrication of the occlusal splints in two clinical cases is reported and discussed herein.",,
6,Behavioral problems and emotional stress in children with bruxism.,"Bruxism has a multifactorial etiology, and psychosocial factors have been considered to increase the risk of occurrence of this parafunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavior profile of a group of children diagnosed with bruxism. Eighty 7-11-year-old children of both genders (mean age 8.8 years) first recruited as eligible participants. Twenty-nine children (18 males and 11 females) whose parents/guardians reported to present frequent episodes of tooth grinding/clenching while awake or during sleep (at least 3 nights a week) in the previous 3 months were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of bruxism was established based on the parents/guardians' report about the children's behavior, habits and possible discomforts in the components of the stomatognathic system allied to the presence of signs and symptoms such as pain on the masticatory muscles, masseter muscle hypertrophy, wear facets, fractures of restorations, dental impressions on the cheek mucosa and tongue. As part of the psychological evaluation, the Rutter's Child Behavior Scale-A2 was applied to the parents/caregivers (one for each child) and the Child Stress Scale was applied to the children. Data were analyzed descriptively based on the frequency of each studied variable. Twenty-four (82.76%) children needed psychological or psychiatric intervention; 17 of them presented neurotic disorders and 7 children presented antisocial disorders. Six (20.70%) children presented significant physical and psychological manifestations of stress. The findings of the present study suggest that behavioral problems and potential emotional problems can be risk factors to bruxism in children.",,
6,Clinical signs of temporomandibular disorders and various pain conditions among children 6 to 8 years of age: the PANIC study.,"To examine the prevalence and significance of clinically determined signs of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and pain in different parts of the body as well as the frequency, intensity, and other features of pain in children.The subjects were a population-based sample of children 6 to 8 years of age. Complete data on clinical signs of TMD were available for 483 children. Data on pain during the past 3 months, assessed by a questionnaire administered by parents, were available for 424 children. Differences between the prevalence of at least one sign of TMD and the location or frequency of pain were evaluated using the chi-square test, as well as the associations between the prevalence, frequency, and location of pain and gender, the use of medication, and visits to a physician. The relationship of various pain conditions with the risk of having clinical signs of TMD was analyzed using logistic regression.Of the 483 children, 171 (35%) had at least one clinical sign of TMD. Of the 424 children, 226 (53%) had experienced pain during the past 3 months. Pain was most prevalent in the lower limbs (35%) and head (32%). Of the 226 children with pain, 119 (53%) had experienced frequent pain (??? once a week). No gender differences were found. The risk of having at least one clinical sign of TMD was 3.0 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.1-8.5, P < .05) times higher in children with back pain, 2.7 (95% CI: 1.2-6.0, P < .05) times higher in children with neck-shoulder pain, and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.5, P < .05) times higher in children with headache compared to children without these pain symptoms. The risk of having at least one clinical sign of TMD was 12.2 (95% CI: 1.4-101.8, P < .01) times higher among children with palpation tenderness in trapezius muscles than among those without it.Clinical signs of TMD and pain symptoms are common in children. The relationship of back pain, neck-shoulder muscle palpation tenderness, and headache with clinical signs of TMD suggests that more attention should be paid to stomatognathic function in children with such pain problems.",,
6,Changes in masticatory muscles activity associated with Eagle's syndrome.,"This study had the goal of analyzing masseter and temporalis muscles of individuals with Eagle's Syndrome, establishing comparisons with healthy control individuals by means of electromyography, due to the importance of the masticatory musculature upon the various functions of the stomatognathic system and the effects of Eagle's syndrome on this system's functioning.Ten women with Eagle's syndrome and ten healthy controls volunteered to participate in the study. A Myosystem I system, Prosecon Ltda (Uberl??ndia/MG, Brazil) with 12 channels was used Active differential electrodes were placed on the belly of both masseters and on the anterior temporalis. Firstly, rest position was registered and then the patients were instructed to clench their teeth with maximum strength for four seconds to register the Clenching at Usual Maximum Intercuspation. Next, the clinical conditions of chewing, mandible laterality, and water swallowing were performed.The normalized data of muscle activity during the different clinical conditions and at rest position were compared by Student's t test, considering two groups: controls and syndrome bearers. The masticatory muscles of every syndrome bearers showed hyperactivity during the analyzed clinical conditions; except for chewing, in which the right masseter did not show greater electromyographic activity.It is concluded that individuals with the syndrome showed muscular hyperactivity when compared to healthy individuals, due to the interference of the elongated styloid process, which leads to dysfunctions of the stomatognathic system in the syndrome bearers, with signs and symptoms related to craniofacial pain, dysphagia, otalgy, temporomandibular dysfunctions, and headache.",,
6,Oral surgery II: Part 2. The maxillary sinus (antrum) and oral surgery.,"The maxillary sinus is the largest of the four paranasal sinuses and, being anatomically adjacent to the dentate region of the maxilla, is commonly a source of problems - not simply in terms of conditions affecting the sinus but also in establishing an accurate diagnosis. As anyone who has suffered both sinusitis and a dental abscess in the posterior maxilla will tell you, the symptoms are almost indistinguishable. For this reason, a sound understanding of the maxillary sinus is an essential requisite for all dentists.",,
6,American Academy of Periodontology Best Evidence Consensus Statement on Selected Oral Applications for Cone-Beam Computed Tomography.,"The American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) recently embarked on a Best Evidence Consensus (BEC) model of scientific inquiry to address questions of clinical importance in periodontology for which there is insufficient evidence to arrive at a definitive conclusion. This review addresses oral indications for use of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).To develop the BEC, the AAP convened a panel of experts with knowledge of CBCT and substantial experience in applying CBCT to a broad range of clinical scenarios that involve critical structures in the oral cavity. The panel examined a clinical scenario or treatment decision that would likely benefit from additional evidence and interpretation of evidence, performed a systematic review on the individual, debated the merits of published data and experiential information, developed a consensus report, and provided a clinical bottom line based on the best evidence available.This BEC addressed the potential value and limitations of CBCT relative to specific applications in the management of patients requiring or being considered for the following clinical therapies: 1) placement of dental implants; 2) interdisciplinary dentofacial therapy involving orthodontic tooth movement in the management of malocclusion with associated risk on the supporting periodontal tissues (namely, dentoalveolar bone); and 3) management of periodontitis.For each specific question addressed, there is a critical mass of evidence, but insufficient evidence to support broad conclusions or definitive clinical practice guidelines.",,
6,Comparison of intubation and tracheotomy in patients with deep neck infection.,"Possible airway compromise further complicates treatment of deep neck infections (DNI). Airway management is crucial, but factors affecting the method of choice are unclear. We retrospectively evaluated adult DNIs in a single tertiary center covering 10??years, with special attention on airway management. Patient data were retrieved from electronic data files from 2007 to 2016, and included adult patients with DNI operated through the neck. Of the 202 patients, 127 (63%) were male, with a median age of 47??years. Odontogenic (n??=??74; 35%) infection was the most common etiology. Intubation was the most common method of airway management (n??=??165; 82%), and most patients (n??=??102; 50%) were extubated immediately after surgery. Tracheotomy was performed primarily for 35 (17%) patients, and secondarily for 25 (15%). Two patients were managed in local anesthesia. Altogether 80 (40%) patients required care in the intensive care unit for a median of 7??days. Median hospital stay was 6??days for intubated patients and 10??days for primarily tracheotomized (p??=??0.036). DNI extended to the mediastinal space in 25 (12%) patients, most of whom with odontogenic infection (48%), and necrotizing fasciitis (32%). Odontogenic infection was the most common etiology for DNI with increased risk for mediastinal involvement. Intubation was most common type of airway management with high success in immediate extubation after surgery. The need for tracheotomy seemed to lead to a longer hospital care and was associated with a more severe clinical course.",,
6,"Oral-health-related quality of life of dental patients: a hospital based study in far north Queensland, Australia.","To investigate the prevalence, extent, and severity of oral-health-related quality of life among dental patients in far north Queensland, Australia.A questionnaire was designed consisting of two parts: socio-demographic questions and the short form of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) in part 1 and 2 respectively. The survey was conducted from July to August 2014 among patients attending the James Cook University Dental Clinic.Five hundred and nineteen questionnaires were distributed and collected. Of these, 40 were excluded from the analysis due to being incomplete. Therefore, a total of 479 questionnaires were available for the analysis. Half the respondents (50.9%) reported one or more of the 14 impacts as ""fairly often"" or ""very often."" The individual OHIP items with the highest prevalence recorded were physical pain and psychological discomfort. Females (52.2%) experienced a slightly higher prevalence compared to males (49.3%) but this difference was not statistically significant (Chi-square test: P??>??0.05). Participants who identified as Indigenous Australian or Torres Strait Islanders and those in the 36-50 age group recorded the highest prevalence (Kruskal-Wallis test: P??<??0.05). Indigenous Australians and Torres Strait Islanders also reported the highest mean extent score (4.39) and mean severity score (23.19).This study revealed comparatively higher prevalence, extent, and severity scores reflecting a significantly poor oral-health-related quality of life among dental patients living in far north Queensland, Australia.",,
2,Transferrin-mediated iron sequestration as a novel therapy for bacterial and fungal infections.,"Pathogenic microbes must acquire essential nutrients, including iron, from the host in order to proliferate and cause infections. Iron sequestration is an ancient host antimicrobial strategy. Thus, enhancing iron sequestration is a promising, novel anti-infective strategy. Unfortunately, small molecule iron chelators have proven difficult to develop as anti-infective treatments, in part due to unacceptable toxicities. Iron sequestration in mammals is predominantly mediated by the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins. In this review, we explore the possibility of administering supraphysiological levels of exogenous transferrin as an iron sequestering therapy for infections, which could overcome some of the problems associated with small molecule chelation. Recent studies suggest that transferrin delivery may represent a promising approach to augment both natural resistance and traditional antibiotic therapy. ",,
2,Severe infections in critically ill solid organ transplant recipients.,"Severe infections are among the most common causes of death in immunocompromised patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of these infections has evolved in the last decade.We aim to provide a comprehensive review of these severe infections in this population.Review of the literature pertaining to severe infections in critically ill solid organ transplant recipients. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for documents published since database inception until November 2017.The epidemiology of severe infections has changed in the immunocompromised patients. This population is presenting to the intensive care unit with specific transplantation procedure-related infections, device-associated infections, a multitude of opportunistic viral infections, an increasing number of nosocomial infections and bacterial diseases with a more limited therapeutic armamentarium. Both molecular diagnostics and imaging techniques have had substantial progress in the last decade, which will, we hope, translate into faster and more precise diagnoses, as well as more optimal empirical treatment de-escalation.The key clinical elements to improve the outcome of critically ill solid organ transplant recipients depend on the knowledge of geographic epidemiology, specific surgical procedures, net state of immunosuppression, hospital microbial ecology, aggressive diagnostic strategy and search for source control, rapid initiation of antimicrobials and minimization of iatrogenic immunosuppression.",,
2,Sirtuin 3 deficiency does not alter host defenses against bacterial and fungal infections.,"Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is the main mitochondrial deacetylase. SIRT3 regulates cell metabolism and redox homeostasis, and protects from aging and age-associated pathologies. SIRT3 may drive both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects. SIRT3 deficiency has been reported to promote chronic inflammation-related disorders, but whether SIRT3 impacts on innate immune responses and host defenses against infections remains essentially unknown. This aspect is of primary importance considering the great interest in developing SIRT3-targeted therapies. Using SIRT3 knockout mice, we show that SIRT3 deficiency does not affect immune cell development and microbial ligand-induced proliferation and cytokine production by splenocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Going well along with these observations, SIRT3 deficiency has no major impact on cytokine production, bacterial burden and survival of mice subjected to endotoxemia, Escherichia coli peritonitis, Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, listeriosis and candidiasis of diverse severity. These data suggest that SIRT3 is not critical to fight infections and support the safety of SIRT3-directed therapies based on SIRT3 activators or inhibitors for treating metabolic, oncologic and neurodegenerative diseases without putting patients at risk of infection.",,
2,Emerging novel and antimicrobial-resistant respiratory tract infections: new drug development and therapeutic options.,"The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens for which diminishing treatment options are available is of major global concern. New viral respiratory tract infections with epidemic potential, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, swine-origin influenza A H1N1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, require development of new antiviral agents. The substantial rise in the global numbers of patients with respiratory tract infections caused by pan-antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and multiazole-resistant fungi has focused attention on investments into development of new drugs and treatment regimens. Successful treatment outcomes for patients with respiratory tract infections across all health-care settings will necessitate rapid, precise diagnosis and more effective and pathogen-specific therapies. This Series paper describes the development and use of new antimicrobial agents and immune-based and host-directed therapies for a range of conventional and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal causes of respiratory tract infections.
