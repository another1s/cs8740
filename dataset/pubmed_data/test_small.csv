0,Gut microbiota in toxicological risk assessment of drugs and chemicals: The need of hour.,"The advent of industrial revolution caused a large inflow of synthetic chemicals for medical, agricultural, industrial and other purposes in the world. In general, these chemicals were subjected to toxicological risk assessment for human health and ecology before release for public use. But today we are witnessing a negative impact of some of these chemicals on human health and environment indicating an underestimation of toxic effects by current risk assessment protocol. Recent studies established gut microbiota as one of the key player in intercession of toxicity of drugs and synthetic chemicals. Hence, the need of the hour is to include the assessment for microbiota specifically gut microbiota in human toxicological risk assessment protocol. Herewith we are proposing a framework for assessment of gut microbiota upon exposure to drugs or chemicals.","['drugs', 'environmental chemicals', 'gut microbiota', 'risk assessment', 'toxicology']",['Ganesan Velmurugan']
0,"Pharmaceutical chemicals, steroids and xenoestrogens in water, sediments and fish from the tidal freshwater Potomac River (Virginia, USA).","Selected pharmaceutical chemicals, steroids and xenoestrogens (PCSXs) consisting of 29 endocrine modulators, therapeutic drugs, pesticides, detergents, plastics, and active ingredients in household products were measured in water, riverbed sediments and fish collected in a tributary embayment of the Potomac River (Hunting Creek, Alexandria, VA, USA) in the vicinity of wastewater discharge. A total of 17 PCSXs were found in the Hunting Creek samples, with steroid hormones (e.g., progesterone and 17??-ethinylestradiol), triclosan, dextromethorphan and bisphenol A being the most prominent micropollutants detected.The geospatial distribution of the PCSXs in Hunting Creek indicated that the steroids correlated with wastewater treatment plant discharge in all matrices, but such an association is tentative in Hunting Creek given the complex nature of urban sources of PCSXs and hydrodynamics in an urban tidal river. The sediment PCSX concentrations correlated with sediment total organic carbon content at all sampling sites. For the most part, the PCSXs showed an enrichment in fish tissue relative to sediments when concentrations were normalized to lipids and sediment organic carbon contents, but the influence of endogenous steroids is also an important consideration for these chemicals.","['Fish', 'pharmaceutical chemicals', 'riverbed sediments', 'steroids', 'surface water', 'xenoestrogens']","['Golala Arya', 'Sara Tadayon', 'James Sadighian', 'Jennifer Jones', 'Kim de Mutsert', 'Thomas B Huff', 'Gregory D Foster']"
0,Spectrophotometric studies of reactions between pseudo-ephedrine with different inorganic and organic reagents and its micro-determination in pure and in pharmaceutical preparations.,"Two simple, sensitive, cheep and reliable spectrophotometric methods are suggested for micro-determination of pseudoephedrine in its pure form and in pharmaceutical preparation (Sinofree Tablets). The first one depends on the drug reaction with inorganic sensitive reagent like molybdate anion in aqueous media via formation of ion-pair mechanism. The second one depends on the drug reaction with ?€-acceptor reagent like DDQ in non-aqueous media via formation of charge transfer complex. These reactions were studied under various conditions and the optimum parameters were selected. Under proper conditions the suggested procedures were successfully applied for micro-determination of pseudoephedrine in pure and in Sinofree Tablets without interference from excepients. The values of SD, RSD, recovery %, LOD, LOQ and Sandell sensitivity refer to the high accuracy and precession of the applied procedures. The results obtained were compared with the data obtained by an official method, referring to confidence and agreement with DDQ procedure results; but it referred to the more accuracy of the molybdate data. Therefore, the suggested procedures are now successfully being applied in routine analysis of this drug in its pharmaceutical formulation (Sinofree) in Saudi Arabian Pharmaceutical Company (SPIMACO) in Boridah El-Qaseem, Saudi Arabia instead of imported kits had been previously used.",[],"['M A Zayed', 'El-Gazy A El-Rasheedy']"
0,Plant uptake of pharmaceutical chemicals detected in recycled organic manure and reclaimed wastewater.,"Land application of recycled manure produced from biosolids and reclaimed wastewater can transfer pharmaceutical chemicals to terrestrial environments, giving rise to potential accumulation of these residues in edible plants. In this study, the potential for plant uptake of 13 pharmaceutical chemicals, and the relation between the accumulation features within the plant and the physicochemical properties were examined by exposing pea and cucumber to an aqueous solution containing pharmaceutical chemicals. Ten of 13 compounds tested were detected in plant leaves and stems. Comparison of the plant uptake characteristics and the octanol-water partition coefficient of pharmaceutical chemicals showed that compounds with an intermediate polarity such as carbamazepine and crotamiton could be easily transported to plant shoots. Moreover, these results suggest the possibility of highly hydrophilic pharmaceutical chemicals such as trimethoprim and sulfonamides to be accumulated in plant roots owing to their low permeability in root cell membranes.",[],"['Rumi Tanoue', 'Yuri Sato', 'Miki Motoyama', 'Shuhei Nakagawa', 'Ryota Shinohara', 'Kei Nomiyama']"
0,Generic gas chromatography-flame ionization detection method for quantitation of volatile amines in pharmaceutical drugs and synthetic intermediates.,"Volatile amines are among the most frequently used chemicals in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. Synthetic route optimization often involves the evaluation of several different amines requiring the development and validation of analytical methods for quantitation of residual amine levels. Herein, a simple and fast generic GC-FID method on an Agilent J&W CP-Volamine capillary column (using either He or H<sub>2</sub> as the carrier gas) capable of separating over 25 volatile amines and other basic polar species commonly used in pharmaceutical chemistry workflows is described. This 16min method is successfully applied to the analysis and quantitation of volatile amines in a variety of pharmaceutically-related drugs and synthetic intermediates. Method validation experiments showed excellent analytical performance in linearity, recovery, repeatability, and limit of quantitation and detection. In addition, diverse examples for the application of this method to the simultaneous determination of other amine-related chemicals in reaction mixtures are illustrated, thereby indicating that these GC-FID method conditions can be effectively used as starting point during method development for the analysis of other basic polar species beyond the validated list of amines described in this study.","['Basic compounds', 'Capillary column', 'Gas chromatography-flame ionization detector', 'Method development', 'Pharmaceutical analysis', 'Volatile amines']","['Gabriel C Graffius', 'Brandon M Jocher', 'Daniel Zewge', 'Holst M Halsey', 'Gary Lee', 'Frank Bernardoni', 'Xiaodong Bu', 'Robert Hartman', 'Erik L Regalado']"
0,Predicting binding affinities of diverse pharmaceutical chemicals to human serum plasma proteins using QSPR modelling approaches.,"The prediction of the plasma protein binding (PPB) affinity of chemicals is of paramount significance in the drug development process. In this study, ensemble machine learning-based QSPR models have been established for a four-category classification and PPB affinity prediction of diverse compounds using a large PPB dataset of 930 compounds and in accordance with the OECD guidelines. The structural diversity of the chemicals was tested by the Tanimoto similarity index. The external predictive power of the developed QSPR models was evaluated through internal and external validations. In the QSPR models, XLogP was the most important descriptor. In the test data, the classification QSPR models rendered an accuracy of >93%, while the regression QSPR models yielded r(2) of >0.920 between the measured and predicted PPB affinities, with the root mean squared error <9.77. Values of statistical coefficients derived for the test data were above their threshold limits, thus put a high confidence in this analysis. The QSPR models in this study performed better than any of the previous studies. The results suggest that the developed QSPR models are reliable for predicting the PPB affinity of structurally diverse chemicals. They can be useful for initial screening of candidate molecules in the drug development process.

0,Evolution of camel CYP2E1 and its associated power of binding toxic industrial chemicals and drugs.,"Camels are raised in harsh desert environment for hundreds of years ago. By modernization of live and the growing industrial revolution in camels rearing areas, camels are exposed to considerable amount of chemicals, industrial waste, environmental pollutions and drugs. Furthermore, camels have unique gene evolution of some genes to withstand living in harsh environments. In this work, the camel cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is compromised to detect its evolution rate and its power to bind with various chemicals, protoxins, procarcinogens, industrial toxins and drugs. In comparison with human CYP2E1, camel CYP2E1 more efficiently binds to small toxins as aniline, benzene, catechol, amides, butadiene, toluene and acrylamide. Larger compounds were more preferentially bound to the human CYP2E1 in comparison with camel CYP2E1. The binding of inhalant anesthetics was almost similar in both camel and human CYP2E1 coinciding with similar anesthetic effect as well as toxicity profiles. Furthermore, evolutionary analysis indicated the high evolution rate of camel CYP2E1 in comparison with human, farm and companion animals. The evolution rate of camel CYP2E1 was among the highest evolution rate in a subset of 57 different organisms. These results indicate rapid evolution and potent toxin binding power of camel CYP2E1.","['Binding', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Docking', 'Evolution rate', 'Molecular modeling']","['Mahmoud Kandeel', 'Abdullah Altaher', 'Yukio Kitade', 'Magdi Abdelaziz', 'Mohamed Alnazawi', 'Kamal Elshazli']"
0,An integrated biorefinery concept for conversion of sugar beet pulp into value-added chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates.,"Over 8 million tonnes of sugar beet are grown annually in the UK. Sugar beet pulp (SBP) is the main by-product of sugar beet processing which is currently dried and sold as a low value animal feed. SBP is a rich source of carbohydrates, mainly in the form of cellulose and pectin, including d-glucose (Glu), l-arabinose (Ara) and d-galacturonic acid (GalAc). This work describes the technical feasibility of an integrated biorefinery concept for the fractionation of SBP and conversion of these monosaccharides into value-added products. SBP fractionation is initially carried out by steam explosion under mild conditions to yield soluble pectin and insoluble cellulose fractions. The cellulose is readily hydrolysed by cellulases to release Glu that can then be fermented by a commercial yeast strain to produce bioethanol at a high yield. The pectin fraction can be either fully hydrolysed, using physico-chemical methods, or selectively hydrolysed, using cloned arabinases and galacturonases, to yield Ara-rich and GalAc-rich streams. These monomers can be separated using either Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC) or ultrafiltration into streams suitable for subsequent enzymatic upgrading. Building on our previous experience with transketolase (TK) and transaminase (TAm) enzymes, the conversion of Ara and GalAc into higher value products was explored. In particular the conversion of Ara into l-gluco-heptulose (GluHep), that has potential therapeutic applications in hypoglycaemia and cancer, using a mutant TK is described. Preliminary studies with TAm also suggest GluHep can be selectively aminated to the corresponding chiral aminopolyol. The current work is addressing the upgrading of the remaining SBP monomer, GalAc, and the modelling of the biorefinery concept to enable economic and Life Cycle Analysis (LCA).",[],"['Max C??rdenas-Fern??ndez', 'Maria Bawn', 'Charlotte Hamley-Bennett', 'Penumathsa K V Bharat', 'Fabiana Subrizi', 'Nurashikin Suhaili', 'David P Ward', 'Sarah Bourdin', 'Paul A Dalby', 'Helen C Hailes', 'Peter Hewitson', 'Svetlana Ignatova', 'Cleo Kontoravdi', 'David J Leak', 'Nilay Shah', 'Tom D Sheppard', 'John M Ward', 'Gary J Lye']"
0,"Transformation of endocrine disrupting chemicals, pharmaceutical and personal care products during drinking water disinfection.","Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are frequently detected in drinking water sources. This raises concerns about the formation of potentially more toxic transformation products (TPs) after drinking water disinfection. This study applied a combination of computational and experimental methods to investigate the biological activity of eight EDCs and PPCPs commonly detected in source waters (acetaminophen, bisphenol A, carbamazepine, estrone, 17??-ethinylestradiol, gemfibrozil, naproxen and triclosan) before and after disinfection. Using a Stepped Forced Molecular Dynamics (SFMD) method, we detected 911 unique TPs, 36% of which have been previously reported in the scientific literature. We calculated the likelihood that TPs would cause damage to biomolecules or DNA relative to the parent compound based on lipophilicity and the occurrence of structural alerts, and applied two Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) tools to predict toxicity via receptor-mediated effects. In parallel, batch experiments were performed with three disinfectants, chlorine, chlorine dioxide and chloramine. After solid-phase extraction, the resulting TP mixtures were analyzed by chemical analysis and a battery of eleven in vitro bioassays covering a variety of endpoints. The laboratory results were in good agreement with the predictions. Overall, the combination of computational and experimental chemistry and toxicity methods used in this study suggest that disinfection of the studied EDCs and PPCPs will produce a large number of TPs, which are unlikely to increase specific toxicity (e.g., endocrine activity), but may result in increased reactive and non-specific toxicity.","['Computational chemistry', 'Disinfection', 'High resolution mass spectrometry', 'Micropollutant', 'Predictive toxicology', 'Transformation product']","['Frederic D L Leusch', 'Peta A Neale', 'Francesco Busetti', 'Marcella Card', 'Andrew Humpage', 'John D Orbell', 'Harry F Ridgway', 'Matthew B Stewart', 'Jason P van de Merwe', 'Beate I Escher']"

0,Inferring anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) class of drugs using shortest path and random walk with restart algorithms.,"The anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system is a widely accepted drug classification scheme. This system comprises five levels and includes several classes in each level. Drugs are classified into classes according to their therapeutic effects and characteristics. The first level includes 14 main classes. In this study, we proposed two network-based models to infer novel potential chemicals deemed to belong in the first level of ATC classification. To build these models, two large chemical networks were constructed using the chemical-chemical interaction information retrieved from the Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH). Two classic network algorithms, shortest path (SP) and random walk with restart (RWR) algorithms, were executed on the corresponding network to mine novel chemicals for each ATC class using the validated drugs in a class as seed nodes. Then, the obtained chemicals yielded by these two algorithms were further evaluated by a permutation test and an association test. The former can exclude chemicals produced by the structure of the network, i.e., false positive discoveries. By contrast, the latter identifies the most important chemicals that have strong associations with the ATC class. Comparisons indicated that the two models can provide quite dissimilar results, suggesting that the results yielded by one model can be essential supplements for those obtained by the other model. In addition, several representative inferred chemicals were analyzed to confirm the reliability of the results generated by the two models.

0,Membrane Bioreactors for Pharmaceutical Applications: Optically Pure Enantiomers Production.,"In biological systems, recognition at molecular level is governed by chiral interactions. Therefore, optical isomers have very different effect in natural systems. For example, one can have beneficial effect while the other can be very harmful. For these reasons, chiral drugs nowadays are mainly admitted in the optically pure form. Given these requirements, it is clear why demand for chiral drugs has grown dramatically and the singleenantiomer drug segment has become an important part of the overall pharmaceutical market. As a consequence, the development of new chiral separation techniques is a very hot topic in both academic research and industrial innovation. Membrane bioreactors have proven their feasibility in the production of optically pure enantiomers by combining enantiospecific biochemical reactions with mass transport through membranes. The principles and the applications of enantioselective membrane bioreactors in kinetic resolution for pharmaceutical applications will be discussed. Various membrane bioreactors configurations and operation mode will be illustrated. The type of enzymes utilized to produce chiral drugs or their intermediates will be also reported. Multistep syntheses, conducted in sequential reactions catalysed by spatially aligned biocatalysts, as promising technology for the synthesis of fine chemicals will be highlighted.","['Membrane bioreactor', 'chiral drugs', 'enantioselectivity', 'enzyme', 'kinetic resolution', 'mass transport in\nmembranes', 'optically pure enantiomer', 'two-separate phase membrane contactor']","['Emma Piacentini', 'Rosalinda Mazzei', 'Lidietta Giorno']"
0,A rational approach to selecting and ranking some pharmaceuticals of concern for the aquatic environment and their relative importance compared with other chemicals.,"Aquatic organisms can be exposed to thousands of chemicals discharged by the human population. Many of these chemicals are considered disruptive to aquatic wildlife, and the literature on the impacts of these chemicals grows daily. However, because time and resources are not infinite, research must focus on the chemicals that represent the greatest threat. One group of chemicals of increasing concern is pharmaceuticals, for which the primary challenge is to identify which represent the greatest threat. In the present study, a list of 12 pharmaceuticals was compiled based on scoring the prevalence of different compounds from previous prioritization reviews. These included rankings based on prescription data, environmental concentrations, predicted environmental concentration/predicted no-effect concentration (PEC/PNEC) ratios, persistency/bioaccumulation/(eco)toxicity (PBT), and fish plasma model approaches. The most frequently cited were diclofenac, paracetamol, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, naproxen, atenolol, ethinyl estradiol, aspirin, fluoxetine, propranolol, metoprolol, and sulfamethoxazole. For each pharmaceutical, literature on effect concentrations was compiled and compared with river concentrations in the United Kingdom. The pharmaceuticals were ranked by degree of difference between the median effect and median river concentrations. Ethinyl estradiol was ranked as the highest concern, followed by fluoxetine, propranolol, and paracetamol. The relative risk of these pharmaceuticals was compared with those of metals and some persistent organic pollutants. Pharmaceuticals appear to be less of a threat to aquatic organisms than some metals (Cu, Al, Zn) and triclosan, using this ranking approach.","['Chemicals', 'Environment', 'Identification', 'Pharmaceuticals', 'Risk']","['Rachel L Donnachie', 'Andrew C Johnson', 'John P Sumpter']"
0,"T-cell recognition of chemicals, protein allergens and drugs: towards the development of in vitro assays.","Chemicals can elicit T-cell-mediated diseases such as allergic contact dermatitis and adverse drug reactions. Therefore, testing of chemicals, drugs and protein allergens for hazard identification and risk assessment is essential in regulatory toxicology. The seventh amendment of the EU Cosmetics Directive now prohibits the testing of cosmetic ingredients in mice, guinea pigs and other animal species to assess their sensitizing potential. In addition, the EU Chemicals Directive REACh requires the retesting of more than 30,000 chemicals for different toxicological endpoints, including sensitization, requiring vast numbers of animals. Therefore, alternative methods are urgently needed to eventually replace animal testing. Here, we summarize the outcome of an expert meeting in Rome on 7 November 2009 on the development of T-cell-based in vitro assays as tools in immunotoxicology to identify hazardous chemicals and drugs.

0,Grouping 34 Chemicals Based on Mode of Action Using Connectivity Mapping.,"Connectivity mapping is a method used in the pharmaceutical industry to find connections between small molecules, disease states, and genes. The concept can be applied to a predictive toxicology paradigm to find connections between chemicals, adverse events, and genes. In order to assess the applicability of the technique for predictive toxicology purposes, we performed gene array experiments on 34 different chemicals: bisphenol A, genistein, ethinyl-estradiol, tamoxifen, clofibrate, dehydorepiandrosterone, troglitazone, diethylhexyl phthalate, flutamide, trenbolone, phenobarbital, retinoic acid, thyroxine, 1??,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, clobetasol, farnesol, chenodeoxycholic acid, progesterone, RU486, ketoconazole, valproic acid, desferrioxamine, amoxicillin, 6-aminonicotinamide, metformin, phenformin, methotrexate, vinblastine, ANIT (1-naphthyl isothiocyanate), griseofulvin, nicotine, imidacloprid, vorinostat, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) at the 6-, 24-, and 48-hour time points for 3 different concentrations in the 4 cell lines: MCF7, Ishikawa, HepaRG, and HepG2 GEO (super series accession no.: GSE69851). The 34 chemicals were grouped in to predefined mode of action (MOA)-based chemical classes based on current literature. Connectivity mapping was used to find linkages between each chemical and between chemical classes. Cell line-specific linkages were compared with each other and to test whether the method was platform and user independent, a similar analysis was performed against publicly available data. The study showed that the method can group chemicals based on MOAs and the inter-chemical class comparison alluded to connections between MOAs that were not predefined. Comparison to the publicly available data showed that the method is user and platform independent. The results provide an example of an alternate data analysis process for high-content data, beneficial for predictive toxicology, especially when grouping chemicals for read across purposes.","['21st century tox.', 'connectivity mapping', 'toxicogenomics']","['K Nadira De Abrew', 'Raghunandan M Kainkaryam', 'Yuqing K Shan', 'Gary J Overmann', 'Raja S Settivari', 'Xiaohong Wang', 'Jun Xu', 'Rachel L Adams', 'Jay P Tiesman', 'Edward W Carney', 'Jorge M Naciff', 'George P Daston']"
0,Predictive models of cytotoxicity as mediated by exposure to chemicals or drugs.,"Predicting cytotoxicity is a challenging task because of the complex biological mechanisms behind it. Cytotoxicity due to toxin - biologically produced poison - is known to play a substantial role in a disease process. Two objectives in this research are to derive robust general predictive cytotoxicity models to minimize unnecessary toxicity. The first objective is to build accurate predictive statistical models for cytotoxicity data based on lymphoblastoid cell lines obtained from in vitro studies. This could be an important step for accomplishing a goal in biomedecial/biophamarceutical research, by obtaining the best medical outcomes by minimizing toxicity in regard to a person's genetic profile. The second objective is to build predictive models to predict population-level cytotoxicity for unknown compounds based on chemical structural features. These two objectives were accomplished by a proposed variable selection process, the random forests, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. We achieved an excellent prediction result with the random forests algorithm using SNP markers from the proposed approach, having the smallest root mean squared error among the teams which participated in the DREAM Toxicogenetics Challenge. Since chemical compounds for drugs have great influence on human health, the predictive statistical models for these objectives could be helpful to government agencies in relevant decision-making.

0,Cellular accumulation and lipid binding of perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs) - A comparison with lysosomotropic drugs.,"Many chemicals accumulate in organisms through a variety of different mechanisms. Cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) accumulate in lysosomes and bind to membranes causing phospholipidosis, whereas many lipophilic chemicals target adipose tissue. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are widely used as surfactants, but many of them are highly bioaccumulating and persistent in the environment, making them notorious environmental toxicants. Understanding the mechanisms of their bioaccumulation is, therefore, important for their regulation and substitution with new, less harmful chemicals. We compared the highly bioaccumulative perfluorooctanesulfonic acid PFOS to its three less bioaccumulative alternatives perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), in their ability to accumulate and remain in lung epithelial cells (NCI-H292) and adipocytes (3T3-L1K) in vitro. As a reference point we tested a set of cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs), known to highly accumulate in cells and strongly bind to phospholipids, together with their respective non-CAD controls. Finally, all compounds were examined for their ability to bind to neutral lipids and phospholipids in cell-free systems. Cellular accumulation and retention of the test compounds were highly correlated between the lung epithelial cells and adipocytes. Interestingly, although an anion itself, intensities of PFOS accumulation and retention in cells were comparable to those of CAD compounds, but PFOS failed to induce phospholipidosis or alter lysosomal volume. Compared to other lipophilicity measures, phospholipophilicity shows the highest correlation (R??2?€?=?€?0.75) to cellular accumulation data in both cell types and best distinguishes between high and low accumulating compounds. This indicates that binding to phospholipids may be the most important component in driving high cellular accumulation in lung epithelial cells, as well as in adipocytes, and for both CADs and bioaccumulating PFASs. Obtained continuous PLS models based on compound's affinity for phospholipids and neutral lipids can be used as good prediction models of cellular accumulation and retention of PFASs and CADs.","['Adipocytes', 'Bioaccumulation', 'Cationic amphiphilic drugs', 'PFOS', 'Perfluorinated compounds', 'Phospholipid binding']","['Diana Sanchez Garcia', 'Marcus Sj??din', 'Magnus Hellstrandh', 'Ulf Norinder', 'Violetta Nikiforova', 'Johan Lindberg', 'Emma Wincent', '??ke Bergman', 'Ian Cotgreave', 'Vesna Munic Kos']"

0,Evaluation of food-relevant chemicals in the ToxCast high-throughput screening program.,"Thousands of chemicals are directly added to or come in contact with food, many of which have undergone little to no toxicological evaluation. The landscape of the food-relevant chemical universe was evaluated using cheminformatics, and subsequently the bioactivity of food-relevant chemicals across the publicly available ToxCast highthroughput screening program was assessed. In total, 8659 food-relevant chemicals were compiled including direct food additives, food contact substances, and pesticides. Of these food-relevant chemicals, 4719 had curated structure definition files amenable to defining chemical fingerprints, which were used to cluster chemicals using a selforganizing map approach. Pesticides, and direct food additives clustered apart from one another with food contact substances generally in between, supporting that these categories not only reflect different uses but also distinct chemistries. Subsequently, 1530 food-relevant chemicals were identified in ToxCast comprising 616 direct food additives, 371 food contact substances, and 543 pesticides. Bioactivity across ToxCast was filtered for cytotoxicity to identify selective chemical effects. Initiating analyses from strictly chemical-based methodology or bioactivity/cytotoxicity-driven evaluation presents unbiased approaches for prioritizing chemicals. Although bioactivity in??vitro is not necessarily predictive of adverse effects in??vivo, these data provide insight into chemical properties and cellular targets through which foodrelevant chemicals elicit bioactivity.

0,Bioaccumulation and analytics of pharmaceutical residues in the environment: A review.,"The presence of pharmaceutical residues in various environmental compartments is an issue of increasing concern. The widespread occurrence of these compounds in water and soil samples has been demonstrated in a number of analytical studies. However, the data about their concentrations in biota samples is scarce. Moreover, the trophic transfer of pharmaceuticals remains largely unexplored, despite increasing evidence of the potential bioaccumulation of those compounds. Therefore, the main aim of this review is to present an overview of the current state of data about the bioaccumulation and analytical methodologies used for the determination of pharmaceutical residues in biota samples. This work focuses on the most commonly found pharmaceuticals in the environment: antibiotics, analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid hormones, antihypertensives and antidepressants. We do hope that the collected data will allow a better understanding of pharmaceutical pollution and the exposure of non-target organisms. However, although impressive progress has undoubtedly been made, in order to fully understand the behavior of these chemicals in the environment, there are still numerous gaps to be filled in our overall knowledge in this field.

0,Elucidating the impact of microbial community biodiversity on pharmaceutical biotransformation during wastewater treatment.,"In addition to removing organics and other nutrients, the microorganisms in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) biotransform many pharmaceuticals present in wastewater. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between pharmaceutical biotransformation and biodiversity in WWTP bioreactor microbial communities and identify taxa and functional genes that were strongly associated with biotransformation. Dilution-to-extinction of an activated sludge microbial community was performed to establish cultures with a gradient of microbial biodiversity. Batch experiments were performed using the dilution cultures to determine biotransformation extents of several environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals. With this approach, because the communities were all established from the same original community, and using sequencing of the 16S rRNA and metatranscriptome, we identified candidate taxa and genes whose activity and transcript abundances associated with the extent of individual pharmaceutical biotransformation and were lost across the biodiversity gradient. Metabolic genes such as dehydrogenases, amidases and monooxygenases were significantly associated with pharmaceutical biotransformation, and five genera were identified whose activity significantly associated with pharmaceutical biotransformation. Understanding how biotransformation relates to biodiversity will inform the design of biological WWTPs for enhanced removal of chemicals that negatively impact environmental health.",[],"['Lauren B Stadler', 'Jeseth Delgado Vela', 'Sunit Jain', 'Gregory J Dick', 'Nancy G Love']"
0,Analysis of Pfizer compounds in EPA's ToxCast chemicals-assay space.,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched the ToxCast program in 2007 with the goal of evaluating high-throughput in vitro assays to prioritize chemicals that need toxicity testing. Their goal was to develop predictive bioactivity signatures for toxic compounds using a set of in vitro assays and/or in silico properties. In 2009, Pfizer joined the ToxCast initiative by contributing 52 compounds with preclinical and clinical data for profiling across the multiple assay platforms available. Here, we describe the initial analysis of the Pfizer subset of compounds within the ToxCast chemical (n = 1814) and in vitro assay (n = 486) space. An analysis of the hit rate of Pfizer compounds in the ToxCast assay panel allowed us to focus our mining of assays potentially most relevant to the attrition of our compounds. We compared the bioactivity profile of Pfizer compounds to other compounds in the ToxCast chemical space to gain insights into common toxicity pathways. Additionally, we explored the similarity in the chemical and biological spaces between drug-like compounds and environmental chemicals in ToxCast and compared the in vivo profiles of a subset of failed pharmaceuticals having high similarity in both spaces. We found differences in the chemical and biological spaces of pharmaceuticals compared to environmental chemicals, which may question the applicability of bioactivity signatures developed exclusively based on the latter to drug-like compounds if used without prior validation with the ToxCast Phase-II chemicals. Finally, our analysis has allowed us to identify novel interactions for our compounds in particular with multiple nuclear receptors that were previously not known. This insight may help us to identify potential liabilities with future novel compounds. ",[],"['Falgun Shah', 'Nigel Greene']"

Hence, their impact on non-target organisms like fish would not be surprising. In this respect, we revisited fish toxicity data of pharmaceuticals to generate linear and non-linear quantitative structure-toxicity relationships (QSTRs). We predicted fish lethality data from the validated QSTR models for 120 APIs with no experimental fish toxicity data. Toxicity of APIs on aquatic organisms is not fully characterized. Therefore, to provide a mechanistic insight for the assessment of API's toxicity to fish, the outcome of the derived QSTR models was integrated with structure-based toxicophore and molecular docking studies, utilizing the biomarker enzyme acetylcholinesterase originating from fish Torpedo californica (TcAChE). Toxicophore virtual screening of 60 chemicals with pT?€?>?€?0 identified 23 hits as potential TcAChE binders with binding free energies ranging from -6.5 to -12.9?€?kcal/mol. The TcAChE-ligand interaction analysis revealed a good nesting of all 23 hits within TcAChE binding site through establishing strong lipophilic and hydrogen bonding interactions with the surrounding key amino acid residues. Among the chemicals passing the criteria of our integrated approach, majority of APIs belong noticeably to the Central Nervous System class. The screened chemicals displayed not only comprehensive toxicophore coverage, but also strong binding affinities according to the docking calculations, mainly due to interactions with TcAChE's key amino acid residues Tyr121, Tyr130, Tyr334, Trp84, Phe290, Phe330, Phe331, Ser122, and Ser200. Moreover, we propose here that binding of pharmaceuticals to AChE might have a potential in triggering molecular initiating events for adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), which in turn can play an important role for future screening of APIs lacking fish lethality data.","['AChE (Torpedo californica)', 'Active pharmaceutical ingredients', 'Fish toxicity', 'Molecular docking', 'QSTR', 'Structure-based toxicophores']","['Nikola Minovski', 'Melek T??rker Sa??an', 'Elif Merve Emino??lu', 'Safiye Sa??

This study assessed the contamination of food by chemicals used in human pharmaceuticals (HPs), veterinary medicines (VMs), and personal care products (PCPs). A prioritization study was undertaken to identify the chemicals and food-producing scenarios most likely to result in contamination of food. Around 400 samples of mushrooms, vegetables, aquaculture products, and animal tissues were collected from sites in the United Kingdom, along with aquaculture products imported from Southeast Asia. A number of multianalyte methods were developed and validated for the analysis of the prioritized compounds in these samples. The analysis of all sample-method combinations required approximately 18000 determinations. Around 325 individual residues, including parabens, musk compounds, and antibiotics, were detected in 118 individual samples, but mostly at low nanograms per gram concentrations. Results suggest that the limited contamination of target chemicals occurred in the realistic food-producing scenarios investigated.

0,Identifying new persistent and bioaccumulative organics among chemicals in commerce II: pharmaceuticals.,"The goal of this study was to identify commercial pharmaceuticals that might be persistent and bioaccumulative (P&B) and that were not being considered in current wastewater and aquatic environmental measurement programs. We developed a database of 3193 pharmaceuticals from two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) databases and some lists of top ranked or selling drugs. Of the 3193 pharmaceuticals, 275 pharmaceuticals have been found in the environment and 399 pharmaceuticals were, based upon production volumes, designated as high production volume (HPV) pharmaceuticals. All pharmaceuticals that had reported chemical structures were evaluated for potential bioaccumulation (B) or persistence (P) using quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR) or scientific judgment. Of the 275 drugs detected in the environment, 92 were rated as potentially bioaccumulative, 121 were rated as potentially persistent, and 99 were HPV pharmaceuticals. After removing the 275 pharmaceuticals previously detected in the environment, 58 HPV compounds were identified that were both P&B and 48 were identified as P only. Of the non-HPV compounds, 364 pharmaceuticals were identified that were P&B. This study has yielded some interesting and probable P&B pharmaceuticals that should be considered for further study.",[],"['Philip H Howard', 'Derek C G Muir']"

The present study rigorously evaluated the generated models, meeting the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles of robustness, validity, and transparency. The proposed global model had a broad structural coverage for the toxicity prediction of diverse chemicals (some of which are high-production volume chemicals) with no experimental toxicity data.

0,Percutaneous absorption of chemicals: developing an understanding for the treatment of disease in frogs.,"The permeable nature of frog skin presents an alternative route for the delivery of therapeutic chemicals to treat disease in frogs. However, although therapeutic chemicals are often topically applied to the skin of frogs, their pharmacokinetics have rarely been reported. To provide evidence to guide both candidate drug and formulation selection, we highlight factors expected to influence percutaneous absorption through frog skin, including the anatomy and physiology of the skin and the physicochemical properties of applied therapeutic chemicals. Importantly, we also highlight the effects of the formulation on percutaneous absorption, especially the inclusion of potential penetration enhancers as excipients. Finally, we collate empirical data on the topical application of various therapeutic chemicals in postmetamorphic frogs and show that, in contrast to mammalian species, even large chemicals (i.e. >500??Da) and those with a wide range of log P values (-4 through +6) are likely to be absorbed percutaneously. Topical application in frogs thus promises a convenient and effective method for delivering systemic treatments of a diverse range of chemicals; however, further experimental quantification is required to ensure optimal outcomes.

Besides, partially water-soluble or insoluble chiral selectors may be exploited in the enantiomeric resolution in NACE. The high reproducibility due to low Joule heat generation and no change in BGE concentration may make NACE a routine analytical technique. These facts attracted scientists to use NACE for the chiral resolution. The present review describes the advances in the chiral separations by NACE and its application in pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis. The emphasis has been given to discuss the selection of the chiral selectors and organic solvents, applications of NACE, comparison between NACE and aqueous CE, and chiral recognition mechanism.

It is necessary to assess the toxicity caused by this situation and the associated concerns for human beings. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a common biomodel used to assess toxicity in aquatic environments. The zebrafish embryo toxicity test was selected to evaluate the acute toxicity of several drugs (diphenhydramine, gentamicin, tobramycin, enalapril and lidocaine) due to the lack of such information. Lethal and sublethal effects were detected, and the LC<sub>50</sub> values of the drugs ranged from 11.0?€?mg/L to 422??10<sup>2</sup> mg/L. For all of the drugs tested, these values were higher than the concentrations found in the natural environment. Therefore, there was a low environmental toxicological risk. Nevertheless, teratogenic effects were also recorded when embryos of zebrafish were exposed to caffeine (control drug), diphenhydramine and lidocaine at lower concentrations than the respective LC<sub>50</sub> values. Quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis was also performed to analyse these drugs and other chemicals with pharmaceutical uses as well as previous toxicological data in this vertebrate after 48?€?h of exposure. It is estimated that the partition coefficient, log P, is the main physicochemical property related to the ecotoxicological data and can be used for the development of a mathematical model.","['Acute toxicity', 'Drugs', 'Fish embryo test', 'Lethal effects', 'QSAR', 'Sublethal effects', 'Zebrafish']","['Laura Lomba', 'M Pilar Ribate', 'Estefan??a Zuriaga', 'Cristina B Garc??a', 'Beatriz Giner']"

These chemicals appear in mixtures at very low concentrations thus making their detection and quantification difficult. Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) concentrate trace levels of chemicals over time increasing method sensitivity and thus represent a cost-effective screening tool for biomonitoring studies. The Baca National Wildlife Refuge (BNWR), Colorado, is home for several endemic fish species, including Rio Grande chub (Gila pandora). The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the types and concentrations of PPCPs in the Refuge, (2) compare and contrast two methods (grab and POCIS) for the quantification of PPCPs from surface water, and (3) determine effects due to PPCP exposure in fish. Between 2011 and 2013, 141 PPCPs were quantified using a combination of grab samples and POCIS. Although no PPCPs were detected from the grab samples, high concentrations of N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) and triclosan were detected in all fish sampling sites with POCIS. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and Rio Grande chubs of both sexes were collected in 2011 and 2012. Several biological responses were observed in both species from creeks contaminated with PPCPs; however the presence of PPCPs in the reference site did not allow for valid data comparison and interpretation. We conclude that POCIS is a sensitive method for the detection and quantification of PPCPs and for identification of reference sites and that appropriate ""reference"" sites need to be identified at the BNWR for follow-up studies with native fish.

The TTC was based on the more potent rodent carcinogens, excluding the highly potent ""cohort of concern"" (COC; for mutagenic carcinogens these are N-nitroso, Aflatoxin-like, and azoxy structures). We compared molecules with DEREK ""structural alerts"" for mutagenicity used in drug syntheses with the mutagenic carcinogens in the Gold Carcinogenicity Potency Database. Data from 108 diverse synthetic routes from 13 companies confirm that many ""alerting"" or mutagenic chemicals are in structural classes with lower carcinogenic potency than those used to derive the TTC. Acceptable daily intakes can be established that are higher than the default TTC for many structural classes (e.g., mono-functional alkyl halides and certain aromatic amines). Examples of ADIs for lifetime and shorter-term exposure are given for chemicals of various potencies. The percentage of chemicals with DEREK alerts that proved mutagenic in the Ames test ranged from 36% to 83%, depending on structural class, demonstrating that such SAR analysis to ""flag"" potential mutagens is conservative.

0,In silico assessment of the acute toxicity of chemicals: recent advances and new model for multitasking prediction of toxic effect.,"The assessment of acute toxicity is one of the most important stages to ensure the safety of chemicals with potential applications in pharmaceutical sciences, biomedical research, or any other industrial branch. A huge and indiscriminate number of toxicity assays have been carried out on laboratory animals. In this sense, computational approaches involving models based on quantitative-structure activity/toxicity relationships (QSAR/QSTR) can help to rationalize time and financial costs. Here, we discuss the most significant advances in the last 6 years focused on the use of QSAR/QSTR models to predict acute toxicity of drugs/chemicals in laboratory animals, employing large and heterogeneous datasets. The advantages and drawbacks of the different QSAR/QSTR models are analyzed. As a contribution to the field, we introduce the first multitasking (mtk) QSTR model for simultaneous prediction of acute toxicity of compounds by considering different routes of administration, diverse breeds of laboratory animals, and the reliability of the experimental conditions. The mtk-QSTR model was based on artificial neural networks (ANN), allowing the classification of compounds as toxic or non-toxic. This model correctly classified more than 94% of the 1646 cases present in the whole dataset, and its applicability was demonstrated by performing predictions of different chemicals such as drugs, dietary supplements, and molecules which could serve as nanocarriers for drug delivery.

0,Novel Approach for Characterizing pH-Dependent Uptake of Ionizable Chemicals in Aquatic Organisms.,"Here, we present and evaluate a combined experimental and modeling approach for characterizing the uptake of ionizable chemicals from water and sediments into aquatic organisms under different pH conditions. We illustrate and evaluate the approach for two pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and fluoxetine) and one personal care product ingredient (triclosan) for the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus. Initially, experimental data on the uptake of the three chemicals at two pH values were fitted using a toxicokinetic model to derive uptake and depuration constants for the neutral and ionized species of each molecule. The derived constants were then used to predict uptake from water and sediment for other pH conditions. Evaluation of predictions against corresponding experimental data showed good predictions of uptake for all test chemicals from water for different pH conditions and reasonable predictions of uptake of fluoxetine and diclofenac from a sediment. Predictions demonstrated that the level of uptake of the study chemicals, across pH ranges in European streams, could differ by up to a factor of 3035. Overall, the approach could be extremely useful for assessing internal exposure of aquatic organisms across landscapes with differing pH.

Herein, a novel technique for dispersing a solid, without the need to use a surfactant, is reported. A freeze-dried amorphous sugar sample was dissolved in an organic solvent, which contained a soluble model hydrophobic component. The suspension of the sugar and the model hydrophobic component was vacuum foam dried to give a solid powder. Four types of sugars and methanol were used as representative sugars and the organic medium. Four model drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, gliclazide, and nifedipine) were employed. Differential scanning calorimetry analyses indicated that the sugar and model drug (100:1) did not undergo segregation during the drying process.

Equations have been proposed for determining the partition and diffusion properties of chemicals by considering molecular partition, binding and mobility in skin layers. In vitro skin penetration data of 12 chemicals was used to validate the model.The observed and simulated permeation and disposition in skin layers were compared for 12 tested chemicals. For most tested chemicals, the experimental and model results are in good agreement with the coefficient of determination >0.80 and relative root mean squared error <1.20. The disposition kinetic parameters of the maximum concentration and the area under the curve in the viable epidermis and dermis initially increased with hydrophobicity, but reached maxima and then decreased with further increase of hydrophobicity.By considering skin physiological structure and composition, the partition and diffusion properties of chemicals in skin layers are determined. This allows in-silico simulation of percutaneous permeation, absorption and disposition kinetics of wide chemical space.

Recent reviews advocate that PPCP occurrence, fate, and exposure need to be better predicted and characterized. The use of pharmaceutical prescription rates to estimate PPCP concentrations in the environment has been suggested. Concentrations of 7 pharmaceuticals (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, fenoprofen, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen) were measured in municipal wastewater using gas chromatography/ion trap-tandem mass spectroscopy (GC/IT-MS/MS). Subregional pharmaceutical prescription data were investigated to determine whether they could predict measured effluent concentrations (MECs) in wastewaters. Predicted effluent concentrations (PECs) for 5 of the 7 pharmaceuticals were within 2-fold agreement of the MECs when the fraction of parent pharmaceutical excreted was not considered. When the fraction of parent pharmaceutical excreted was considered, the respective PECs decreased, and most were within an order of magnitude of the MECs. Regression relationships of monthly PECs versus MECs were statistically significant (p < 0.05) but weak (R(2) = 0.18-0.56) for all pharmaceuticals except ketoprofen. This suggests high variability in the data and may be the result of factors influencing MECs such as the analytical methods used, wastewater sampling frequency, and methodology. The PECs were based solely on prescription rates and did not account for inputs of pharmaceuticals that had a significant over-the-counter component or were from other sources (e.g., hospitals).","['Environmental assessment', 'Measured and predicted concentrations', 'Pharmaceuticals', 'Prescription drugs', 'Wastewater effluent']","['Leslie J Saunders', 'Asit Mazumder', 'Christopher J Lowe']"
0,Presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the continuum of surface and ground water used in drinking water production.,"Anthropogenic chemicals in surface water and groundwater cause concern especially when the water is used in drinking water production. Due to their continuous release or spill-over at waste water treatment plants, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are constantly present in aquatic environment and despite their low concentrations, APIs can still cause effects on the organisms. In the present study, Chemcatcher passive sampling was applied in surface water, surface water intake site, and groundwater observation wells to estimate whether the selected APIs are able to end up in drinking water supply through an artificial groundwater recharge system. The API concentrations measured in conventional wastewater, surface water, and groundwater grab samples were assessed with the results obtained with passive samplers. Out of the 25 APIs studied with passive sampling, four were observed in groundwater and 21 in surface water. This suggests that many anthropogenic APIs released to waste water proceed downstream and can be detectable in groundwater recharge. Chemcatcher passive samplers have previously been used in monitoring several harmful chemicals in surface and wastewaters, but the path of chemicals to groundwater has not been studied.

0,"A compilation of safety impact information for extractables associated with materials used in pharmaceutical packaging, delivery, administration, and manufacturing systems.","Demonstrating suitability for intended use is necessary to register packaging, delivery/administration, or manufacturing systems for pharmaceutical products. During their use, such systems may interact with the pharmaceutical product, potentially adding extraneous entities to those products. These extraneous entities, termed leachables, have the potential to affect the product's performance and/or safety. To establish the potential safety impact, drug products and their packaging, delivery, or manufacturing systems are tested for leachables or extractables, respectively. This generally involves testing a sample (either the extract or the drug product) by a means that produces a test method response and then correlating the test method response with the identity and concentration of the entity causing the response. Oftentimes, analytical tests produce responses that cannot readily establish the associated entity's identity. Entities associated with un-interpretable responses are termed unknowns. Scientifically justifiable thresholds are used to establish those individual unknowns that represent an acceptable patient safety risk and thus which do not require further identification and, conversely, those unknowns whose potential safety impact require that they be identified. Such thresholds are typically based on the statistical analysis of datasets containing toxicological information for more or less relevant compounds. This article documents toxicological information for over 540 extractables identified in laboratory testing of polymeric materials used in pharmaceutical applications. Relevant toxicological endpoints, such as NOELs (no observed effects), NOAELs (no adverse effects), TDLOs (lowest published toxic dose), and others were collated for these extractables or their structurally similar surrogates and were systematically assessed to produce a risk index, which represents a daily intake value for life-long intravenous administration. This systematic approach uses four uncertainty factors, each assigned a factor of 10, which consider the quality and relevance of the data, differences in route of administration, non-human species to human extrapolations, and inter-individual variation among humans. In addition to the risk index values, all extractables and most of their surrogates were classified for structural safety alerts using Cramer rules and for mutagenicity alerts using an in silico approach (Benigni/Bossa rule base for mutagenicity via Toxtree). Lastly, in vitro mutagenicity data (Ames Salmonella typimurium and Mouse Lymphoma tests) were collected from available databases (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information and Carcinogenic Potency Database). The frequency distributions of the resulting data were established; in general risk index values were normally distributed around a band ranging from 5 to 20 mg/day. The risk index associated with 95% level of the cumulative distribution plot was approximately 0.1 mg/day. Thirteen extractables in the dataset had individual risk index values less than 0.1 mg/day, although four of these had additional risk indices, based on multiple different toxicological endpoints, above 0.1 mg/day. Additionally, approximately 50% of the extractables were classified in Cramer Class 1 (low risk of toxicity) and approximately 35% were in Cramer Class 3 (no basis to assume safety). Lastly, roughly 20% of the extractables triggered either an in vitro or in silico alert for mutagenicity. When Cramer classifications and the mutagenicity alerts were compared to the risk indices, extractables with safety alerts generally had lower risk index values, although the differences in the risk index data distributions, extractables with or without alerts, were small and subtle.Leachables from packaging systems, manufacturing systems, or delivery devices can accumulate in drug products and potentially affect the drug product. Although drug products can be analyzed for leachables (and material extracts can be analyzed for extractables), not all leachables or extractables can be fully identified. Safety thresholds can be used to establish whether the unidentified substances can be deemed to be safe or whether additional analytical efforts need to be made to secure the identities. These thresholds are typically based on the statistical analysis of datasets containing toxicological information for more or less relevant compounds. This article contains safety data for over 500 extractables that were identified in laboratory characterizations of polymers used in pharmaceutical applications. The safety data consists of structural toxicity classifications of the extractables as well as calculated risk indices, where the risk indices were obtained by subjecting toxicological safety data, such as NOELs (no observed effects), NOAELs (no adverse effects), TDLOs (lowest published toxic dose), and others to a systematic evaluation process using appropriate uncertainty factors. Thus the risk index values represent daily exposures for the lifetime intravenous administration of drugs. The frequency distributions of the risk indices and Cramer classifications were examined. The risk index values were normally distributed around a range of 5 to 20 mg/day, and the risk index associated with the 95% level of the cumulative frequency plot was 0.1 mg/day. Approximately 50% of the extractables were in Cramer Class 1 (low risk of toxicity) and approximately 35% were in Cramer Class 3 (high risk of toxicity). Approximately 20% of the extractables produced an in vitro or in silico mutagenicity alert. In general, the distribution of risk index values was not strongly correlated with the either extractables' Cramer classification or by mutagenicity alerts. However, extractables with either in vitro or in silico alerts were somewhat more likely to have low risk index values.","['Extractables', 'Leachables', 'Risk index (RI)', 'Safety assessment', 'Thresholds', 'Toxicological risk assessment']","['Dennis Jenke', 'Tage Carlson']"
0,Estimation of elimination half-lives of organic chemicals in humans using gradient boosting machine.,"Elimination half-life is an important pharmacokinetic parameter that determines exposure duration to approach steady state of drugs and regulates drug administration. The experimental evaluation of half-life is time-consuming and costly. Thus, it is attractive to build an accurate prediction model for half-life.In this study, several machine learning methods, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector regressions (RBF-SVR and Linear-SVR), local lazy regression (LLR), SA, SR, and GP, were employed to build high-quality prediction models. Two strategies of building consensus models were explored to improve the accuracy of prediction. Moreover, the applicability domains (ADs) of the models were determined by using the distance-based threshold.Among seven individual models, GBM showed the best performance (R(2)=0.820 and RMSE=0.555 for the test set), and Linear-SVR produced the inferior prediction accuracy (R(2)=0.738 and RMSE=0.672). The use of distance-based ADs effectively determined the scope of QSAR models. However, the consensus models by combing the individual models could not improve the prediction performance. Some essential descriptors relevant to half-life were identified and analyzed.An accurate prediction model for elimination half-life was built by GBM, which was superior to the reference model (R(2)=0.723 and RMSE=0.698).Encouraged by the promising results, we expect that the GBM model for elimination half-life would have potential applications for the early pharmacokinetic evaluations, and provide guidance for designing drug candidates with favorable in vivo exposure profile.

0,Response of gene expression in zebrafish exposed to pharmaceutical mixtures: Implications for environmental risk.,"Complex mixtures of pharmaceutical chemicals in surface waters indicate potential for mixture effects in aquatic organisms. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether effects on target gene expression and enzymatic activity of individual substances at environmentally relevant concentrations were additive when mixed. Expression of zebrafish cytochrome P4501A (cyp1a) and vitellogenin (vtg) genes as well as activity of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) were analyzed after exposure (96h) to caffeine-Caf, ibuprofen-Ibu, and carbamazepine-Cbz (0.05 and 5??M), tamoxifen-Tmx (0.003 and 0.3??M), and after exposure to pharmaceutical mixtures (low mix: 0.05??M of Caf, Ibu, Cbz and 0.003??M of Tmx, and high mix: 5??M of Caf, Ibu, Cbz and 0.3??M of Tmx). Pharmaceuticals tested individually caused significant down regulation of both cyp1a and vtg, but EROD activity was not affected. Exposure to low mix did not cause a significant change in gene expression; however, the high mix caused significant up-regulation of cyp1a but did not affect vtg expression. Up-regulation of cyp1a was consistent with induction of EROD activity in larvae exposed to high mix. The complex mixture induced different responses than those observed by the individual substances. Additive toxicity was not supported, and results indicate the need to evaluate complex mixtures rather than models based on individual effects, since in environment drugs are not found in isolation and the effects of their mixtures is poorly understood.","['Fish', 'Gene expression', 'Mixtures', 'Pharmaceuticals', 'Q-PCR', 'Toxicogenomics']","['Gabriela V Aguirre-Mart??nez', 'Helena C Reinardy', 'M Laura Mart??n-D??az', 'Theodore B Henry']"
0,The Role of Extracellular Binding Proteins in the Cellular Uptake of Drugs: Impact on Quantitative In Vitro-to-In Vivo Extrapolations of Toxicity and Efficacy in Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Research.,"A critical component in the development of physiologically based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) models for estimating target organ dosimetry in pharmacology and toxicology studies is the understanding of the uptake kinetics and accumulation of drugs and chemicals at the cellular level. Therefore, predicting free drug concentrations in intracellular fluid will contribute to our understanding of concentrations at the site of action in cells in PBPK/PD research. Some investigators believe that uptake of drugs in cells is solely driven by the unbound fraction; conversely, others argue that the protein-bound fraction contributes a significant portion of the total amount delivered to cells. Accordingly, the current literature suggests the existence of a so-called albumin-mediated uptake mechanism(s) for the protein-bound fraction (i.e., extracellular protein-facilitated uptake mechanisms) at least in hepatocytes and cardiac myocytes; however, such mechanism(s) and cells from other organs deserve further exploration. Therefore, the main objective of this present study was to discuss further the implication of potential protein-facilitated uptake mechanism(s) on drug distribution in cells under in vivo conditions. The interplay between the protein-facilitated uptake mechanism(s) and the effects of a pH gradient, metabolism, transport, and permeation limitation potentially occurring in cells was also discussed, as this should violate the basic assumption on similar free drug concentration in cells and plasma. This was made because the published equations used to calculate drug concentrations in cells in a PBPK/PD model did not consider potential protein-facilitated uptake mechanism(s). Consequently, we corrected some published equations for calculating the free drug concentrations in cells compared with plasma in PBPK/PD modeling studies, and we proposed a refined strategy for potentially performing more accurate quantitative in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolations (IVIVEs) of toxicity (efficacy) at the cellular level from data generated in cell assays. Overall, this present study may help to optimize the human dose prediction in preclinical and clinical studies, while prescribing drugs with narrow therapeutic windows that are highly bound to extracellular proteins and/or highly ionized at the physiological pH. This may facilitate building a more accurate safety (efficacy) profile for such drugs.","['ADME', 'IVIVE', 'PKPD', 'clearance', 'disposition', 'distribution', 'hepatocytes', 'partition coefficients', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacokinetics']","['Patrick Poulin', 'Frank J Burczynski', 'Sami Haddad']"

Over the years, the exploration of microbial, animal and plant metabolism has generated a wealth of valuable genetic information. The prudent application of this knowledge on cellular metabolism and biochemistry has enabled the construction of novel metabolic pathways that do not exist in nature or enhance existing ones. The hand in hand development of computational technology, protein science and genetic manipulation tools has formed the basis of powerful emerging technologies that make the production of green chemicals and fuels a reality. Microbial production of chemicals is more feasible compared to plant and animal systems, due to simpler genetic make-up and amenable growth rates.

0,"Occurrence and fate of emerging trace organic chemicals in wastewater plants in Chennai, India.","The presence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, pesticides and industrial contaminants collectively termed as trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in wastewater has been well-documented in USA, Europe, China and other regions. However, data from India, the second most populous country in the world is severely lacking. This study investigated the occurrence and concentrations of twenty-two indicator TOrCs at three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in South India serving diverse communities across three sampling campaigns. Samples were collected after each WWTP treatment unit and removal efficiencies for TOrCs were determined. Eleven TOrCs were detected in every sample from every location at all sites, while only five TOrCs were detected consistently in effluent samples. Caffeine was present at greatest concentration in the influent of all three plants with average concentrations ranging between 56 and 65??g/L. In contrast, the x-ray contrast media pharmaceutical, iohexol, was the highest detected compound on average in the effluent at all three WWTPs (2.1-8.7??g/L). TOrCs were not completely removed in the WWTPs with removal efficiencies being compound specific and most of the attenuation being attributed to the biological treatment processes. Caffeine and triclocarban were well removed (>80%), while other compounds were poorly removed (acesulfame, sucralose, iohexol) or maybe even formed (carbamazepine) within the WWTPs. The effluent composition of the 22 TOrCs were similar within the three WWTPs but quite different to those seen in the US, indicating the importance of region-specific monitoring. Diurnal trends indicated that variability is compound specific but trended within certain classes of compounds (artificial sweeteners, and pharmaceuticals). The data collected on TOrCs from this study can be used as a baseline to identify potential remediation and regulatory strategies in this understudied region of India.","['Emerging contaminants', 'India', 'Indicator chemicals', 'Pharmaceuticals', 'Tracers', 'Wastewater treatment']","['Tarun Anumol', 'Arya Vijayanandan', 'Minkyu Park', 'Ligy Philip', 'Shane A Snyder']"
1,Detection of colon flora in peritoneal drain fluid after colorectal surgery: can RT-PCR play a role in diagnosing anastomotic leakage?,"A semi-quantitative Real-Time PCR strategy was developed to identify potential indicator organisms for anastomotic leakage in peritoneal drainage fluid, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. The analytical performance of the amplification method was validated with 10 culture-positive and 7 culture-negative peritoneal drain fluid samples, obtained from 9 different patients with a colorectal anastomosis. Real-Time PCR results were fully concordant with the microbiological culture results. However, among the culture-negative samples, four false-positive RT-PCR results were found. All false-positives originated from a single patient with a surgical site infection. This may indicate an elevated sensitivity of the RT-PCR method. The results showed that the semi-quantitative RT-PCR method has a clear potential to be useful as a powerful tool in early detection of anastomotic leakage.",[],"['N Komen', 'M C Morsink', 'S Beiboer', 'A Miggelbrink', 'P Willemsen', 'E van der Harst', 'J F Lange', 'W B van Leeuwen']"
1,"Time of drug administration, CYP3A5 and ABCB1 genotypes, and analytical method influence tacrolimus pharmacokinetics: a population pharmacokinetic study.","Tacrolimus (TAC) pharmacokinetics are characterized by a very high variability that complicates its therapeutic use. The aims of this study were: 1) to identify and model the effect of demographic, clinical, and genetic factors and time of drug administration on TAC pharmacokinetic variability; and 2) to assess the influence of the analytical method by modeling the TAC blood concentrations measured simultaneously by microparticle enzyme immune assay (MEIA) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. Data from 19 renal transplant candidates were analyzed. A total of 266 blood samples were analyzed for TAC by both techniques. Linear regression and Bland and Altman analyses were performed to compare TAC blood concentrations obtained with MEIA and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. As expected, blood concentrations obtained by MEIA were higher than those obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination best fit TAC blood concentrations. An exponential model was used to describe the interindividual and interoccasion variability and a mixed model was retained for the residual variability. A supplementary proportional term was necessary for the residual error in case of TAC blood concentrations determined by MEIA. The following covariates were retained in the final model: time of drug administration on the absorption rate constant and CYP3A5 and ABCB1 genotypes on the TAC apparent clearance. All parameter estimates had reliable values. The final model was found to be stable and generated parameters with good precision. The validation of the final model by bootstrapping (2000 bootstraps), case deletion diagnostics, crossvalidation, and visual predictive check (1000 simulated subjects) gave satisfactory results. This is the first population pharmacokinetic study confirming the chronopharmacokinetics of TAC and showing an effect of ABCB1 genotype and analytical method on TAC pharmacokinetics.

1,"Controlling tissue microenvironments: biomimetics, transport phenomena, and reacting systems.","The reconstruction of tissues ex vivo and production of cells capable of maintaining a stable performance for extended time periods in sufficient quantity for synthetic or therapeutic purposes are primary objectives of tissue engineering. The ability to characterize and manipulate the cellular microenvironment is critical for successful implementation of such cell-based bioengineered systems. As a result, knowledge of fundamental biomimetics, transport phenomena, and reaction engineering concepts is essential to system design and development. Once the requirements of a specific tissue microenvironment are understood, the biomimetic system specifications can be identified and a design implemented. Utilization of novel membrane systems that are engineered to possess unique transport and reactive features is one successful approach presented here.

1,Expansion of patient-derived circulating tumor cells from liquid biopsies using a CTC microfluidic culture device.,"The development of personalized cancer therapy depends on a robust system to monitor the patient's individual response to anticancer treatment. Anticancer drug efficacy has been tested on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from patient blood samples after ex vivo expansion into CTC clusters. Current attempts to culture these primary cancer cells focus on long-term maintenance under growth factor supplements into cell lines, which usually takes >6 months and results in a CTC expansion efficiency of <20%. We recently developed a simple but unique microfluidics-based culture approach that requires minimal preprocessing (???30 min) and does not require prior enrichment of CTCs or depend on the use of growth factor supplements. The approach capitalizes on co-culture of immune cells from the same patient blood sample within specially designed microwells that promote CTC cluster formation within 2 weeks, with an overall cluster formation success rate of ???50%. Drug screening is facilitated by the incorporation of a gradient generator for parallel exposure to two or more drugs at various concentrations. Owing to the cost-effectiveness and less-invasive nature of this procedure, routine monitoring of disease progression can be achieved. The described microfluidics system can be operated with a single syringe pump to introduce drug compounds (which takes ???6 min), followed by incubation of the CTC clusters for 48 h before analysis. In addition to its applications in biomedical research, the rapid readout of our platform will enable clinicians to assess or predict a patient's response to various therapeutic strategies, so as to enable personalized or precision therapy.",[],"['Bee Luan Khoo', 'Gianluca Grenci', 'Ying Bena Lim', 'Soo Chin Lee', 'Jongyoon Han', 'Chwee Teck Lim']"

1,Microfluidic cell arrays in tumor analysis: new prospects for integrated cytomics.,"The recent introduction of molecularly targeted anticancer therapeutics has revealed a great need for a new class of clinical bioassays. The shift from cytotoxic chemotherapy to biomolecular therapeutics requires that efficacy is assessed at the biologically active dose that modulates the target, rather than using the conventional dose-toxicity relationship. In this context, functional cytomics is slowly becoming an omnipotent part of the post-genomic drug-discovery pipelines. Although, it is widely recognized in the drug-discovery arena that the validation of therapeutic targets revealed by proteomic and genetic screens requires functional cell-based assays, their widespread clinical applications are still underdeveloped. In this context, microfluidic cell array technologies provide important technological advances that allow for fundamentally new capabilities in the spatiotemporal control of molecules and cells. Pioneering lab-on-a-chip devices, such as microfluidic cell arrays, allow for a lucid integration of multiparameter data, obtained from functional cell-based assays, as well as from proteomic and genetic screening. They also offer opportunities for fabrication of parallelized and fully addressable perfusion microarrays aiming at greatly reduced equipment costs, simplified operation, increased sensitivity and throughput by implementing, for example, a parallel processing principle. Lab-on-a-chip microfluidic cell arrays therefore provide new opportunities for the development of content-rich personalized clinical diagnostics and higher-throughput clinical screening in oncology.",[],"['Donald Wlodkowic', 'Jonathan M Cooper']"
1,Toward Monitoring Parkinson's Through Analysis of Static Handwriting Samples: A Quantitative Analytical Framework.,"Detection of changes in micrographia as a manifestation of symptomatic progression or therapeutic response in Parkinson's disease (PD) is challenging as such changes can be subtle. A computerized toolkit based on quantitative analysis of handwriting samples would be valuable as it could supplement and support clinical assessments, help monitor micrographia, and link it to PD. Such a toolkit would be especially useful if it could detect subtle yet relevant changes in handwriting morphology, thus enhancing resolution of the detection procedure. This would be made possible by developing a set of metrics sensitive enough to detect and discern micrographia with specificity. Several metrics that are sensitive to the characteristics of micrographia were developed, with minimal sensitivity to confounding handwriting artifacts. These metrics capture character size-reduction, ink utilization, and pixel density within a writing sample from left to right. They are used here to ""score"" handwritten signatures of 12 different individuals corresponding to healthy and symptomatic PD conditions, and sample control signatures that had been artificially reduced in size for comparison purposes. Moreover, metric analyses of samples from ten of the 12 individuals for which clinical diagnosis time is known show considerable informative variations when applied to static signature samples obtained before and after diagnosis. In particular, a measure called pixel density variation showed statistically significant differences ( ) between two comparison groups of remote signature recordings: earlier versus recent, based on independent and paired t-test analyses on a total of 40 signature samples. The quantitative framework developed here has the potential to be used in future controlled experiments to study micrographia and links to PD from various aspects, including monitoring and assessment of applied interventions and treatments. The inherent value in this methodology is further enhanced by its reliance solely on static signatures, not requiring dynamic sampling with specialized equipment.",[],"['Naiqian Zhi', 'Beverly Kris Jaeger', 'Andrew Gouldstone', 'Rifat Sipahi', 'Samuel Frank']"
1,SIFT-MS and FA-MS methods for ambient gas phase analysis: developments and applications in the UK.,"Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry, SIFT-MS, a relatively new gas/vapour phase analytical method, is derived from the much earlier selected ion flow tube, SIFT, used for the study of gas phase ion-molecule reactions. Both the SIFT and SIFT-MS techniques were conceived and developed in the UK, the former at Birmingham University, the latter at Keele University along with the complementary flowing afterglow mass spectrometry, FA-MS, technique. The focus of this short review is largely to describe the origins, developments and, most importantly, the unique features of SIFT-MS as an analytical tool for ambient analysis and to indicate its growing use to analyse humid air, especially exhaled breath, its unique place as a on-line, real time analytical method and its growing use and applications as a non-invasive diagnostic in clinical diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring, principally within several UK universities and hospitals, and briefly in the wider world. A few case studies are outlined that show the potential of SIFT-MS and FA-MS in the detection and quantification of metabolites in exhaled breath as a step towards recognising pathophysiology indicative of disease and the presence of bacterial and fungal infection of the airways and lungs. Particular cases include the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (SIFT-MS) and the measurement of total body water in patients with chronic kidney disease (FA-MS).

1,Analytical prediction of sub-surface thermal history in translucent tissue phantoms during plasmonic photo-thermotherapy (PPTT).,"Knowledge of thermal history and/or distribution in biological tissues during laser based hyperthermia is essential to achieve necrosis of tumour/carcinoma cells. A semi-analytical model to predict sub-surface thermal distribution in translucent, soft, tissue mimics has been proposed. The model can accurately predict the spatio-temporal temperature variations along depth and the anomalous thermal behaviour in such media, viz. occurrence of sub-surface temperature peaks. Based on optical and thermal properties, the augmented temperature and shift of the peak positions in case of gold nanostructure mediated tissue phantom hyperthermia can be predicted. Employing inverse approach, the absorption coefficient of nano-graphene infused tissue mimics is determined from the peak temperature and found to provide appreciably accurate predictions along depth. Furthermore, a simplistic, dimensionally consistent correlation to theoretically determine the position of the peak in such media is proposed and found to be consistent with experiments and computations. The model shows promise in predicting thermal distribution induced by lasers in tissues and deduction of therapeutic hyperthermia parameters, thereby assisting clinical procedures by providing a priori estimates.","['Analytical model', 'Bio heat transfer', 'Gold nanostructures', 'Graphene', 'Laser hyperthermia', 'PPTT', 'Tissue mimics']","['Purbarun Dhar', 'Anup Paul', 'Arunn Narasimhan', 'Sarit K Das']"
1,Can we rely on out-of-hospital blood samples? A prospective interventional study on the pre-analytical stability of blood samples under prehospital emergency medicine conditions.,"Prehospital intravenous access provides the opportunity to sample blood from an emergency patient at the earliest possible moment in the course of acute illness and in a state prior to therapeutic interventions. Our study investigates the pre-analytical stability of biomarkers in prehospital emergency medicine and will answer the question whether an approach of blood sampling out in the field will deliver valid laboratory results.We prepared pairs of blood samples from healthy volunteers and volunteering patients post cardio-thoracic surgery. While one sample set was analysed immediately, the other one was subjected to a worse-than-reality treatment of 60??min time-lapse and standardized mechanical forces outside of the hospital through actual ambulance transport. We investigated 21 parameters comprising blood cells, coagulation tests, electrolytes, markers of haemolysis and markers of cardiac ischemia. Bland-Altman analysis was used to investigate differences between test groups. Differences between test groups were set against the official margins of test accuracy as given by the German Requirements for Quality Assurance of Medical Laboratory Examinations.Agreement between immediate analysis and our prehospital treatment is high as demonstrated by Bland-Altman plotting. Mechanical stress and time delay do not produce a systematic bias but only random inaccuracy. The limits of agreement for the tested parameters are generally within clinically acceptable ranges of variation and within the official margins as set by the German Requirements for Quality Assurance of Medical Laboratory Examinations.We subjected blood samples to a standardized treatment marking a worse-than-reality scenario of prehospital time delay and transport.

Particular attention was paid to potential interactions between reagents using a simulated routine workload.Within-run and total imprecision were assessed using a selection of representative reagents. Deviation from a consensus mean was tested using samples from a proficiency testing scheme. Method comparison using routine samples was carried out against the MODULAR ANALYTICS SWA and COBAS INTEGRA 800 analysis systems.Total coefficients of variation (CV) ranged from 1.9% to 7.8% for individual drugs, and from 3.2% to 8.6% for drugs of abuse testing. Results from proficiency test samples were between 81% and 125% of the consensus mean for therapeutic drugs. Method comparisons (Passing-Bablok regression) showed overall good comparability to MODULAR ANALYTICS SWA and COBAS INTEGRA 800 systems, with slopes from 0.93 to 1.17 and correlation coefficients r > 0.98. Imprecision in a simulated routine run was tested using a total of 42 methods (10 therapeutic drug monitoring, 9 drugs of abuse testing, 3 enzymes, 12 substrates, 8 specific protein assays). Imprecision in the reference batch run ranged from 0.7% to 5.0% CV for therapeutic drug monitoring assays, except for digoxin (DIG) (7.3%), and from 0.9% to 7.7% for drugs of abuse testing. The CVs of general clinical chemistry and specific protein tests were within the expected limits of 2% and 4%. CV changes in the simulated routine run were within the expected limits for most assays. Negative DeltaCVs (> or = 2%) for DIG, digitoxin (DIGIT), cannabinoids (THC), and phencyclidine (PCP) may indicate improved performance when running these assays in a simulated routine operation. A positive DeltaCV (> or = 3%) was found for amphetamines (AMPHs).In conclusion, the cobas c 501 module seems to be well-suited for routine use as consolidated workstation.

1,Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Lithium: A Study of the Accuracy and Analytical Variation Between Laboratories in Denmark.,"Serum lithium is monitored to ensure levels within the narrow therapeutic window. This study examines the interlaboratory variation and inaccuracy of lithium monitoring in Denmark.In 16 samples consisting of (1) control materials (n = 4), (2) pooled patient serum (n = 5), and (3) serum from individual patients (n = 7), lithium was measured in 19 laboratories using 20 different instruments. The lithium concentrations were targeted by a reference laboratory. Ion-selective electrode (n = 5), reflective spectrophotometric (RSM, n = 5), and spectrophotometric (n = 10) methods were used.Acceptable accuracy-interpreted as total differences from target values (bias) less than or equal to ??12%-was generally found in patient samples above 0.7 mmol/L. Below 0.7 mmol/L, 8 instruments had 2 or more patient samples exceeding a difference to the targeted reference value of >12%. Seven of these instruments had a systematic positive or negative bias and more so at lower lithium concentrations. Three poorly calibrated instruments were found in the ion-selective electrode group, 3 in the spectrophotometric group, and 2 in the RSM group. The instruments using reflectance spectrophotometry (RSM) were on average 21% positively biased when measuring control materials. However, this effect was not observed in patient samples.Large interlaboratory variation was found below 0.7 mmol/L because of 7 instruments with a poor accuracy and 1 with poor precision.

A transparent microfluidics-based reaction chip, where analytes were quantitatively detected by means of biospecific reactions and chemiluminescence detection, was placed in contact with a thermoelectrically cooled CCD sensor through a fiber optic taper. Such a lensless contact imaging configuration combined adequate spatial resolution and high light collection efficiency within a small size portable device. The miniaturization of the reaction chamber ensured short analysis times (in the minutes range), while the use of chemiluminescence detection provided wide signal dynamic range and high detectability, down to attomole levels of protein and femtomole levels of nucleic acid analytes. A model hybrid panel test was realized by combining an enzyme assay for alkaline phosphatase activity, a nucleic acid hybridization assay for Parvovirus B19 DNA, and an immunoassay for horseradish peroxidase as a model antigen.

Some promising success has been shown by the RIT ETA Lab research group that an antenna's resonant frequency can track, in real time, changes in glucose concentration. Based on an in-vitro study of blood samples of diabetic patients, the paper presents a modified Cole-Cole model that incorporates a factor to represent the change in glucose level. A calibration technique using the input impedance technique is discussed and the results show a good estimation as compared to the glucose meter readings. An alternate calibration methodology has been developed that is based on the shift in the antenna resonant frequency using an equivalent circuit model containing a shunt capacitor to represent the shift in resonant frequency with changing glucose levels. Work under progress is the optimization of the technique with a larger sample of patients. ",[],"['Anoop Adhyapak', 'Matthew Sidley', 'Jayanti Venkataraman']"
1,Measurement of power in selectorized strength-training equipment.,"The author derived the exact analytical expression of the instantaneous joint power in exercises with single-joint, variable-resistance, selectorized strength-training equipment, taking into account all the relevant geometric, kinematic, and dynamic variables of both the movable equipment elements (resistance input lever, cam-pulley system, weight stack) and of the user's exercising limb. A numerical algorithm was also designed to express, in the presence of a cam, the rectilinear kinematic variables of the weight stack as a function of the rotational kinematic variables of the resistance input lever, and vice versa. Given that information, one can measure the value of the instantaneous and mean joint power exclusively by means of a linear encoder placed on the weight stack or, alternatively, only by the use of an angular encoder placed on the rotational axis of the resistance lever. The results highlight that, for knee extension exercises with leg extension equipment, the real values of both instantaneous and mean joint power may differ by more than 50% in comparison with the values obtained by taking into account only the mass and velocity of the weight stack. These differences are notable not only in explosive exercises, but also whenever considerable joint velocities/accelerations occur within the range of motion.",[],['Andrea Biscarini']
1,Modern Approaches for Identification of Modified Nucleotides in RNA.,"This review considers approaches for detection of modified monomers in the RNA structure of living organisms. Recently, some data on dynamic alterations in the pool of modifications of the key RNA species that depend on external factors affecting the cells and physiological conditions of the whole organism have been accumulated. The recent studies have presented experimental data on relationship between the mechanisms of formation of modified/minor nucleotides of RNA in mammalian cells and the development of various pathologies. The development of novel methods for detection of chemical modifications of RNA nucleotides in the cells of living organisms and accumulation of knowledge on the contribution of modified monomers to metabolism and functioning of individual RNA species establish the basis for creation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This review includes a short description of routine methods for determination of modified nucleotides in RNA and considers in detail modern approaches that enable not only detection but also quantitative assessment of the modification level of various nucleotides in individual RNA species.",[],"['J A Filippova', 'D V Semenov', 'E S Juravlev', 'A B Komissarov', 'V A Richter', 'G A Stepanov']"
1,An experimental method for detecting blood splatter from retractable phlebotomy and intravascular devices.,"This study was designed to evaluate the safety of retractable intravascular devices in terms of their potential to produce blood splatter. A method for measuring this blood splatter designed by the research team was used to evaluate 3 specific intravascular devices.Scientific filters were positioned around the retraction mechanisms of the devices and weighed with an analytical scale, both before and after activation, in a simulated vein containing mock venous blood. The difference in filter mass was used as the primary unit of analysis to detect blood splatter. In addition, the filters were visually inspected for the presence or absence of blood.A paired t-test revealed significant differences in the prefilter and postfilter groups for 2 of the 3 devices tested (P < .0001). In addition, visible blood was detected on 23% to 40% of the scientific filters for 2 of the devices.Our findings indicate a potential for bloodborne pathogen exposure with the use of intravascular devices with a retractable mechanism. This experiment may serve as a model in the design and implementation of future sharps device evaluation protocols to validate the threat of bloodborne pathogen exposure.",[],"['Donna Haiduven', 'Shawn Applegarth', 'Miloni Shroff']"
1,Development of nanostructured biomedical micro-drug testing device based on in situ cellular activity monitoring.,"Integration of micro and nanofabrication techniques with biotechnology has resulted in the development of in vitro analytical and diagnostic tools for biomedical applications. The focus of such technology has primarily been on therapeutic and sensing applications. The long-term integration of cells with inorganic materials provides the basis for novel sensing platforms. This paper describes the creation of, nanoporous, biocompatible, alumina membranes as a platform for incorporation into a cell based device targeted for in situ recording of cellular electrical activity variations due to the changes associated with the surrounding microenvironments more specifically due to the effect of therapeutic drugs. Studies described herein focus on the interaction of nanoporous alumina substrates embedded in silicon, patterned with cells of interest.

1,Multiplexed lateral flow biosensors: Technological advances for radically improving point-of-care diagnoses.,"Lateral flow biosensors are a leading technology in point-of-care diagnostics due to their simplicity, rapidness and low cost. Their primacy in this arena continues through technological breakthroughs such as multiplexing: the detection of more than one biomarker in a single assay. Multiplexing capacity is critical for improving diagnostic efficiency, enhancing the diagnostic precision for specific diseases and reducing diagnostic cost. Here we review, for the first time, the various types and strategies employed for creating multiplexed lateral flow biosensors. These are classified into four main categories in terms of specific application or multiplexing level, namely linear, parameter, spatial and conceptual. We describe the practical applications and implications for each approach and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Importantly, multiplexing is still subject to limitations of the traditional lateral flow biosensor, such as sensitivity and specificity. However, by pushing the limitations of the traditional medium into the multiplex arena, several technological breakthroughs are emerging with novel solutions that further expand the utility of lateral flow biosensing for point-of-care applications.

1,Microfluidic system for high throughput characterisation of echogenic particles.,"Echogenic particles, such as microbubbles and volatile liquid micro/nano droplets, have shown considerable potential in a variety of clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The accurate prediction of their response to ultrasound excitation is however extremely challenging, and this has hindered the optimisation of techniques such as quantitative ultrasound imaging and targeted drug delivery. Existing characterisation techniques, such as ultra-high speed microscopy provide important insights, but suffer from a number of limitations; most significantly difficulty in obtaining large data sets suitable for statistical analysis and the need to physically constrain the particles, thereby altering their dynamics. Here a microfluidic system is presented that overcomes these challenges to enable the measurement of single echogenic particle response to ultrasound excitation. A co-axial flow focusing device is used to direct a continuous stream of unconstrained particles through the combined focal region of an ultrasound transducer and a laser. Both the optical and acoustic scatter from individual particles are then simultaneously recorded. Calibration of the device and example results for different types of echogenic particle are presented, demonstrating a high throughput of up to 20 particles per second and the ability to resolve changes in particle radius down to 0.1 ??m with an uncertainty of less than 3%.

In the first part of the paper, a historical perspective on the innovation of the stethoscope is used to highlight the transformations in diagnostic practices occasioned by novel diagnostic instruments. In the second part of the paper, ethnographic accounts of contemporary anaesthesia are presented in order to sketch out the manifold variations of using diagnostic instruments in daily practice. Both cases are analysed on a micro-analytical level, emphasising the interrelations of bodies, tools and knowledge in concrete situations. The analysis shows how diagnostic instruments become embodied in the perceptual habits of physicians and how diagnosing becomes an ongoing activity in the course of managing an illness trajectory.",[],['Cornelius Schubert']
1,"Aptamer-functionalized nano/micro-materials for clinical diagnosis: isolation, release and bioanalysis of circulating tumor cells.","Detection of rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood is a challenging, but necessary, task in order to diagnose early onset of metastatic cancer and to monitor treatment efficacy. Over the last decade, step-up produced aptamers have attracted great attention in clinical diagnosis. They have offered great promise for a broader range of cell-specific recognition and isolation. In particular, aptamer-functionalized magnetic particles for selective extraction of target CTCs have shown reduced damage to cells and relatively simple operation. Also, efforts to develop aptamer-functionalized microchannel/microstructures able to efficiently isolate target CTCs are continuing, and these efforts have brought more advanced geometrically designed substrates. Various aptamer-mediated cell release techniques are being developed to enable subsequent biological studies. This article reviews some of these advances in aptamer-functionalized nano/micro-materials for CTCs isolation and methods for releasing captured CTCs from aptamer-functionalized surfaces. Biological studies of CTCs after release are also discussed.",[],"['Yaju Zhao', 'Danke Xu', 'Weihong Tan']"
1,Electrochemical immunosensors for the detection of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein using different carbon nanomaterials-modified electrodes.,"Spinal muscular atrophy is an untreatable potentially fatal hereditary disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the survival motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene which encodes the SMN protein. Currently, definitive diagnosis relies on the demonstration of biallelic pathogenic variants in SMN1 gene. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to accurately quantify SMN protein levels for screening and therapeutic monitoring of symptomatic newborn and SMA patients, respectively. Here, we developed a voltammetric immunosensor for the sensitive detection of SMN protein based on covalently functionalized carbon nanofiber-modified screen printed electrodes. A comparative study of six different carbon nanomaterial-modified electrodes (carbon,??graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO), single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT), multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), and carbon nanofiber (CNF)) was performed. 4-carboxyphenyl layers were covalently grafted on the six electrodes by electroreduction of diazonium salt. Then, the terminal carboxylic moieties on the electrodes surfaces were utilized to immobilize the SMN antibody via EDC/NHS chemistry and to fabricate the immunosensors. The electrochemical characterization and analytical performance of the six immunosensors suggest that carbon nanofiber is a better electrode material for the SMN immunosensor. The voltammetric SMN carbon nanofiber-based immunosensor showed high sensitivity (detection limit of 0.75pg/ml) and selectivity against other proteins such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and dystrophin (DMD). We suggest that this novel biosensor is superior to other developed assays for SMN detection in terms of lower cost, higher sensitivity, simplicity and capability of high throughput screening.","['Carbon nanofiber', 'Immunosensor', 'Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)', 'Survival motor neuron (SMN)']","['Shimaa Eissa', 'Nawal Alshehri', 'Anas M Abdel Rahman', 'Majed Dasouki', 'Khalid M Abu-Salah', 'Mohammed Zourob']"

The results obtained show a very close agreement between the OPTI system and the comparison methods for all parameters tested: hemoglobin (y=1.00x-0.2 g/l, r=0.997, n=81), sodium (y=1.13x-18.7 mmol/l, r=0.951, n=79), potassium (y=1.03x-0.04 mmol/l, r=0.972, n=79), pH (y=1.03x-0.29, r=0.958, n=57), pCO2 (y=1.03x-1.14 mm Hg, r=0.988, n=57) and pO2 (y=1.07x-0.85 mm Hg, r=0.995, n=57). The coefficients of variation for the within-run imprecision were below 1.1% for sodium and hemoglobin, and below 2.6% for all other parameters, except for pCO(2) with coefficients of variation up to 3.6% at low calibration gas concentrations. Due to this analytical performance and its portability, the OPTI system is well suited for low to medium test frequencies and immediate use in emergency rooms, intensive care or surgery units.",[],"['H Schlebusch', 'I Paffenholz', 'R Zerback', 'R Leinberger']"

However, a conventionally used method of fabricating MPs, emulsion polymerization, has a limitation in achieving the aforementioned characteristics and several approaches such as the microfluidics-assisted (droplet-based microfluidics and flow lithography-based microfluidics), electrohydrodynamics (EHD)-based, centrifugation-based, and template-based methods have been recently suggested to overcome this limitation. The outstanding features of complex MPs engineered through these suggested methods have provided new opportunities for MPs to be applied in a wider range of applications including cell carriers, drug delivery agents, active pigments for display, microsensors, interface stabilizers, and catalyst substrates. Overall, the engineered MPs expose their potential particularly in the field of biomedical engineering as the increased complexity in the engineered MPs fulfills well the requirements of the high-end applications.

However, there is no in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) angiogenesis assay that can provide uniform culture conditions for the quantitative assessment of physiological responses to chemoattractant reagents under various concentrations of anti-angiogenesis drugs.

They were clinically and radiologically assessed, and a survival analysis of the implant was performed.Statistically significant differences were identified in the pre- and post-operative values, according to Harris and Merle D??Aubigne scores. The femoral components survival was considered as an endpoint of the revision replacement, which was 84% at a mean of 13 years. There were 9 intraoperative complications (6 were fractures) and they significantly affected the length of hospital stay. No post-operative complications were observed in 70% of the patients. None of the analysed variables had any influence on the radiological subsidence of the femoral component.Several techniques aim to solve the bone stock deficiency in revision total hip arthroplasty, but only impaction grafting attempts to recover it.The Ling's technique shows an improvement over the Merle D??Aubigne and Harris scores, in the medium-long term. The intraoperative complications are mainly an increase in the length of hospital stay and the number of days needed to be able to sit down.

1,Innovations in hip arthroplasty three-dimensional modeling and analytical technology (SOMA).,"The modern generations of cementless hip arthroplasty implant designs are based on precise fit and fill of components within the native bony geometry of the proximal femur and the acetabulum for enhanced implant longevity. Variations exist based on a number of population demographics such as age, gender, body mass index, and ethnicity. Recently, establishment of comprehensive electronic computerized tomographic databases from a diverse population worldwide have been key innovations in the field of implant development. This technology provides a potential improvement compared to historical techniques of implant design and manufacturing which involved limited trials on cadavers. Segmentation of the computerized data to generate three-dimensional models allows precise and accurate measurements of anatomical structures and may provide better understanding of anthropometric variations that occur among individuals. Evidence-and population-based computational analyses may provide a better tool for designing orthopaedic implants that deliver an enhanced fit for a more diverse patient population. Moreover, these population-based databases can also verify new designs by means of virtual implantation and analysis on specific or large groups of bones within the database. The aim of this paper is to describe a three dimensional modeling and analytical technology and to review the various applications of this technology in relation to hip arthroplasty.

1,Nanosensors for regenerative medicine.,"Assessing biodistribution, fate, and function of implanted therapeutic cells in preclinical animal experiments is critical to realize safe, effective and efficient treatments for subsequent implementation within the clinic. Currently, tissue histology, the most prevalent analytical technique to meet this need, is limited by end-point analysis, high cost and long preparation time. Moreover, it is disadvantaged by an inability to monitor in real-time, qualitative interpretation and ethical issues arising from animal sacrifice. While genetic engineering techniques allow cells to express molecules with detectable signals (e.g., fluorescence, luminescence, T1 (spin-lattice)/T2 (spin-spin) contrast in magnetic resonance imaging, radionuclide), concerns arise regarding technical complexity, high-cost of genetic manipulation, as well as mutagenic cell dysfunction. Alternatively, cells can be labeled using nanoparticle-sensors-nanosensors that emit signals to identify cell location, status and function in a simple, cost-effective, and non-genetic manner. This review article provides the definition, classification, evolution, and applications of nanosensor technology and focuses on how they can be utilized in regenerative medicine.

1,Pressure recording analytical method and bioreactance for stroke volume index monitoring during pediatric cardiac surgery.,"It is currently uncertain which hemodynamic monitoring device reliably measures stroke volume and tracks cardiac output changes in pediatric cardiac surgery patients.To evaluate the difference between stroke volume index (SVI) measured by pressure recording analytical method (PRAM) and bioreactance and their ability to track changes after a therapeutic intervention.A single-center prospective observational cohort study in children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was conducted. Twenty children below 20 kg with median (interquartile range) weight of 5.3 kg (4.1-7.8) and age of 6 months (3-20) were enrolled. Data were collected after anesthesia induction, at the end of CPB, before fluid administration and after fluid administration. Overall, median-IQR PRAM SVI values (23 ml??m(-2), 19-27) were significantly higher than bioreactance SVI (15 ml??m(-2), 12-25, P = 0.0001). Correlation (r(2) ) between the two methods was 0.15 (P = 0.0003).

The standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI has a typical delay of two to three days. In the absence of definitive microbiological diagnosis at the point of care, physicians frequently initiate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, and this has contributed to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Biosensors are emerging as a powerful diagnostic platform for infectious diseases. Paralleling how blood glucose sensors revolutionized the management of diabetes, and how pregnancy tests are now conducted in the home, biosensors are poised to improve UTI diagnosis significantly.

1,Analytical description of dose profile behaviour in Gamma Knife radiosurgery.,"Stereotactic Gamma Knife radiosurgery utilizes ionizing beams from (60)Co sources and relies on a combination of collimator sizes, weighting, etc to generate a high-dose region that is conformal with a designated target volume. Dose computation is typically performed by computer, but in this paper, single collimator dose profile behaviour is modelled analytically and then extended to accommodate multiple collimators of different weights with co-located isocentres. The dose profile from a single helmet is derived from a top-hat beam profile approximation and an idealized symmetric distribution of sources is used to represent the 201 sources within a collimating helmet. The results from the analysis are validated by an independent numerical model and also compared with those obtained by other groups using numerical and experimental methods. With respect to multiple collimators, the relationship between the size (full width half maximum) of the irradiated volume and relative collimator weighting is also examined using the simple analytical model. The simplicity of the mathematics clarifies the relationship between beam profile, dose profile and multiple collimator behaviour, and provides data that compare favourably with published literature.",[],"['J Fenner', 'M Gwilliam', 'R Mehrem', 'A Bird', 'L Walton']"

The success of such biomarkers would have a huge impact on how we improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients and alleviate the financial burden of healthcare systems. In the past, the genomics community (mostly through large-scale, deep genomic sequencing technologies) has been steadily improving our understanding of the molecular basis of disease, with a number of biomarker panels already authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use (e.g., MammaPrint, two recently cleared devices using next-generation sequencing platforms to detect DNA changes in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene).

1,Dynamic response of liquid-filled catheter systems for measurement of blood pressure: precision of measurements and reliability of the Pressure Recording Analytical Method with different disposable systems.,"We aimed to compare the effects of a blood pressure transducer system specifically manufactured to limit underdamping artifacts with those of a standard system on hemodynamic parameter estimation and accuracy.Forty-three consecutive patients undergoing vascular surgery at the University of Florence, Italy, were included. Arterial blood pressure signal was simultaneously registered with 2 MostCare monitors, connected to the artery either by a standard transducer or a specific transducer manufactured to avoid underdamping artifacts (Resonance Over-Shoot Eliminator [R.O.S.E.]; Becton Dickinson, Becton Drive, NJ). Patients were divided into 2 groups: absence (C group) or presence (R group) of underdamping/resonance artifacts of blood pressure signal. Systolic blood pressure, cardiac index, maximal pressure/time ratio (dP/dt(MAX)), and cardiac cycle efficiency were recorded every 30 seconds for 30 minutes. A total of 2675 measurements were performed with 34.9% incidence of underdamping/resonance artifacts.All hemodynamic parameters showed clinically acceptable differences in the C group; in contrast, the results differed greatly in the R group between standard and R.O.S.E. transducer (systolic blood pressure bias, 16.7 mm Hg; cardiac index bias, 0.24 L min(-1) m(-2); dP/dt(MAX) bias, 0.92 mm Hg/ms; cardiac cycle efficiency bias, 0.018 units).Underdamping/resonance artifacts frequently affect blood pressure measurement in operating rooms and intensive care units and cause severe overestimation of systolic blood pressure and incorrect estimation of hemodynamic parameters when the pulse contour method is used.",[],"['Stefano Romagnoli', 'Salvatore Mario Romano', 'Sergio Bevilacqua', 'Chiara Lazzeri', 'Gian Franco Gensini', 'Carlo Pratesi', 'Diego Quattrone', 'Daniele Dini', 'Angelo Raffaele De Gaudio']"
1,Differential solubility of curcuminoids in serum and albumin solutions: implications for analytical and therapeutic applications.,"Commercially available curcumin preparations contain a mixture of related polyphenols, collectively referred to as curcuminoids. These encompass the primary component curcumin along with its co-purified derivatives demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Curcuminoids have numerous biological activities, including inhibition of cancer related cell proliferation and reduction of amyloid plaque formation associated with Alzheimer disease. Unfortunately, the solubility of curcuminoids in aqueous solutions is exceedingly low. This restricts their systemic availability in orally administered formulations and limits their therapeutic potential.Methods are described that achieve high concentrations of soluble curcuminoids in serum. Solid curcuminoids were either mixed directly with serum, or they were predissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added as aliquots to serum. Both methods resulted in high levels of curcuminoid-solubility in mammalian sera from different species. However, adding aliquots of dimethyl sulfoxide-dissolved curcuminoids to serum proved to be more efficient, producing soluble curcuminoid concentrations of at least 3 mM in human serum. The methods also resulted in the differential solubility of individual curcuminoids in serum. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide-dissolved curcuminoids to serum preferentially solubilized curcumin, whereas adding solid curcuminoids predominantly solubilized bisdemethoxycurcumin. Either method of solubilization was equally effective in inhibiting dose-dependent HeLa cell proliferation in culture. The maximum concentration of curcuminoids achieved in serum was at least 100-fold higher than that required for inhibiting cell proliferation in culture and 1000-fold higher than the concentration that has been reported to prevent amyloid plaque formation associated with Alzheimer disease. Curcuminoids were also highly soluble in solutions of purified albumin, a major component of serum.These results suggest the possibility of alternative therapeutic approaches by injection or infusion of relatively small amounts of curcuminoid-enriched serum. They also provide tools to reproducibly solubilize curcuminoids for analysis in cell culture applications. The differential solubility of curcuminoids achieved by different methods of solubilization offers convenient alternatives to assess the diverse biological effects contributed by curcumin and its derivatives.",[],['Wolfgang W Quitschke']
1,New ionization methods and miniature mass spectrometers for biomedicine: DESI imaging for cancer diagnostics and paper spray ionization for therapeutic drug monitoring.,"The state-of-the-art in two new ambient ionization methods for mass spectrometry, desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and paper spray (PS), is described and their utility is illustrated with new studies on tissue imaging and biofluid analysis. DESI is an ambient ionization method that can be performed on untreated histological sections of biological tissue in the open lab environment to image lipids, fatty acids, hormones and other compounds. Paper spray is performed in the open lab too; it involves electrospraying dry blood spots or biofluid deposits from a porous medium. PS is characterized by extreme simplicity and speed: a spot of whole blood or other biofluid is analyzed directly from paper, simply by applying a high voltage to the moist paper. Both methods are being developed for use in diagnostics as a means to inform therapy. DESI imaging is applied to create molecular maps of tissue sections without prior labeling or other sample preparation. Like other methods of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), it combines the chemical speciation of multiple analytes with information on spatial distributions. DESI imaging provides valuable information which correlates with the disease state of tissue as determined by standard histochemical methods. Positive-ion data are presented which complement previously reported negative-ion data on paired human bladder cancerous and adjacent normal tissue sections from 20 patients. These data add to the evidence already in the literature demonstrating that differences in the distributions of particular lipids contain disease-diagnostic information. Multivariate statistical analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) is used to analyze the imaging MS data, and so confirm differences between the lipid profiles of diseased and healthy tissue types. As more such data is acquired, DESI imaging has the potential to be a diagnostic tool for future cancer detection in situ; this suggests a potential role in guiding therapy in parallel with standard histochemical and immunohistological methods. The PS methodology is aimed at high-throughput clinical measurement of quantitative levels of particular therapeutic agents in blood and other biofluids. The experiment allows individual drugs to be quantified at therapeutic levels and data is presented showing quantitative drug analysis from mixtures of therapeutic drugs in whole blood. Data on cholesterol sulfate, a new possible prostate biomarker seen at elevated levels in diseased prostate tissue, but not in healthy prostate tissue in serum are reported using paper spray ionization.",[],"['R Graham Cooks', 'Nicholas E Manicke', 'Allison L Dill', 'Demian R Ifa', 'Livia S Eberlin', 'Anthony B Costa', 'He Wang', 'Guangming Huang', 'Zheng Ouyang']"
1,Recommended Best Practices for Process Monitoring Instrumentation in Pharmaceutical Freeze Drying-2017.,"Recommended best practices in monitoring of product status during pharmaceutical freeze drying are presented, focusing on methods that apply to both laboratory and production scale. With respect to product temperature measurement, sources of uncertainty associated with any type of measurement probe are discussed, as well as important differences between the two most common types of temperature-measuring instruments-thermocouples and resistance temperature detectors (RTD). Two types of pressure transducers are discussed-thermal conductivity-type gauges and capacitance manometers, with the Pirani gauge being the thermal conductivity-type gauge of choice. It is recommended that both types of pressure gauge be used on both the product chamber and the condenser for freeze dryers with an external condenser, and the reasoning for this recommendation is discussed. Developing technology for process monitoring worthy of further investigation is also briefly reviewed, including wireless product temperature monitoring, tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy at manufacturing scale, heat flux measurement, and mass spectrometry as process monitoring tools.","['heat flux measurement', 'mass spectrometry', 'pressure measurement', 'process analytical technology', 'temperature measurement', 'tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy']","['Steven Nail', 'Serguei Tchessalov', 'Evgenyi Shalaev', 'Arnab Ganguly', 'Ernesto Renzi', 'Frank Dimarco', 'Lindsay Wegiel', 'Steven Ferris', 'William Kessler', 'Michael Pikal', 'Greg Sacha', 'Alina Alexeenko', 'T N Thompson', 'Cindy Reiter', 'James Searles', 'Paul Coiteux']"
1,Addressing new analytical challenges in protein formulation development.,"As the share of therapeutic proteins in the arsenal of modern medicine continue increasing, relatively little progress has been made in the development of analytical methods that would address specific needs encountered during the development of these new drugs. Consequently, the researchers resort to adaptation of existing instrumentation to meet the demands of rigorous bioprocess and formulation development. In this report, we present a number of such adaptations as well as new instruments that allow efficient and precise measurement of critical parameters throughout the development stage. The techniques include use of atomic force microscopy to visualize proteinacious sub-visible particles, use of extrinsic fluorescent dyes to visualize protein aggregates, particle tracking analysis, determination of the concentration of monoclonal antibodies by the analysis of second-derivative UV spectra, flow cytometry for the determination of subvisible particle counts, high-throughput fluorescence spectroscopy to study phase separation phenomena, an adaptation of a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system for the measurement of solution viscosity and a variable-speed streamlined analytical ultracentrifugation method. An ex vivo model for understanding the factors that affect bioavailability after subcutaneous injections is also described. Most of these approaches allow not only a more precise insight into the nature of the formulated proteins, but also offer increased throughput while minimizing sample requirements.",[],"['Henryk Mach', 'Tudor Arvinte']"
1,Femtomolar detection of cardiac troponin I using a novel label-free and reagent-free dendrimer enhanced impedimetric immunosensor.,"A novel highly sensitive dendrimer coupled impedimetric immunosensor was developed for the label-free and reagent-free detection of cardiac troponin I (TnI) in serum samples. The immunosensor probe was fabricated by covalently attaching carboxylic acid-functionalized third generation (G3) poly (amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer (Den) on the 3, 3', 5, 5'-tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) modified 6-mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on a gold (Au) electrode. Monoclonal anti-TnI antibody was then covalently immobilized on the Den and TMB attached MHA SAM modified surface. TMB was used as an internal surface redox couple for generating signal which also allowed to avoid the use of an external one (i.e. ferricyanide couple) in solution during the impedance measurement for monitoring the antibody-antigen binding. On the other hand, Den was used as a signal enhancer by immobilizing more anti-body on the immunosensor probe. The immunosensor probe was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The TnI detection in diluted serum was based on the measurement of charge transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>) of the electron transfer process of the surface-attached TMB before and after immunobinding. Under the optimized condition, the proposed immunosensor could detect human TnI in diluted serum samples as low as 11.7 fM with a wide linear dynamic range, good stability, and excellent specificity. The validity of the proposed method was tested in various TnI spiked human undiluted serum samples and was compared with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results suggested that the proposed immunosensor could be a useful tool for practical applications in clinical diagnosis.","['Cardiac troponin I', 'Dendrimer, 3, 3?€?, 5, 5?€?-Tetramethylbenzidine', 'Human serum', 'Impedimetric immunosensor', 'Protein biomarkers']","['Rashida Akter', 'Bongjin Jeong', 'Yong-Mi Lee', 'Jong-Soon Choi', 'Md Aminur Rahman']"
1,"Analytical Performance Requirements for Systems for Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose With Focus on System Accuracy: Relevant Differences Among ISO 15197:2003, ISO 15197:2013, and Current FDA Recommendations.","In the European Union (EU), the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 15197 standard is applicable for the evaluation of systems for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) before the market approval. In 2013, a revised version of this standard was published. Relevant revisions in the analytical performance requirements are the inclusion of the evaluation of influence quantities, for example, hematocrit, and some changes in the testing procedures for measurement precision and system accuracy evaluation, for example, number of test strip lots. Regarding system accuracy evaluation, the most important change is the inclusion of more stringent accuracy criteria. In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States published their own guidance document for the premarket evaluation of SMBG systems with even more stringent system accuracy criteria than stipulated by ISO 15197:2013. The establishment of strict accuracy criteria applicable for the premarket evaluation is a possible approach to further improve the measurement quality of SMBG systems. However, the system accuracy testing procedure is quite complex, and some critical aspects, for example, systematic measurement difference between the reference measurement procedure and a higher-order procedure, may potentially limit the apparent accuracy of a given system. Therefore, the implementation of a harmonized reference measurement procedure for which traceability to standards of higher order is verified through an unbroken, documented chain of calibrations is desirable. In addition, the establishment of regular and standardized post-marketing evaluations of distributed test strip lots should be considered as an approach toward an improved measurement quality of available SMBG systems.

1,Computational modeling and fluorescence microscopy characterization of a two-phase magnetophoretic microsystem for continuous-flow blood detoxification.,"Magnetic beads can be functionalized to capture and separate target pathogens from blood for extracorporeal detoxification. The beads can be magnetically separated from a blood stream and collected into a coflowing buffer solution using a two-phase liquid-liquid continuous-flow microfluidic device in the presence of an external field. However, device design and process optimization, i.e. high bead recovery with minimum blood loss or dilution remain a substantial technological challenge. We introduce a CFD-based Eulerian-Lagrangian computational model that enables the rational design and optimization of such systems. The model takes into account dominant magnetic and hydrodynamic forces on the beads as well as coupled bead-fluid interactions. Fluid flow (Navier-Stokes equations) and mass transfer (Fick's law) between the coflowing fluids are solved numerically, while the magnetic force on the beads is predicted using analytical methods. The model is demonstrated via application to a prototype device and used to predict key performance metrics; degree of bead separation, flow patterns, and mass transfer, i.e. blood diffusion to the buffer phase. The impact of different process variables and parameters - flow rates, bead and magnet dimensions and fluid viscosities - on both bead recovery and blood loss or dilution is quantified for the first time. The performance of the prototype device is characterized using fluorescence microscopy and the experimental results are found to match theoretical predictions within an absolute error of 15%. While the model is demonstrated here for analysis of a detoxification device, it can be readily adapted to a broad range of magnetically-enabled microfluidic applications, e.g. bioseparation, sorting and sensing.",[],"['Jenifer G??mez-Pastora', 'Cristina Gonz??lez-Fern??ndez', 'Eusebio Real', 'Alexander Iles', 'Eugenio Bringas', 'Edward P Furlani', 'Inmaculada Ortiz']"
1,A modular segmented-flow platform for 3D cell cultivation.,"In vitro 3D cell cultivation is promised to equate tissue in vivo more realistically than 2D cell cultivation corresponding to cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Therefore, a scalable 3D cultivation platform was developed. This platform, called pipe-based bioreactors (pbb), is based on the segmented-flow technology: aqueous droplets are embedded in a water-immiscible carrier fluid. The droplet volumes range from 60 nL to 20 ??L and are used as bioreactors lined up in a tubing like pearls on a string. The modular automated platform basically consists of several modules like a fluid management for a high throughput droplet generation for self-assembly or scaffold-based 3D cell cultivation, a storage module for incubation and storage, and an analysis module for monitoring cell aggregation and proliferation basing on microscopy or photometry. In this report, the self-assembly of murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to uniformly sized embryoid bodies (EBs), the cell proliferation, the cell viability as well as the influence on the cell differentiation to cardiomyocytes are described. The integration of a dosage module for medium exchange or agent addition will enable pbb as long-term 3D cell cultivation system for studying stem cell differentiation, e.g. cardiac myogenesis or for diagnostic and therapeutic testing in personalized medicine.","['Automated modular platform', 'Droplets', 'Embryoid body formation', 'High(er) throughput', 'Long-term 3D cell cultivation']","['Karen Lemke', 'Tobias F??rster', 'Robert R??mer', 'Mandy Quade', 'Stefan Wiedemeier', 'Andreas Grodrian', 'Gunter Gastrock']"
2,Historical aspects of Mexican psychiatry.,"Mexican psychiatry initiated since pre-Hispanic times. Historically, treatments were a mixture of magic, science and religion. Ancient Nahuas had their own medical concepts with a holistic view of medicine, considering men and cosmos as a whole. The first psychiatric hospital appeared in 1566 and a more modern psychiatric asylum emerged until 1910. International exchanges of theoretical approaches started in the National University with the visit of Pierre Janet. There were other important figures that influenced Mexican psychiatry, such as Erich Fromm, Henri Ey, Jean Garrab?? and Yves Thoret. Regarding Mexican psychiatrists, some of the most important contributors to Mexican psychiatry were Jos?? Luis Pati??o Rojas, Manuel Guevara Oropeza and Ram??n de la Fuente Mu??iz. This article includes excerpts from ""Clinical Psychiatry"", a book by Pati??o Rojas where he tries to understand and describe the inner world experienced by patients with schizophrenia; also, the thesis conducted by Guevara Oropeza (""Psychoanalisis""), which is a critical comparison between the theories of Janet and Freud. Finally, we include ""The study of consciousness: current status"" by Ram??n de la Fuente, which leads us through the initial investigations concerning consciousness, its evolution, and the contributions made by psychology, philosophy and neurobiology.","['Mexico', 'consciousness', 'history', 'psychiatry', 'psychoanalysis']",['Sergio Javier Villase??or Bayardo']

A rapprochement between psychiatry and religion has been predicated on their overlapping goals to promote individual and community resilience, growth, and well-being. Due to progress in post-secular dialogue, psychiatry, religion and spiritual disciplines have the historical opportunity to shape the future of individual, public and global mental health as well as building compassionate society and empathic civilization.",[],['Miro Jakovljevic']
2,Factors Influencing Medical School Graduates Toward a Career in Psychiatry: Analysis from the 2011-2013 Association of American Medical Colleges Graduation Questionnaire.,"Various factors influence choice of medical specialty. Previous research grouped specialties into controllable lifestyle, primary care, and surgical. This study compared factors influencing individuals to choose psychiatry versus other specialties.Data came from the 2011-2013 Association of American Medical Colleges Graduation Questionnaire. The authors grouped responses, ranging from no influence to minor, moderate, and strong influence, into psychiatry and controllable lifestyle, primary care, and surgical specialties and analyzed the data using one-way analysis of variance.The analyses included 29,227 students, of which 1329 (4.5%) elected psychiatry; 10,998 (37.6%), controllable lifestyle specialties; 12,320 (42.2%), primary care specialties; and 4580 (15.7%), surgical specialties. Students choosing psychiatry reported less influence of competitiveness, student debt, and salary expectations than those choosing controllable lifestyle and surgical specialties (p?€?<?€?0.0001) and more influence of work/life balance than those choosing primary care and surgical specialties (p?€?<?€?0.0001). They reported less influence of family expectations than those choosing controllable lifestyle specialties (p?€?<?€?0.0001). They reported more influence of fit with personality than controllable lifestyle, primary care, and surgical specialties (p?€?<?€?0.004).Students entering psychiatry do not fit the traditional categories of controllable lifestyle, primary care, and surgical profiles, but fall between controllable lifestyle and primary care specialties. Recruitment efforts may need to address this different pattern of influences.","['Medical students?€? career choice', 'Residency recruitment']","['Lindsey Wilbanks', 'John Spollen', 'Erick Messias']"
2,Cyclical swings: The b??te noire of psychiatry.,"Progress in psychiatry in the West has been retarded by the proclivity of the discipline to swing violently between 2 approaches to viewing mental illness; that is, emphasizing-to the exclusion of the other-the material-somatic vs the psychical-experiential avenues to knowledge. Each time a shift occurs, the leaders of the new dominant approach emotionally denounce the principles and ideas that came before. We can examine this phenomenon historically by looking at Romantic psychiatry, mid-/late-19th century empirical psychiatry, psychoanalysis, and modern biological psychiatry. Looking at the 2 approaches in treatment today, the gold standard of patient care involves combining empirical/psychological care in 1 person (the psychiatrist) or shared between 2 clinicians working intimately with each other (psychiatrist with psychologist or social worker.) Yet as regards psychiatrists, they are discouraged from paying full attention to the psychological side by the way managed care and third-party payment have combined to remunerate them. Finally, how do we account for the intense swings and denunciations in psychiatry? The author speculates on possible explanations but leaves the question open for her readers.",[],['Hannah S Decker']
2,"Adherence to behavioral therapy and psychiatry visits in a safety-net setting in Virginia, USA.","Little is known about predictors of adherence to outpatient behavioural therapy and psychiatry visits in those who experience homelessness. Yet, consistent receipt of services in the community is critical to preventing use of acute care psychiatric services, which cause a significant cost burden to the mental health system. This retrospective study examined sociodemographic, housing instability and health-related factors associated with adherence to behavioural therapy and psychiatry appointments among 1711 clients served by an urban healthcare for the homeless centre in Virginia, USA. Clients ???18??years old with a behavioural health condition who had an intake assessment and at least one behavioural therapy or psychiatry appointment scheduled during October 2005-September 2009 were eligible for the study. Of those with scheduled behavioural therapy visits, 27.7% were high adherers and 19.3% did not attend any appointments, whereas of those with scheduled psychiatry visits, 13.6% were high adherers and 22.1% did not attend any appointments. African Americans, when compared with whites, and those with a primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder were less likely to be high adherers to behavioural therapy. Women and being ???35??years old were associated with a decreased likelihood of failing to attend psychiatry appointments, whereas African Americans, when compared with whites, and those with co-occurring disorders were more likely to not attend any psychiatry appointments. Understanding factors related to adherence to behavioural health services can help homeless care providers tailor strategies for improving visit adherence.

2,Karl Jaspers: The Icon of Modern Psychiatry.,"December 2015 and March 2016 issues of the American Journal of Psychiatry contain a debate focusing on the legacy of Emil Kraepelin, widely considered one of the founders if not the iconic founder of modern scientific psychiatry. The authors, Eric J. Engstrom and Kenneth S. Kendler, challenge the so-called neo-Kraepelinian view of Kraepelin and argue that the true, historical Kraepelin was far more inclined towards scientific psychology, less reductionist and brain-centric, and more skeptical nosologically than his later followers apparently believe. Commenting upon this paper, Rael D. Strous, Annette A. Opler, and Lewis A. Opler do not question these claims per se, but rather recall and emphasize historical facts that the paper regrettably omitted: Kraepelin's avid promotion of degeneration theory, eugenics, racism, and anti-Semitism as well as his mentoring of several of the most prominent Nazi-collaborating psychiatrists. Strous, Opler and Opler go on to suggest that it is now time for psychiatry to unburden itself of any iconic indebtedness to Kraepelin. The authors of the current paper agree, and propose to replace Kraepelin with the psychiatrist Karl Jaspers, MD (1883-1969) as the proper iconic founder of present-day and future psychiatry. Acknowledging our debt to Jaspers can usher in a fully humanistic and scientific psychiatric practice that can flourish as a medical discipline that is respectful of and of service to patients, beneficial for research, multiperspectival and methodologically pluralistic.",[],"['Michael A Schwartz', 'Marcin Moskalewicz', 'Osborne P Wiggins']"
2,Realising stratified psychiatry using multidimensional signatures and trajectories.,"Stratified or personalised medicine targets treatments for groups of individuals with a disorder based on individual heterogeneity and shared factors that influence the likelihood of response. Psychiatry has traditionally defined diagnoses by constellations of co-occurring signs and symptoms that are assigned a categorical label (e.g. schizophrenia). Trial methodology in psychiatry has evaluated interventions targeted at these categorical entities, with diagnoses being equated to disorders. Recent insights into both the nosology and neurobiology of psychiatric disorder reveal that traditional categorical diagnoses cannot be equated with disorders. We argue that current quantitative methodology (1) inherits these categorical assumptions, (2) allows only for the discovery of average treatment response, (3) relies on composite outcome measures and (4) sacrifices valuable predictive information for stratified and personalised treatment in psychiatry.To achieve a truly 'stratified psychiatry' we propose and then operationalise two necessary steps: first, a formal multi-dimensional representation of disorder definition and clinical state, and second, the similar redefinition of outcomes as multidimensional constructs that can expose within- and between-patient differences in response. We use the categorical diagnosis of schizophrenia-conceptualised as a label for heterogeneous disorders-as a means of introducing operational definitions of stratified psychiatry using principles from multivariate analysis. We demonstrate this framework by application to the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness dataset, showing heterogeneity in both patient clinical states and their trajectories after treatment that are lost in the traditional categorical approach with composite outcomes. We then systematically review a decade of registered clinical trials for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia highlighting existing assumptions of categorical diagnoses and aggregate outcomes while identifying a small number of trials that could be reanalysed using our proposal.We describe quantitative methods for the development of a multi-dimensional model of clinical state, disorders and trajectories which practically realises stratified psychiatry. We highlight the potential for recovering existing trial data, the implications for stratified psychiatry in trial design and clinical treatment and finally, describe different kinds of probabilistic reasoning tools necessary to implement stratification.","['Methodology', 'Multivariate', 'Stratified psychiatry', 'Trials']","['Dan W Joyce', 'Angie A Kehagia', 'Derek K Tracy', 'Jessica Proctor', 'Sukhwinder S Shergill']"
2,The impact of the educational environment on career choice and attitudes toward psychiatry.,"The educational environment may influence students' attitudes towards medical specialties, which in turn can affect specialty career choices. The present study sought to establish if perceptions of the educational environment in a psychiatry rotation influenced attitudinal changes towards psychiatry in medical students and impacts decisions about psychiatry as a career choice.The modified Attitudes to Psychiatry Scale, Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure, and questions specific to career choice in psychiatry were administered to 100 undergraduates in a psychiatry rotation.Significant improvements in attitudes toward psychiatry were highly correlated with the educational environment, particularly when it was perceived as providing inspiration and enabling students to recognize the merits of psychiatry and the effectiveness of treatment. However, there was a worsening trend in the stigma to psychiatry in the posting, and only the positive attitudinal change (but not educational environment) influenced a career choice in psychiatry.While the educational environment contributes towards positive attitudinal changes in a specialty rotation, stigma of psychiatry continues to be a limiting factor, which is, unfortunately, not clearly addressed in the curriculum. The findings support the urgent need for interventions in this area.",[],"['Rathi Mahendran', 'Haikel A Lim', 'Swapna Verma', 'Ee Heok Kua']"
2,Parents in adult psychiatric care and their children: a call for more interagency collaboration with social services and child and adolescent psychiatry.,"A parental mental illness affects all family members and should warrant a need for support.To investigate the extent to which psychiatric patients with underage children are the recipients of child-focused interventions and involved in interagency collaboration.Data were retrieved from a psychiatric services medical record database consisting of data regarding 29,972 individuals in southern Sweden and indicating the patients' main diagnoses, comorbidity, children below the age of 18, and child-focused interventions.Among the patients surveyed, 12.9% had registered underage children. One-fourth of the patients received child-focused interventions from adult psychiatry, and out of these 30.7% were involved in interagency collaboration as compared to 7.7% without child-focused interventions. Overall, collaboration with child and adolescent psychiatric services was low for all main diagnoses. If a patient received child-focused interventions from psychiatric services, the likelihood of being involved in interagency collaboration was five times greater as compared to patients receiving no child-focused intervention when controlled for gender, main diagnosis, and inpatient care.Psychiatric services play a significant role in identifying the need for and initiating child-focused interventions in families with a parental mental illness, and need to develop and support strategies to enhance interagency collaboration with other welfare services.","['Parental mental illness', 'child-focused intervention', 'children', 'interagency collaboration', 'psychiatric services']","['Maria Afzelius', 'Margareta ??stman', 'Maria R??stam', 'Gisela Priebe']"

To this end, the limitations of current statistical paradigms in mental health research are critiqued, and an introduction is provided to critical machine learning methods used in clinical studies. A selective literature review is then presented aiming to reinforce the usefulness of machine learning methods and provide evidence of their potential. In the context of promising initial results, the current limitations of machine learning approaches are addressed, and considerations for future clinical translation are outlined.","['artificial intelligence', 'clinical psychology', 'machine learning', 'mental health', 'personalized medicine', 'psychiatry', 'translational psychiatry']","['Dominic B Dwyer', 'Peter Falkai', 'Nikolaos Koutsouleris']"

He proposes that the case of the woman corresponds to a brain disease, opposing the thought of an ovarian and uterine origin.

2,Attitudes and Confidence in the Integration of Psychiatry Scale.,"The authors sought to measure attitudes and confidence in the integration of psychiatry into other fields of medicine.The Attitudes and Confidence in Integration of Psychiatry in Medicine (ACIP) scale was developed through discussion with content experts across disciplines and pilot testing of items and administered to third- and fourth-year medical students at University of Iowa, University of Michigan, Rush University for validation, focused on assessment of variability, internal consistency, factor structure, and test-retest reliability.A total of 310 medical students completed the survey (35% participation rate). The scale had a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha?€?=?€?0.88) and was without ceiling or floor effects. Students rated the integration of psychiatry into the practice of surgery and its subspecialties as less relevant than its integration into other specialties; however, scores were not biased by students' interest in procedural vs. non-procedural specialties. Test-retest reliability was high (Cronbach's alpha?€?=?€?0.90).The ACIP may serve a useful role in determining the outcome of educational efforts toward integrated care.","['Attitudes', 'Medical education', 'Medical students', 'Psychiatry', 'Questionnaires']","['Jess G Fiedorowicz', 'Bezalel Dantz', 'Mary C Blazek']"
2,Training in psychiatry throughout Europe.,"Psychiatry is the largest medical specialty in Europe. Despite efforts to bring harmonisation, training in psychiatry in Europe continues to be very diverse. The Union Europ??enne des M??decins Sp??cialistes??(UEMS) has issued as from 2000 a charter of requirements for the training in psychiatry with an additional European Framework for Competencies in Psychiatry in 2009. Yet these have not been implemented throughout Europe. In this paper, the diversity in training throughout Europe is approached from different angles: the cultural differences between countries with regards to how mental health care is considered and founded on, the cultural differences between people throughout Europe in all states. The position of psychotherapy is emphasised. What once was the cornerstone of psychiatry as medical specialty seems to have become a neglected area. Seeing the patient with mental health problems within his cultural context is important, but considering him within his family context. The purpose of any training is enabling the trainee to gain the knowledge and acquire the competencies necessary to become a well-equipped professional is the subject of the last paragraph in which trainees consider their position and early career psychiatrists look back to see whether what they were trained in matches with what they need in the working situation. Common standard for training and certification are a necessity within Europe, for the benefit of the profession of psychiatrist but also for patient safety. UEMS is advised to join forces with the Council of National Psychiatric Associations (NPAs) within the EPA and trainings and early career psychiatrist, to discuss with the users what standards should be implemented in all European countries and how a European board examination could ensure professional quality of psychiatrists throughout the continent.

2,Psychiatry and psychology in medieval Persia.,"The history of psychological sciences and especially the ways in which related disorders were treated in medieval Persia are not well known in the West. The main objective of this article is to review the clinical approaches to psychological disorders used by practitioners in medieval Persia.Several documents still exist from which the clinical data on different psychological syndromes in medieval Persia can be ascertained. Data for this review were identified by searches of MEDLINE, Current Contents, the Internet, references from relevant articles and books, the Astan-e-Ghods Razavi Library, the Tehran University Library, the Mashhad University Library, and the files of the authors. Search terms included psychiatry, psychology, Persian, medieval, Avicenna, and pharmacotherapy.The medieval practitioners defined various signs and symptoms, apparent causes, and hygienic and dietary rules for prevention of these disorders. Medieval Persian medical writings encouraged the treatment of psychological disorders by tackling the conditions that cause or contribute to the disorder and through the use of electrical-shock therapy, phlebotomy, psychotherapy, music and color therapy, and especially prescription of long lists of medicaments.Some of the approaches of doctors in medieval Persia are accepted today, although most remain largely unexamined. With further research, more of these treatments may be shown to be of use to modern medicine.",[],"['Nasser Vakili', 'Ali Gorji']"
2,"Burnout syndrome among psychiatric trainees in 22 countries: Risk increased by long working hours, lack of supervision, and psychiatry not being first career choice.","Postgraduate medical trainees experience high rates of burnout, but evidence regarding psychiatric trainees is missing. We aim to determine burnout rates among psychiatric trainees, and identify individual, educational and work-related factors associated with severe burnout.In an online survey psychiatric trainees from 22 countries were asked to complete the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-GS) and provide information on individual, educational and work-related parameters. Linear mixed models were used to predict the MBI-GS scores, and a generalized linear mixed model to predict severe burnout.This is the largest study on burnout and training conditions among psychiatric trainees to date. Complete data were obtained from 1980 out of 7625 approached trainees (26%; range 17.8-65.6%). Participants were 31.9 (SD 5.3) years old with 2.8 (SD 1.9) years of training. Severe burnout was found in 726 (36.7%) trainees. The risk was higher for trainees who were younger (P<0.001), without children (P=0.010), and had not opted for psychiatry as a first career choice (P=0.043). After adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics, years in training and country differences in burnout, severe burnout remained associated with long working hours (P<0.001), lack of supervision (P<0.001), and not having regular time to rest (P=0.001). Main findings were replicated in a sensitivity analysis with countries with response rate above 50%.Besides previously described risk factors such as working hours and younger age, this is the first evidence of negative influence of lack of supervision and not opting for psychiatry as a first career choice on trainees' burnout.","['Burnout', 'Psychiatry', 'Risk factors', 'Supervision', 'Training']","['N Jovanovi??', 'A Podlesek', 'U Volpe', 'E Barrett', 'S Ferrari', 'M Rojnic Kuzman', 'P Wuyts', 'S Papp', 'A Nawka', 'A Vaida', 'A Moscoso', 'O Andlauer', 'M Tateno', 'G Lydall', 'V Wong', 'J Rujevic', 'N Platz Clausen', 'R Psaras', 'A Delic', 'M A Losevich', 'S Flegar', 'P Cr??pin', 'E Shmunk', 'I Kuvshinov', 'E Loibl-Wei??', 'J Beezhold']"
2,A Qualitative Analysis of Stress and Relaxation Themes Contributing to Burnout in First-Year Psychiatry and Medicine Residents.,"Qualitative research on trainee well-being can add nuance to the understanding of propagators of burnout, and the role for interventions aimed at supporting well-being. This qualitative study was conducted to identify (i) situations and environments that cause stress for trainees, (ii) stress-reducing activities that trainees utilize, and (iii) whether trainees who report distress (high burnout and depression scores) describe different stressors and relaxation factors than those who do not.The study was conducted with a convenience sample of first-year medicine and psychiatry residents at a large urban teaching hospital. Participants were asked to complete electronic stress and relaxation diaries daily for 1??week. Diary entries were coded for recurrent themes. Participants were screened for burnout and depression. Codes were compared by subgroup based on baseline burnout and depression status to elucidate if specific themes emerged in these subgroups.Study sample included 51 interns. Sixteen (16/50, 32%) screened positive for burnout and three (3/50, 14%) had a positive depression screen. The most common stressors related to aspects of the learning environment, compounded by feeling under-equipped, overwhelmed, or out of time. The majority of relaxation activities involved social connection, food, other comforts, and occurred outside of the hospital environment.This study reveals that interns (regardless of burnout or depression screen) identify stressors that derive primarily from organizational, interpersonal, and cultural experiences of the learning environment; whereas relaxation themes are diversely represented across realms (home, leisure, social, health), though emphasize activities that occur outside of the work place.","['Burnout', 'Learning environment', 'Residency', 'Well-being']","['Nicole M Benson', 'Deanna Chaukos', 'Heather Vestal', 'Emma F Chad-Friedman', 'John W Denninger', 'Christina P C Borba']"
2,[Transdiagnostic psychiatry: work in progress].,"There is an increasing awareness that the current approach to clinical thought and work in psychiatry in relation to psychiatric diagnosis, treatment and research has its limitations. This necessitates a process to reform both the clinical practice and future scientific research. One way to reform this is the transdiagnostic approach.To clarify the psychological, biological and therapeutic aspects of a transdiagnostic approach in psychiatry.An analysis of new approaches based on recent findings from the recent literature.Transdiagnostic psychiatry is a relatively new concept which is still under development. The examples extracted from the reviewed literature on developmental psychology, neurobiology and treatment demonstrate that this approach may lead to improvements in clinical care and generate new etiological insights.A transdiagnostic approach in psychiatry may lead to new insights that are relevant for clinical practice and future scientific research.",[],"['T A M J van Amelsvoort', 'M C Klaassen', 'O A van den Heuvel']"
2,Teaching Empathy: the Implementation of a Video Game into a Psychiatry Clerkship Curriculum.,"Empathy plays an important role for physicians, but the literature demonstrates that it often deteriorates during medical school. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of the interactive video game ""That Dragon, Cancer"" as a tool to teach empathy to third-year medical students.The authors gave a modified, Jefferson Scales of Physician Empathy (JSPE) to 84 third-year medical students in their psychiatry clerkship before and after they played and completed ""That Dragon, Cancer"" during the 2016-2017 academic calendar year.The average level of empathy in the students as measured by least squares means of the answers to the truncated JSPE improved after playing through ""That Dragon, Cancer"" (5.7738 vs 6.2322, p?€?<?€?0.0001). The majority of students agreed that learning empathy through video games was preferable and more effective than traditional didactics.Interactive video games such as ""That Dragon, Cancer"" may be useful as part of innovative curricula to improve empathy among third-year medical students.","['Empathy', 'Psychiatry education', 'Third year medical school', 'Video games']","['Andrew Chen', 'Jessie J Hanna', 'Adithya Manohar', 'Anthony Tobia']"
2,Does access to role models influence future career choice? Impact of psychiatry teaching on recently graduated doctors in the United Kingdom.,The authors determined who provides formal psychiatry teaching to newly-qualified doctors and whether the amount of such teaching correlates to a later career preference for psychiatry.Data were collected on the cohort starting work in 2010 until applying to a specialty training program 16 months later. Total hours of psychiatry teaching was compared with the number choosing a residency in the same specialty.A total of 19 hospitals in northwest England provided teaching programs for their interns and first-year residents (U.K. foundation doctors); 15 provided information on doctors' later specialty choice. Only 2.3% of teaching was dedicated to psychiatry. Doctors led a higher proportion of medicine or surgery sessions (63%) than those on psychiatry (48%). Provision of psychiatry teaching was associated with entering psychiatry residency.Hospitals providing the most formal psychiatry training have the highest proportions matriculating into a psychiatry residency.,[],"['Andrew Collier', 'Adam Moreton']"
2,[Shall psychiatry change its target? Reflections on the evolving role of psychiatry].,"In this paper we will describe cultural, social and scientific changes occurred in psychiatry in the last years, identifying the new target for mental health professionals. Groups of young psychiatrists from the Italian Psychiatric Association, the European Psychiatric Association and the World Psychiatric Association have established an international network that launched a debate on the future role of psychiatry. In a rapidly changing world, there is the need to: 1) adapt training in psychiatry to the modern world; 2) identify the new target of mental health professionals; 3) enhance the image of psychiatry in the society; 4) overcome stigma towards people with mental disorders. In recent years, socio-cultural and scientific changes have had a significant impact on the psychiatrists' clinical practice. Mental health professionals should deal with these changes appropriately in order to overcome the current ""crisis"" of psychiatry, which should be considered as a developmental phase rather than a conceptual one. From time to time psychiatry is criticized both from inside and outside the profession. The current crisis was unavoidable due to the recent socio-cultural changes, but it should be considered an opportunity to adapt the profession to modern times.

2,[Psychiatry and Biopolitics in context of war: Understanding conflict to build the post-conflict].,"The purpose of this document is to present a review on biopolitics and psychiatry in the context of war, considering that this is where the greatest number of altered and deviant behaviours is generated. Along this line, as it is not about the psychopathology, but of its behaviour, of the approaches of Michel Foucault as regards the relationships of power, as such that it allows introducing the reader to a new perspective of thinking and understanding of the elements that have given rise to the maintenance of violent behaviour patterns and of the war itself. It tries to show the reader a different approach in which it is proposed that psychiatry can be actively involved in mitigation of all those schemes that ingrained the violence that have contributed to the perpetuation of war in modern society. Considering traditional approaches created to define human behaviour and mental illness only represented by a Disease code (ICD/DSM) are not sufficient to understand them. It induces the reader to reflect using practical examples that allows them to visualize, through a hypothetical scenario, elements of biopolitics that influence the behaviour, and the role of power relationships in the dynamics of population, particularly those who have grown up in circumstances of vulnerability and violence, and showing how psychiatry faces the points raised by biopolitics. That is why understanding this topic is necessary to help change behaviour and those patterns that help maintain behaviours that lead to violence and war itself. It is about re-thinking human behaviour as a result of a cultural and bio-political context that determines in the individual a way of acting, that regardless of the point in history or the place where you are, it is established as their usually form of behaviour in the struggle to survival.","['Biopolitics', 'Biopol??tica', 'Cultura y guerra', 'Culture and war', 'Psiquiatr??a', 'Psychiatry']",['Paula Ariadna Corzo P??rez']
2,Psychological medicine and the future of psychiatry.,"Psychological medicine (liaison psychiatry) aims to integrate psychiatry into other areas of medicine. It is currently enjoying considerable expansion. The degree to which it can take advantage of this opportunity will be important not only for its own future, but also for the survival of psychiatry as a medical discipline. ",[],['Michael Sharpe']
2,"Managing madness, murderers and paedophiles: Understanding change in the field of English forensic psychiatry.","This paper discusses changes occurring in the field of English forensic psychiatry which appear to be linked to feelings of discomfort amongst medical professionals who manage care in such settings. These changes are neither the result of a sudden 'shock' to the system, nor small improvisations at the margins, but instead appear to reflect a growing perception amongst psychiatrists of accepted field practice as inadequate for some types of patients. To understand how feelings and emotions are implicated in these changes we draw on and develop the work of Pierre Bourdieu to suggest that changes must be seen in the context of field tensions, which have implications for habitus. However, we do not view feelings of discomfort merely as a response to these tensions. Instead we suggest a more dynamic process. The habitus plays a key role in structuring what people pay attention to, how they perceive it and therefore, whether they experience particular feelings in the first place.","['Bourdieu', 'Change', 'Emotion', 'England', 'Forensic psychiatry', 'Mental health', 'Professionals']","['Ruth McDonald', 'Vivek Furtado', 'Birgit Vollm']"
2,Neurofeedback: One of today's techniques in psychiatry?,"Neurofeedback is a technique that aims to teach a subject to regulate a brain parameter measured by a technical interface to modulate his/her related brain and cognitive activities. However, the use of neurofeedback as a therapeutic tool for psychiatric disorders remains controversial. The aim of this review is to summarize and to comment the level of evidence of electroencephalogram (EEG) neurofeedback and real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback for therapeutic application in psychiatry.Literature on neurofeedback and mental disorders but also on brain computer interfaces (BCI) used in the field of neurocognitive science has been considered by the group of expert of the Neurofeedback evaluation & training (NExT) section of the French Association of biological psychiatry and neuropsychopharmacology (AFPBN).Results show a potential efficacy of EEG-neurofeedback in the treatment of attentional-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, even if this is still debated. For other mental disorders, there is too limited research to warrant the use of EEG-neurofeedback in clinical practice. Regarding fMRI neurofeedback, the level of evidence remains too weak, for now, to justify clinical use. The literature review highlights various unclear points, such as indications (psychiatric disorders, pathophysiologic rationale), protocols (brain signals targeted, learning characteristics) and techniques (EEG, fMRI, signal processing).The field of neurofeedback involves psychiatrists, neurophysiologists and researchers in the field of brain computer interfaces. Future studies should determine the criteria for optimizing neurofeedback sessions. A better understanding of the learning processes underpinning neurofeedback could be a key element to develop the use of this technique in clinical practice.","['EEG', 'Imagerie fonctionnelle par r??sonance magn??tique en temps r??el', 'Neurofeedback', 'Psychiatric disorder', 'Real-time fMRI', 'Troubles psychiatriques', '??lectroenc??phalographie']","['M Arns', 'J-M Batail', 'S Bioulac', 'M Congedo', 'C Daudet', 'D Drapier', 'T Fovet', 'R Jardri', 'M Le-Van-Quyen', 'F Lotte', 'D Mehler', 'J-A Micoulaud-Franchi', 'D Purper-Ouakil', 'F Vialatte', 'NExT group']"
2,Patients' attitudes towards and acceptance of coercion in psychiatry.,"Coercive interventions for psychiatric patients are controversial. Research on different preventive measures has increased over the last years. The present study examined patients' attitudes towards and understanding of previously experienced coercive measures as well as their preferences related to coercive measures and possible alternatives. In total, 213 patients who had experienced coercion and 51 patient controls (patients staying voluntarily on a closed ward with no coercive treatment) from three acute wards were examined via expert interviews and questionnaires in the framework of a naturalistic trial. Assessments included a new self-developed questionnaire as well as instruments measuring psychopathology. Patients who had experienced coercion differed from controls in both symptoms and insight into their illness. As expected, ""noninvasive measures"" (e.g., the use of a ""soft room,"" observation in seclusion) were better accepted by patients than ""invasive measures"" (e.g., mechanical restraint, forced medication). Forced medication and mechanical restraint were less well accepted than involuntary hospitalization, seclusion, or video surveillance. The retrospective understanding of coercive measures increased over the course of treatment. In addition, patients rated a number of options for reducing coercion on the wards, particularly music or exercises. A large subgroup indicated they would like to discuss future admissions with the staff.","['Compulsory treatment', 'Forced medication', 'Hospitalization', 'Involuntary treatment', 'Restraint', 'Seclusion']","['Eva Krieger', 'Steffen Moritz', 'Ricarda Weil', 'Matthias Nagel']"
2,Psychiatry in the Deep South: a pilot study of integrated training for psychiatry residents and seminary students.,"The authors describe an interdisciplinary training experience developed for psychiatry residents and seminary students that assessed each group's beliefs and attitudes toward the other's profession. The training was designed to enhance awareness, positive attitudes, and interaction between the disciplines.From 2005 to 2008, PGY-2 general-psychiatry residents and PGY-5 child-psychiatry residents (N=30) participated alongside psychology interns (N=13) and seminary students (N=41). The intervention consisted of two 3-hour sessions. Measurements addressed demographics, participants' spirituality, and attitudes toward mental illness, mental-health practitioners, and clergy.The psychiatry residents' knowledge regarding the training of clergy was significantly increased by the training sessions. The seminary students' attitudes and knowledge of psychiatry/psychology changed significantly in a positive direction.This pilot course had a positive impact on both groups of participants. This model could be modified for other psychiatry programs, to include clergy students of different religious faiths as relevant to the demographics of the training location.",[],"['Craig Stuck', 'Nioaka Campbell', 'John Bragg', 'Robert Moran']"
2,Cultural considerations in forensic psychiatry: The issue of forced medication.,"There has been an ongoing debate regarding the forced use of antipsychotic medications and both the psychiatric and legal professions have reacted strongly to the growing debate. Within the penological context, cases such as Washington v. Harper, Riggins v. Nevada, and Sell v. United States established the framework for determining when antipsychotic medication may be forcibly administered. Medication decisions under the Sell and Riggins cases are to be approved at judicial hearings; whereas, administrative hearings are sufficient for Harper cases. Forensic psychiatrists are also given responsibility in making the legal decision of whether or not to forcibly treat a patient with psychotropic medication against his will. In making this critical decision, a significant factor that is often minimized is the cultural background of the patient. The purpose of this paper is to present cultural factors to be considered in forced medication. Focusing on the culture defense argument, a review of how the legal system has dealt with cultural implications of a case will be presented. This paper will then discuss cultural issues embedded in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric patients by forensic psychiatrists who are called upon to make the decision of whether or not to force medicate a patient against his will. Lastly, recommendations and a framework for providing a culturally sensitive assessment during the decision to forcibly medicate a patient with psychotropic medication will be offered.","['Cultural competence', 'Cultural defense', 'Forced medication', 'Forensic psychiatry', 'Transcultural psychiatry']",['Josepha Campinha-Bacote']
2,Neuropsychiatry and neuroscience education of psychiatry trainees: attitudes and barriers.,"The American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training (AADPRT) Task Force on Neuropsychiatry and Neuroscience Education of Psychiatry Residents was established in 2011 with the charge to seek information about what the field of psychiatry considers the core topics in neuropsychiatry and neuroscience to which psychiatry residents should be exposed; whether there are any ""competencies"" in this area on which the field agrees; whether psychiatry departments have the internal capacity to teach these topics if they are desirable; and what the reception would be for ""portable curricula"" in neuroscience.The task force reviewed the literature and developed a survey instrument to be administered nationwide to all psychiatry residency program directors. The AADPRT Executive Committee assisted with the survey review, and their feedback was incorporated into the final instrument.In 2011-2012, 226 adult and child and adolescent psychiatry residency program directors responded to the survey, representing over half of all US adult and child psychiatry training directors. About three quarters indicated that faculty resources were available in their departments but 39% felt the lack of neuropsychiatry faculty and 36% felt the absence of neuroscience faculty to be significant barriers. Respectively, 64 and 60% felt that neuropsychiatry and psychiatric neuroscience knowledge were very important or critically important to the provision of excellent care. Ninety-two percent were interested in access to portable neuroscience curricula.There is widespread agreement among training directors on the importance of neuropsychiatry and neuroscience knowledge to general psychiatrists but barriers to training exist, including some programs that lack faculty resources and a dearth of portable curricula in these areas.",[],"['Sheldon Benjamin', 'Michael J Travis', 'Joseph J Cooper', 'Chandlee C Dickey', 'Claudia L Reardon']"

2,[The most important obstacles of the development of Hungarian psychiatry].,"A quarter of a century ago the change of the political system in Hungary precipitated a serious value-crisis and caused a lot of harmful effects in nurturing and the development of psychiatry. The author establishes that the attack against psychiatry is more intensive than previously but neither the education and health management nor the psychiatric leadership could cope with these difficulties. It can't be denied that the foundation of lifelong mental health begins in the early life years and about 75% of the first Mental Disorder manifests in adolescence and youth. We are not able to ensure the special rights of every child according to the Hungarian Constitution and the Declaration of the Rights of the Child by the United Nations. The large inequalities within the country, the lack of paramount mental education and nurturing, the lack of essential, consistent eternal values, the lack of required psychiatric care system are huge obstacles of the development of healthy individual and leads to self-destructive behaviour and several, serious physical and mental disorders. The purpose of the author is to call psychiatrists' attention to the main obstacles of the development of Hungarian Psychiatric Care System. The main obstacles of the present psychiatric care system: 1. Unclarified notions, confusion of ideas. 2. Somatic, neurologic, mental, cultural-social and spiritual ignorance. 3. Lack of organization in Mental Education and Psychiatric Care System. 4. Value-crisis in our society despite the fact that the ""Council of Wise Men"" created a ""Scale of the Essential Consistent Eternal Values"" for the Hungarian Education System in 2008. 5. Lack of mental health prevention both in education system and health care system. There is no teaching of hygiene lessons in the Hungarian schools. 6. Negligence and selfishness among the population. 7. Disinterest among competent authorities. 8. Leaving the most important possibilities out of consideration. The author establishes that the elimination of the above mentioned obstacles, the high standard of psychiatric care system, - especially the child psychiatric care system - and paramount mental education are extraordinarily important to prevent most psychiatric disorders and help the development of healthy and happy people. If human individuals are the most important ones in our society, if we eliminate the main obstacles of the development of psychiatry, we ensure to improve Hungarian psychiatry again, we shall be able to say that ""the spiritual light is shining through the windows of every house"", and our work will not be a quixotic struggle or ""tilting at windmills"".

2,[Experience of liaison psychiatry in Morocco: transversal study over 24 months].,"Liaison psychiatry is a discipline caring for psychiatric disorders in patients of general hospitals. It involves clinical, educational, and research aspects. The liaison psychiatry supports patients hospitalized for full-time in medical and surgical departments, patients admitted in day-hospital and patients treated in the emergency department. In this transversal study, we assessed the liaison psychiatry impact that is still in development stage in Morocco. This study lasted 24 months, and was conducted at the University Hospital in Fez, Morocco.The goal of this work was to evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders managed by liaison psychiatry, identify those requiring medical and surgical departments of such psychiatric support, and classify the motivations involved in their needs.This transversal study was initiated in January 2010 and has lasted 24 months. The study recruited 180 patients requiring psychiatric consultation from different medical and surgical departments at the University Hospital in Fes, Morocco. The psychiatric assessment was based on a psychiatric interview using the MINI. The data were collected by a certified psychiatrist using a questionnaire containing 24 items. After initial psychiatric assessment, the follow-up was proposed to the patient in the psychiatric department.During this study, 22 medical and surgical departments of our University Hospital had requested a psychiatric assessment for their patients. Most demands were respectively emitted by the Department of Dermatology (16%) and Nephrology (11%). The most common motivations for psychiatric consultations were respectively psychomotor agitation (17%) and an evaluation of suicide attempts (17%). Depressive and psychotic disorders were the most diagnosed disorders with 47% and 11% respectively. The psychiatric support was based on pharmacological treatment in 60% of cases. Finally, the outcome was favourable in 80% of followed cases.Hospitalized patients in different medical and surgical departments of the University Hospital of Fez have demonstrated a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders. This constitutes a very strong motivation to setup a department of liaison psychiatry. This would allow a better psychiatric support and follow-up of patients.","['Liaison psychiatry', 'Prevalence', 'Pr??valence', 'Psychiatrie de liaison']","['M Barrimi', 'F Elghazouani', 'C Aarab', 'A Tliji', 'S Rharrabti', 'F Lahlou', 'I Rammouz', 'R Aalouane']"
2,[Positive psychiatry].,Positive psychiatry (PP) is a field within psychiatry with a particular focus on promoting well-being in people who already have or are at high risk of developing mental or physical illness.

One hundred and nineteen participants answered the survey (16 program directors, 103 residents) allowing for a margin of error of 8.4% at a 95% confidence interval. Research was rated as important in informing clinical practice (87.0% yes, 13.0% no), but only 28.7% of respondents reported that it was taught well at their home institution (33.0% no, 38.3% neutral).

2,Recruitment to psychiatry in the Czech Republic: 'waiting for resuscitation'?,"Recruitment to psychiatry is becoming a serious obstacle in providing first-class mental health treatment in many countries worldwide. We attempt to address this burning issue by examining medical student's attitudes towards psychiatry and factors influencing their career choice in the Czech Republic. In 2010, 71 students in their last year of medical school at the First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague were recruited in this quantitative cross-sectional online study. From the sample, 16% (n = 11) of students were considering psychiatry as a career path. An important factor in choosing psychiatry as a career path was personal/family presence of mental illness. Longer experience with psychiatry placement also contributed to the choice of psychiatry, as well as participation in elective courses or psychiatric research projects. Students considering psychiatry were less systematic compared to the group not considering psychiatry. Low reported levels of recruitment to psychiatry present a problematic issue in the Czech Republic. To make psychiatry more appealing to medical students, proactive steps by the relevant stakeholders need to be implemented. These strategies should include steps such as allocating more time for psychiatry in the medical curriculum, better quality of lectures, and the inclusion of additional elective courses.",[],"['Boris Dvoracek', 'Alexander Nawka', 'Lucie Nawkova', 'Jan Vevera', 'Gregory Lydall', 'Amit Malik', 'Kitty Farooq', 'Dinesh Bhugra']"
2,Exploring the ideas and expectations of German medical students towards career choices and the speciality of psychiatry.,"The aim of this study was to explore the ideas and expectations of medical students toward their career choices and the speciality of psychiatry. A total of 323 students of the Hannover Medical School filled in a questionnaire about their career choices, preferred medical specialization, factors of influence on career choices and attitude towards psychiatry. The three most important factors of influence appeared to be: (1) work-life balance, (2) flexible working hours, (3) career prospects. Although expectations towards the professional life of psychiatrists were quite positive among the students, there was only a small number of students (n = 53 of 318 respondents, 17%) interested in specializing in psychiatry. Important reasons for choosing psychiatry included personal experience with somatic or mental health issues and practical experience in psychiatry. Most of the students experienced clinical exposure to psychiatry but at a much later period in the curriculum. For a career choice of psychiatry as a speciality it seems to be important to start psychiatric education in medical school early. The positive aspects of the professional life in psychiatry, such as flexible working hours, career prospects and good work-life balance should be more emphasized.",[],"['Frauke A E Baller', 'Karin V Ludwig', 'Clara L Kinas-Gnadt Olivares', 'Iris-Tatjana Graef-Calliess']"

The aim of this paper is to systematically review literature on the impact of the psychiatry clerkship to determine the effect on attitudes towards psychiatry and to psychiatry as a career.A systematic review was undertaken. The following key search words were used to search a number of electronic databases: medical student/s, attitude/s, psychiatry and clerkship. Studies published in the English language from 1990 to the present were included. Studies were included if they were based on a pre-/post-design, i.e. the same students must have participated in the study both before and after the clerkship.Twenty-six studies from 19 countries were identified for the review. Sixteen studies reported an overall improvement in attitudes towards psychiatry post-clerkship, and ten found no change in attitudes. In terms of career choice, nine studies reported an increase in the number of students interested in psychiatry as a career post-clerkship, nine found no impact on career choice and, in eight studies, it was not assessed. A number of positive and negative factors regarding the clerkship were identified.Overall, the psychiatry clerkship has a positive impact on students' attitudes towards psychiatry, but does not improve interest in psychiatry as a career option. For those students particularly interested in psychiatry, the challenge is to maintain their enthusiasm post-clerkship. Charismatic teachers, mentorship and stigma reduction may be effective strategies. Future research needs to more clearly identify specific components of the clerkship that are viewed favorably by students.",[],['Zaza Lyons']
2,Assessing Cultural Psychiatry Milestones Through an Objective Structured Clinical Examination.,"Culturally appropriate tools for patient assessment are needed to train psychiatric residents. An objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) can be a helpful tool for evaluating trainees in the psychiatry milestones pertaining to cultural competency.Seventeen psychiatry residents and fellows at the University of Massachusetts participated in two small-group OSCE exercises to learn cultural interviewing using the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview. Trainee groups presented a cultural formulation and received feedback. Participants were surveyed about their comfort with cultural interviewing before and after the exercise.Paired t tests (N?€?=?€?16) showed that mean level of comfort with the Cultural Formulation Interview increased by a mean of 0.5 points after training (t?€?=?€?3.16, df?€?=?€?15, p?€?<?€?01 95??% CI?€?=?€?163-837).The UMass culturally appropriate assessment OSCE enhanced psychiatric trainees' comfort with culturally appropriate interviewing using the Cultural Formulation Interview.","['Cultural competency', 'Objective structured clinical examination', 'Psychiatry milestones']","['Auralyd Padilla', 'Sheldon Benjamin', 'Roberto Lewis-Fernandez']"
2,"Childhood developmental disorders: an academic and clinical convergence point for psychiatry, neurology, psychology and pediatrics.","Significant advances in understanding brain development and behavior have not been accompanied by revisions of traditional academic structure. Disciplinary isolation and a lack of meaningful interdisciplinary opportunities are persistent barriers in academic medicine. To enhance clinical practice, research, and training for the next generation, academic centers will need to take bold steps that challenge traditional departmental boundaries. Such change is not only desirable but, in fact, necessary to bring about a truly innovative and more effective approach to treating disorders of the developing brain.I focus on developmental disorders as a convergence point for transcending traditional academic boundaries. First, the current taxonomy of developmental disorders is described with emphasis on how current diagnostic systems inadvertently hinder research progress. Second, I describe the clinical features of autism, a phenomenologically defined condition, and Rett and fragile X syndromes, neurogenetic diseases that are risk factors for autism. Finally, I describe how the fields of psychiatry, psychology, neurology, and pediatrics now have an unprecedented opportunity to promote an interdisciplinary approach to training, research, and clinical practice and, thus, advance a deeper understanding of developmental disorders.Research focused on autism is increasingly demonstrating the heterogeneity of individuals diagnosed by DSM criteria. This heterogeneity hinders the ability of investigators to replicate research results as well as progress towards more effective, etiology-specific interventions. In contrast, fragile X and Rett syndromes are 'real' diseases for which advances in research are rapidly accelerating towards more disease-specific human treatment trials.A major paradigm shift is required to improve our ability to diagnose and treat individuals with developmental disorders. This paradigm shift must take place at all levels - training, research and clinical activity. As clinicians and scientists who are currently constrained by disciplinary-specific history and training, we must move towards redefining ourselves as clinical neuroscientists with shared interests and expertise that permit a more cohesive and effective approach to improving the lives of patients.",[],['Allan L Reiss']

We sought to gather information on the specific problems and needs occurring during the transition of mentally ill adolescents from child and adolescent to adult psychiatry.Professionals (psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists) working in child and adolescent psychiatry and adult psychiatry (N = 86) were assessed by means of an online survey concerning their experience with the transition of young adults.Almost all of the subjects queried (98.8 %) considered the current system inappropriate, and the majority (70.9 %) thought that patients would not tolerate transition from youth to adult psychiatric institutions very well. Only 16.3 % reported having a structured transition protocol at their workplace. Further 83.7 % expressed the need to improve collaboration between adolescent and adult psychiatry.This sample of Austrian healthcare professionals describes large deficits regarding transitional issues in psychiatry. There is an urgent need to establish structured protocols for transition, especially since experiences occurring during this vulnerable period are crucial to the mental health of young people later in life.","['Adoleszenzpsychiatrie', 'Erwachsenenpsychiatrie Expert(innen)', 'Onlineuntersuchung', 'Transitionspsychiatrie', 'adolescent psychiatry', 'adult psychiatry', 'experts', 'online survey', 'transition in psychiatry']","['Eva Pollak', 'Nestor D Kapusta', 'Robert Diehm', 'Paul L Plener', 'Katrin Skala']"
2,Why medical students choose psychiatry - a 20 country cross-sectional survey.,"Recruitment to psychiatry is insufficient to meet projected mental health service needs world-wide. We report on the career plans of final year medical students from 20 countries, investigating factors identified from the literature which influence psychiatric career choice.Cross sectional electronic or paper survey. Subjects were final year medical students at 46 medical schools in participating countries. We assessed students' career intentions, motivations, medical school teaching and exposure to psychiatry. We assessed students' attitudes and personality factors. The main outcome measure was likelihood of specializing in psychiatry. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the joint effect of factors upon the main outcome.2198 of 9135 (24%) of students responded (range 4 to 91%) across the countries. Internationally 4.5% of students definitely considered psychiatry as a career (range 1 to 12%). 19% of students (range 0 to 33%) were ""quite likely"", and 25% were ""definitely not"" considering psychiatry. Female gender, experience of mental/physical illness, media portrayal of doctors, and positive attitudes to psychiatry, but not personality factors, were associated with choosing psychiatry. Quality of psychiatric placement (correlation coefficient = 0.22, p < 0.001) and number of placements (correlation coefficient =0.21, p < 0.001) were associated with higher ATP scores. During medical school, experience of psychiatric enrichment activities (special studies modules and university psychiatry clubs), experience of acutely unwell patients and perceived clinical responsibility were all associated with choice of psychiatry.Multilevel logistic regression revealed six factors associated with students choosing psychiatry: importance of own vocation, odds ratio (OR) 3.01, 95% CI 1.61 to 5.91, p < 0.001); interest in psychiatry before medical school, OR 10.8 (5.38 to 21.8, p < 0.001); undertaking a psychiatry special study module, OR 1.45 (1.05 to 2.01, p = 0.03) or elective OR 4.28 (2.87- 6.38, p < 0.001); membership of a university psychiatry club, OR 3.25 (2.87 to 6.38, p < 0.001); and exposure to didactic teaching, OR 0.54 (0.40 to 0.72, p < 0.001).We report factors relevant to medical student selection and psychiatry teaching which affect career choice.

2,The PsychSimCentre: teaching out-of-hours psychiatry to non-psychiatrists.,"Junior doctors have limited experience in psychiatry before starting their training placements. The out-of-hours setting offers specific challenges, and trainees are expected to cope despite being underprepared. We hyphothesised that simulation-based training would increase trainees' competence and confidence in approaching high-risk out-of-hours scenarios.A pilot study focused upon the first cohort of psychiatry trainees joining the North East London NHS Foundation Trust in 2012. During their induction (and prior to any clinical duties) each trainee took part in five high-risk clinical scenarios, assessed by a senior psychiatrist and service-user representative. The trainees were required to complete a survey exploring their confidence across nine core psychiatric clinical domains, both before and after the simulation training.The simulation training increased trainee confidence in all nine clinical domains. Before the simulation training, over half of the nine trainees self-rated themselves as having 'no confidence' in six of the nine clinical competencies. After the training, confidence levels had significantly increased, with only two of the competencies scoring any 'no confidence' ratings. There were mixed feelings by trainees on the use of service-user representatives in the training of doctors. Junior doctors have limited experience in psychiatry before starting their training placementsWe found that high-fidelity simulation training is a useful tool to prepare junior trainees in psychiatry to familiarise themselves with some of the high-risk scenarios that they are likely to encounter during out-of-hour on-call duties. We showed that this intervention increased trainees' confidence across a range of core psychiatric skills. This has significant implications in the provision of safe and effective patient care.",[],"['Ali Ajaz', 'Rhodri David', 'Mohan Bhat']"
2,"The ""Biopsychosocial Model"": 40 years of application in Psychiatry.","In 1977, the American pathologist and psychiatrist George Engel (1913-1999) published in the Journal Science his paper ""TheIn 1977, the American pathologist and psychiatrist George Engel (1913-1999) published in the Journal Science his paper ""Theneed for a new medical model: A challenge for biomedicine"", introducing the term Biopsychosocial Model. This model basedon the results of Engel's studies in ulcerative colitis, depression and psychogenic pain, constituted a challenge for biomedicineand the biomedical model. The basic principles of the model included the biological, psychological and social dimensions of the person's life and theperception that the person suffers as a whole and not as isolated organs. The doctor should use a holistic approach regardingillness and should consider his/her relation with the patient socially equal. The personality and the emotional reserves of thepatient, as well as the particular environmental conditions in which the person lives in should be taken into account. There is no doubt that the biopsychosocial model has established a more empathetic and compassionate approach in medical practice. Already since 1936, the general adaptation syndrome had been proposed by the Austrian-Canadian endocrinologist HansSeley (1907-1982), who emphasized that psychological stressful factors may have injurious consequences on health, while theresponse systems to stress may be dysregulated not only by genetic factors, but also from experiences and stressful life events,as well as by harmful behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and lack of physical exercise. Psychosocial factors may co-determine the patient's vulnerability and the illness's severity and course. The biopsychosocialmodel consider the interactions with genetic susceptibility, personality, stressful events and, generally, with the patient's socialcontext. Environmental factors increase the probability of the clinical expression of a mental disorder, play a role in the time ofonset of an illness's manifestation, and they can also protect a vulnerable person from the disease. Stressful experiences modify immunological response and influence treatment compliance. Non adherence to pharmacotherapy,as well as to the psychosocial interventions, may cause defective recovery of psychosocial functioning, recurrence ofthe disorder, as well as insufficient use of health resources and a higher health care cost. The psychoeducation of patients andtheir relatives by the application of the biopsychosocial model plays an important role in psychiatric therapeutics, and it mayalso be used via Internet in the frame of telepsychiatry. Results from neuroimaging studies have shown that the different kinds of human experiences, traumatic or therapeutic, havemeasurable influences on the brain function. Psychotherapy may modify the neuronal connections of the brain in the frame ofits plasticity, as was found by the discovery of synaptogenesis in response to learning and can, thus, be considered not only as astrictly psychological but also as a biopsychosocial form of treatment. Among the disadvantages of the biopsychosocial model have been reported the lack of a concise theoretical frameworkregarding its function and content, that it is complicated, difficulties in its coordination and assignment of responsibilities, aswell as problems with the education on it being multifaceted. The biopsychosocial model has been criticized that it does notconstitute a scientific or philosophical model, it does not provide an answer to the crucial question of how the biological, psychologicaland social variables interact in the disease's expression, that it does not provide guidance on the exact time of itsapplication and, finally, that it allows for a wide range of interventions without providing specific guidelines of a concrete therapeutic scheme. The person-centered diagnosis is based on the biopsychosocial model, connects science with humanism and uses all thepossible ways so that the clinicians, the patients and their families collaborate for a more effective management of the disease.This approach has been established by the World Psychiatric Association (WPA, 2007) as the program ""Psychiatry for the Person"". Psychiatry in everyday practice presents particularities versus other medical disciplines due to the complexity and polymorphismPsychiatry in everyday practice presents particularities versus other medical disciplines due to the complexity and polymorphismof the expression of mental disorders, their close relation to psychosocial factors, the lack of explicit pathognomonicelements and the stigmatization of mental illness. For these reasons, the biopsychosocial model is particularly applicable inpsychiatric disorders, but it should not be over looked also in somatic illnesses. The biopsychosocial model, despite the criticism it was subjected to, continues to offer valuable clinical, educational andresearch services, as well as to provide an important contribution to the formation of health policies, not only for psychiatry, butfor the whole of medicine as well.",[],['G Papadimitriou']
2,Daniel Stern's journey in infant psychiatry: interview by John A. Talbot.,"This interview with Professor Daniel Stern, conducted on February 16, 2012 by Dr. John Talbott, reviews the field of infant psychiatry, the history of which goes back more than 100 years. Sigmund Freud, then Melanie Klein, Anna Freud, Donald Winnicott, and, finally, Margaret Mahler, all psychoanalysts, influenced its development. Direct observation of very young infants and their mothers began in the latter half of the 20th century, and the subsequent course shifted through the influence of developmental psychologists and ethologists. This review concludes with Dr. Stern's predictions and fears about future directions of the field.",[],['Daniel Stern']
2,Senior medical students' attitudes toward psychiatry as a career choice before and after an undergraduate psychiatry internship in Iran.,"The study aimed to assess 1) the attitudes of medical students in the sixth and seventh years (known as interns in Iran) toward psychiatry as a career choice, and 2) the degree of attractiveness of psychiatry as a career choice, with regard to various defined aspects, before and after an undergraduate psychiatry internship (similar to the medical school psychiatry rotation in the United States, but mandatory in Iran) in three major medical schools in Tehran, the capital of Iran.Sixth- and seventh-year medical students (locally called interns, N=347) at Tehran, Shahid Beheshti, and Iran Universities of Medical Sciences were consecutively invited to complete anonymous self-report questionnaires designed to assess their perceptions of careers in psychiatry before and after internship in psychiatry wards. Also, students evaluated psychiatry in terms of the factors that reflected the degree of attractiveness of this specialty.Positive responses toward choosing psychiatry as a career were seen in 18.8% before and 20.0% after psychiatry rotation. No significant differences were observed in the positive responses before and after psychiatry internship. The students' opinions changed to a more attractive degree in terms of only 3 out of the 13 defined aspects. There was also no significant difference in the total score on attractiveness of psychiatry before and after the psychiatry internship.The study indicated that undergraduate psychiatry internship might not induce more students to consider psychiatry as a possible career. The present pattern of psychiatry education in Iran seems not to positively affect most aspects of medical students' attitudes toward psychiatry.",[],"['Homayoun Amini', 'Yasaman Moghaddam', 'Ali-Akbar Nejatisafa', 'Sara Esmaeili', 'Hosein Kaviani', 'Saeed Shoar', 'Amir Shabani', 'Mehdi Samimi-Ardestani', 'Amir Abbas Keshavarz Akhlaghi', 'Alireza Noroozi', 'Mostafa Mafi']"
2,Attitudes of medical students toward psychiatry and psychiatry as a career: a systematic review.,"The discipline of psychiatry, and psychiatry as a career option, have been negatively regarded by medical students for decades. There is a large amount of literature on attitudes of students and the factors that attract them to and detract from psychiatry. The aim of this article is to systematically review this literature from 1990 to the present time.The author undertook a systematic review searching a number of electronic databases using the following key words: medical students, attitudes, psychiatry, career. Studies were included in the review if they had been published in an English-language, peer-reviewed journal. Data extracted included year of publication, country where the study was conducted, study design and aim, sample size and response rate, year of study that students were in when they participated in the research, and main results.A total of 32 papers from 22 different countries were selected for inclusion; 12,144 students from 74 medical schools were surveyed. A mix of positive and negative attitudes toward psychiatry were identified, and, overall, attitudes were found to be positive. However, psychiatry as a career choice was rated poorly and found to be unpopular for many students.The studies undertaken to-date have identified and raised awareness of a wide range of negative and positive factors toward psychiatry. In order to encourage more students to consider psychiatry as a career, attention needs to focus more closely on the psychiatry curriculum and the development of innovative teaching strategies. This may overcome the negativity that students express toward psychiatry, improve recruitment rates to training programs, and put psychiatry on a more positive foundation for the future.",[],['Zaza Lyons']
3,Cellular Imaging of Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens.,"The spatial dimensions of host cells and bacterial microbes are perfectly suited to being studied by microscopy techniques. Therefore, cellular imaging has been instrumental in uncovering many paradigms of the intracellular lifestyle of microbes. Initially, microscopy was used as a qualitative, descriptive tool. However, with the onset of specific markers and the power of computer-assisted image analysis, imaging can now be used to gather quantitative data on biological processes. This makes imaging a driving force for the study of cellular phenomena. One particular imaging modality stands out, which is based on the physical principles of fluorescence. Fluorescence is highly specific and therefore can be exploited to label biomolecules of choice. It is also very sensitive, making it possible to follow individual molecules with this approach. Also, microscopy hardware has played an important role in putting microscopy in the spotlight for host-pathogen investigations. For example, microscopes have been automated for microscopy-based screenings. A new generation of microscopes and molecular probes are being used to image events below the resolution limit of light. Finally, workflows are being developed to link light microscopy with electron microscopy methods via correlative light electron microscopy. We are witnessing a golden age of cellular imaging in cellular microbiology.",[],"['Virginie St??venin', 'Jost Enninga']"
3,Critical Damage Values of R200 and 100Cr6 Steels Obtained by Hot Tensile Testing.,"The paper proposes a new method for determining critical damage values in hot forming processes. The method first involves performing tensile tests of axisymmetric samples and then simulating these tests numerically. Simulations are performed by the finite element method in a three-dimensional state of strain, including thermal phenomena occurring in the forming zone. The elaborated method is universal and can be used for different materials. The study is performed for two steel grades, i.e., R200 railway steel and 100Cr6 bearing steel. The results demonstrate that critical damage values strongly depend on the forming temperature.","['FEM', 'damage criterion', 'hot forming of steel', 'tensile test']","['Zbigniew Pater', 'Andrzej Gontarz']"
3,The effect of translation on the binding energy for transition-metal porphyrines adsorbed on Ag(111) surface.,"The characteristics of interaction between six transition-metal porphyrines and the Ag(111) surface are detailed here as resulted from DFT calculations. Van der Waals interactions as well as the strong correlation in 3d orbitals of transition metals were taken into account in all calculations, including the structural relaxation. For each system we investigate four relative positions of the metallic atom on top the surface. We show that the interaction between the transition metal and silver is the result of a combination between the dispersion interaction, charge transfer and weak chemical interaction. The detailed analysis of the physical properties, such as dipolar and magnetic moments and the molecule-surface charge transfer, analyzed for different geometric configurations allows us to propose qualitative models, relevant for the understanding of the self-assembly processes and related phenomena.","['Ag(111) surface', 'DFT+U', 'metal porphyrine', 'van der Waals']","['Luiza Buimaga-Iarinca', 'Cristian Morari']"
3,Autoimmunity in acute ischemic stroke and the role of blood-brain barrier: the dark side or the light one?,"This article presents a synopsis of the current data on the mechanisms of blood-brain barrier (BBB) alteration and autoimmune response in acute ischemic stroke. Most researchers confirm the relationship between the severity of immunobiochemical changes and clinical outcome of acute ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is accompanied by aseptic inflammation, which alters the brain tissue and exposes the co-stimulatory molecules of the immune system and the neuronal antigens. To date, BBB is not considered the border between the immune system and central nervous system, and the local immune subsystems are found within and behind the BBB. BBB disruption contributes to the leakage of brain autoantigens and induction of secondary autoimmune response to neuronal antigens and long-term inflammation. Glymphatic system function is altered and jeopardized both in hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke types. The receptors of innate immunity (toll-like receptor-2 and toll-like receptor-4) are also involved in acute ischemia-reperfusion injury. Immune response is related to the key processes of blood clotting and fibrinolysis. At the same time, the stroke-induced immune activation may promote reparation phenomena in the brain. Subsequent research on the reduction of the acute ischemic brain injury through the target regulation of the immune response is promising.","['autoimmunity', 'blood-brain barrier', 'cell death', 'inflammation', 'innate immunity', 'stroke']","['Nikolay V Tsygan', 'Alexandr P Trashkov', 'Igor V Litvinenko', 'Viktoriya A Yakovleva', 'Alexandr V Ryabtsev', 'Andrey G Vasiliev', 'Leonid P Churilov']"
3,Functional analysis of the Chloroplast GrpE (CGE) proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana.,"The function of proteins depends on specific partners that regulate protein folding, degradation and protein-protein interactions, such partners are the chaperones and cochaperones. In chloroplasts, proteins belonging to several families of chaperones have been identified: chaperonins (Cpn60s), Hsp90s (Hsp90-5/Hsp90C), Hsp100s (Hsp93/ClpC) and Hsp70s (cpHsc70s). Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that cpHsc70 chaperones are involved in molecular processes like protein import, protein folding and oligomer formation that impact important physiological aspects in plants such as thermotolerance and thylakoid biogenesis. Despite the vast amount of data existing around the function of cpHcp70s chaperones, very little attention has been paid to the roles of DnaJ and GrpE cochaperones in the chloroplast. In this study, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the chloroplastic GrpE (CGE) proteins from 71 species. Based on their phylogenetic relationships and on a motif enrichment analysis, we propose a classification system for land plants' CGEs, which include two independent groups with specific primary structure traits. Furthermore, using in vivo assays we determined that the two CGEs from A. thaliana (AtCGEs) complement the mutant phenotype displayed by a knockout E. coli strain defective in the bacterial grpE gene. Moreover, we determined in planta that the two AtCGEs are bona fide chloroplastic proteins, which form the essential homodimers needed to establish direct physical interactions with the cpHsc70-1 chaperone. Finally, we found evidence suggesting that AtCGE1 is involved in specific physiological phenomena in A. thaliana, such as the chloroplastic response to heat stress, and the correct oligomerization of the photosynthesis-related LHCII complex.","['Arabidopsis', 'Chaperones', 'Chloroplast', 'Cochaperones', 'GrpE', 'Hsp70']","['L A de Luna-Valdez', 'C I Villase??or-Salmer??n', 'E Cordoba', 'R Vera-Estrella', 'P Le??n-Mej??a', 'A A Guevara-Garc??a']"
3,Increased Cell Traction-Induced Prestress in Dynamically Cultured Microtissues.,"Prestress is a phenomenon present in many cardiovascular tissues and has profound implications on their <i>in vivo</i> functionality. For instance, the <i>in vivo</i> mechanical properties are altered by the presence of prestress, and prestress also influences tissue growth and remodeling processes. The development of tissue prestress typically originates from complex growth and remodeling phenomena which yet remain to be elucidated. One particularly interesting mechanism in which prestress develops is by active traction forces generated by cells embedded in the tissue by means of their actin stress fibers. In order to understand how these traction forces influence tissue prestress, many have used microfabricated, high-throughput, micrometer scale setups to culture microtissues which actively generate prestress to specially designed cantilevers. By measuring the displacement of these cantilevers, the prestress response to all kinds of perturbations can be monitored. In the present study, such a microfabricated tissue gauge platform was combined with the commercially available Flexcell system to facilitate dynamic cyclic stretching of microtissues. First, the setup was validated to quantify the dynamic microtissue stretch applied during the experiments. Next, the microtissues were subjected to a dynamic loading regime for 24 h. After this interval, the prestress increased to levels over twice as high compared to static controls. The prestress in these tissues was completely abated when a ROCK-inhibitor was added, showing that the development of this prestress can be completely attributed to the cell-generated traction forces. Finally, after switching the microtissues back to static loading conditions, or when removing the ROCK-inhibitor, prestress magnitudes were restored to original values. These findings show that intrinsic cell-generated prestress is a highly controlled parameter, where the actin stress fibers serve as a mechanostat to regulate this prestress. Since almost all cardiovascular tissues are exposed to a dynamic loading regime, these findings have important implications for the mechanical testing of these tissues, or when designing cardiovascular tissue engineering therapies.","['experiments', 'in vitro', 'microtissue', 'prestress', 'tissue-engineering']","['Mathieu A J van Kelle', 'Nilam Khalil', 'Jasper Foolen', 'Sandra Loerakker', 'Carlijn V C Bouten']"

This IF, related to fast moving magnetic DWs, decays rapidly after interruptions of cooling/heating cycles.

3,Modeling Approach Influences Dynamics of a Vector-Borne Pathogen System.,"The choice of a modeling approach is a critical decision in the modeling process, as it determines the complexity of the model and the phenomena that the model captures. In this paper, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) and compared it to a previously published ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, both developed to describe the same biological system although with slightly different emphases given the underlying assumptions and processes of each modeling approach. We used both models to examine the effect of insect vector life history and behavior traits on the spread of a vector-borne plant virus, and determine how choice of approach affects the results and their biological interpretation. A non-random distribution of insect vectors across plant hosts emerged in the IBM version of the model and was not captured by the ODE. This distribution led simultaneously to a slower-growing vector population and a faster spread of the pathogen among hosts. The IBM model also enabled us to test the effect of potential control measures to slow down virus transmission. We found that removing virus-infected hosts was a more effective strategy for controlling infection than removing vector-infested hosts. Our findings highlight the need to carefully consider possible modeling approaches before constructing a model.","['Barley yellow dwarf virus', 'Individual-based model', 'Mean field', 'Ordinary differential equation', 'Vector-borne plant pathogen']","['Allison K Shaw', 'Morganne Igoe', 'Alison G Power', 'Nilsa A Bosque-P??rez', 'Angela Peace']"
3,Identification of tunneling and multiphoton ionization in intermediate Keldysh parameter regime.,"Quantitative identification of tunneling ionization (TI) and multiphoton ionization (MPI) with Keldysh parameter ?? in intermediate regime is of great importance to better understand various ionization-triggered strong-field phenomena. We theoretically demonstrate that the numerical observable ionization delay time is a more reliable indicator for characterizing the transition from TI to MPI under different laser parameters. Using non-linear iterative curve fitting algorithm (NICFA), the detected time-dependent probability current of ionized electrons can be decoupled into weighted TI and MPI portions. This enables us to confirm that the observed plateau-like structure in ionization delay time picture at the intermediate ?? originates from the competition between TI and MPI processes. A hybrid quantum and classical approach (HQCA) is developed to evaluate the weights of TI and MPI electrons in good agreement with NICFA result. Moreover, the well separated TI and MPI electrons using HQCA are further propagated classically for mapping their final momentum, which well reproduces the experimental or ab-initio numerical calculated signatures of ionized electron momentum distribution in a rather broad ?? regime.",[],"['Run Wang', 'Qingbin Zhang', 'Dan Li', 'Shengliang Xu', 'Pengkun Cao', 'Yueming Zhou', 'Wei Cao', 'Peixiang Lu']"

These forces reveal information about dynamic processes happening over nanometer length scales due to the nanometer-sized probe tips used in atomic force microscopy. Here, we review in detail several time-resolved EFM techniques based on non-contact atomic force microscopy, elaborating on their specific limitations and challenges. We also introduce a new experimental technique that can resolve time-varying signals well below the oscillation period of the cantilever and compare and contrast it with those previously established.","['atomic force microscopy', 'electrostatic force microscopy', 'ionic transport', 'lithium ion batteries', 'nanotechnology']","['Aaron Mascaro', 'Yoichi Miyahara', 'Tyler Enright', 'Omur E Dagdeviren', 'Peter Gr??tter']"
3,Histone serotonylation is a permissive modification that enhances TFIID binding to H3K4me3.,"Chemical modifications of histones can mediate diverse DNA-templated processes, including gene transcription<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we provide evidence for a class of histone post-translational modification, serotonylation of glutamine, which occurs at position 5 (Q5ser) on histone H3 in organisms that produce serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)). We demonstrate that tissue transglutaminase 2 can serotonylate histone H3 tri-methylated lysine 4 (H3K4me3)-marked nucleosomes, resulting in the presence of combinatorial H3K4me3Q5ser in vivo. H3K4me3Q5ser displays a ubiquitous pattern of tissue expression in mammals, with enrichment observed in brain and gut, two organ systems responsible for the bulk of 5-HT production. Genome-wide analyses of human serotonergic neurons, developing mouse brain and cultured serotonergic cells indicate that H3K4me3Q5ser nucleosomes are enriched in euchromatin, are sensitive to cellular differentiation and correlate with permissive gene expression, phenomena that are linked to the potentiation of TFIID<sup>4-6</sup> interactions with H3K4me3. Cells that??ectopically express a H3 mutant that cannot be serotonylated display significantly altered expression of H3K4me3Q5ser-target loci, which leads to deficits in differentiation.

Whereas static electron densities in single molecules can be imaged in real??space using scanning tunnelling and atomic force microscopy, probing real-time electron motion inside molecules requires ultrafast laser pulses. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical approach to imaging an ultrafast valence electron wave packet in real??time with a time-resolution of a few femtoseconds. We employ a pump-probe-deflect scheme that allows us to prepare an ultrafast wave packet via strong-field ionization and directly image the resulting charge oscillations in the residual ion. This approach extends and overcomes limitations in laser-induced orbital imaging and may enable the real-time imaging of electron dynamics following photoionization such as charge migration and charge transfer processes.",[],"['M K??bel', 'Z Dube', 'A Yu Naumov', 'D M Villeneuve', 'P B Corkum', 'A Staudte']"
3,Tropomyosins: Potential Biomarkers for Urothelial Bladder Cancer.,"Despite the incidence and prevalence of urothelial bladder cancer (UBC), few advances in treatment and diagnosis have been made in recent years. In this review, we discuss potential biomarker candidates: the tropomyosin family of genes, encoded by four loci in the human genome. The expression of these genes is tissue-specific. Tropomyosins are responsible for diverse cellular roles, most notably based upon their interplay with actin to maintain cellular processes, integrity and structure. Tropomyosins exhibit a large variety of splice forms, and altered isoform expression levels have been associated with cancer, including UBC. Notably, tropomyosin isoforms are detectable in urine, offering the potential for non-invasive diagnosis and risk-stratification. This review collates the basic knowledge on tropomyosin and its isoforms, and discusses their relationships with cancer-related phenomena, most specifically in UBC.","['NMIBC', 'TPM', 'tropomyosin', 'urothelial bladder cancer']","['Nada Humayun-Zakaria', 'Roland Arnold', 'Anshita Goel', 'Douglas Ward', 'Stuart Savill', 'Richard T Bryan']"
3,Fragmentation as a novel measure of stability in normalized trajectories of mood and attention measured by ecological momentary assessment.,"Electronic diary data, such as that acquired through Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA), has historically provided novel insights into diverse psychological processes. Analyses of these data typically focus on modeling participant-specific means, variability, and stability. We propose a novel statistical framework to determine participant stability by quantifying fragmentation of standardized trajectories using the following 2-step approach: (1) participant-level EMA scores are normalized, and (2) normalized scores are dichotomized into 2 states, inside and outside a range of 1 standard deviation. Within-participant fragmentation measures were calculated from dichotomized scores and modeled with various covariates. We used this method to study patterns of emotional states and showed that the proposed fragmentation measures differentiate mood disorder subtypes, including Bipolar I (BPI), Bipolar II, and major depressive disorder (MDD) compared with unaffected controls. Fragmentation measures were regressed on the mood disorder subtype, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and mean squared successive difference. The analyses revealed decreased stability (more fragmentation) among those with BPI when inside the participant-specific standard range of attention (?? = 0.09, p = .004) and decreased stability among those with MDD inside the standard range of mood (?? = 0.04, p = .039) and attention (?? = 0.05, p = .017). This work provides an illustration of the clinical significance of EMA in characterizing the stability of mood, attention, or other psychological states that may underlie psychological disorders and phenomena. The application of fragmentation provides a novel statistical approach that can characterize within-participant stability beyond currently available traditional approaches.

3,A coordination-based model for transition metal alloy nanoparticles.,"We present a simple approach for predicting the relative energies of bimetallic nanoparticles spanning a wide-ranging combinatorial space, using only the identity and nearest-neighbor coordination number of individual metal atoms as independent parameters. By performing straightforward metal atom adsorption calculations on surface slab models, we parameterize expressions for the energy of metal atoms as a function of their coordination number in 21 bimetallic pairings of fcc metals. We rigorously establish the transferability of our model by predicting relative energies of a series of nanoparticles across a large number of morphologies, sizes, atomic compositions, and arrangements. The model is particularly accurate in predicting atomic rearrangements at or near the metal surfaces, which is essential for its potential applications when studying segregation phenomena or dynamic processes in heterogeneous catalysis. By rapidly forecasting site stabilities with atomic specificity across generic structural and compositional features, our model is able to reverse engineer thermodynamically feasible motifs of active sites in bimetallic nanoparticles through robust property ??? structure relations.",[],"['Luke T Roling', 'Tej S Choksi', 'Frank Abild-Pedersen']"

The emergence of new colloidal methods for the synthesis of halide perovskite nanocrystals, as well as the interesting characteristics of this new type of material, has attracted the attention of many researchers. This review aims to provide an up-to-date survey of this fast-moving field and will mainly focus on the different colloidal synthesis approaches that have been developed.

3,Analytical model of DOI-induced time bias in ultra-fast scintillation detectors for TOF-PET.,"In positron emission tomography (PET), long crystals ([Formula: see text]20?€?mm) are used to enhance detection efficiency and increase scanner sensitivity. However, for fast time-of-flight (TOF) scanners, this may affect the achievable coincidence time resolution (CTR) due to depth-of-interaction (DOI) induced blur on timing. Currently, the effect of DOI on CTR evaluation with analytical modeling is incorporated using the probability density function (PDF) for attenuation of the annihilation photons with the PDFs of the other scintillation processes. However, we show that the resulting PDF would not describe accurately the variation in timestamps distribution at different DOIs. We propose a new analytical model for the CTR evaluation, which consists of computing a DOI dependent CTR weighted by the DOI probability in coincidence. The CTR was thus defined as the weighted root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the DOI-wise variance and bias in order to explicitly describe the positioning bias induced by coincident annihilation photons at different DOIs. The effect of DOI bias on CTR was investigated by using four classic estimators found in the literature, each applied on contemporary scintillation detectors and nearly ideal detectors. A limited difference in the calculated CTR was found for typical scintillation detectors when assessing RMSE with and without DOI time offset correction. This was expected since the DOI bias remains negligible against other phenomena in such case. However, the difference becomes significant for nearly ideal scintillation detectors, where optimal CTR would only be attainable with DOI correction. For these nearly ideal cases, the revised model has better predictive power since the DOI time offset correction is included. Investigation with analytical approaches for realistically achievable ultra-fast CTR in TOF-PET detectors should be performed with a model that genuinely takes into account the DOI effect. We show that the proposed model is a valid candidate for such a task.",[],"['Maxime Toussaint', 'Francis Loignon-Houle', 'Jean-Pierre Dussault', 'Roger Lecomte']"
3,Quantifying heterogeneity of stochastic gene expression.,"The heterogeneity of stochastic gene expression, which refers to the temporal fluctuation in a gene product and its cell-to-cell variation, has attracted considerable interest from biologists, physicists, and mathematicians. The dynamics of protein production and degradation have been modeled as random processes with transition probabilities. However, there is a gap between theory and phenomena, particularly in terms of analytical formulation and parameter estimation. In this study, we propose a theoretical framework in which we present a basic model of a gene regulatory system, derive a steady-state solution, and provide a Bayesian approach for estimating the model parameters from single-cell experimental data. The proposed framework is demonstrated to be applicable for various scales of single-cell experiments at both the mRNA and protein levels and is useful for comparing kinetic parameters across species, genomes, and cell strains.","['Lac operon', 'Master equation', 'Metropolis algorithm', 'Stochastic process']","['Keita Iida', 'Nobuaki Obata', 'Yoshitaka Kimura']"
3,Conducting Super-Hydrophobic Thin Film for Electric Heating Applications.,"Frost presents a serious problem for the human environment, resulting in such phenomena as downed power lines, damaged crops and stalled aircraft. In addition, frost and ice accumulation significantly decrease the performance of ships, wind turbines, and HVAC systems with high failure risk. Super-hydrophobic (SH) surface can be an appropriate solution for frost problems, due to its anti-icing properties that can prevent ice nucleation on the surface. In addition, in the case of conducting SH surface using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a filler, it can form an excellent heating unit, owing to the resistive heating effect. The purpose of this study is to produce a large-area conducting SH film that can prevent ice nucleus and remove ice formation rapidly. High aspect ratio carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a conducting filler and adhesive polymer resin as a binder were used to form coating layer. In addition, silica particles (~7 nm) were used to stabilize nano-size roughness of the SH surface. Wet and dry etching processes were used on the substrate to improve wettability and to produce organic functional groups. To evaluate the de-icing effect, the fabricated SH surface was rapidly heated to 150 ??C by applying voltage.",[],"['Myung-Hyun Park', 'Ji-Hwan Ha', 'Moonwoo La', 'Young-Bae Ko', 'Dongearn Kim', 'Sung-Hoon Park']"
3,Spontaneous water adsorption-desorption oscillations in mesoporous thin films.,"Understanding fluid transport and phase changes in nanopore structures is of great interest to many application fields, from energy conversion to water harvesting. This work discusses the spontaneous oscillations of the water saturation of mesoporous thin films, in the zone adjacent to a sessile water drop, at ambient conditions. The wetting-front dynamics onto the film is described by considering three coexisting phenomena: infiltration from the water drop, condensation from air vapor, and evaporation to the ambient. It was found that the oscillations follow spontaneous condensation-evaporation imbalances, which are governed by the hysteretic character of the adsorption-desorption behavior of the mesoporous material. The outcomes of this work provide insights on the complex interplay between water and nanopore structures, which has practical implications for the handling of humid microenvironments in lab-on-a-chip technology, as well as for many processes that take part of the cycle of water in nature.","['Complex dynamics', 'Condensation', 'Evaporation', 'Nanopores', 'Saturation']","['Ra??l Urteaga', 'Magal??

3,Study on the pathological and biomedical characteristics of spinal cord injury by confocal Raman microspectral imaging.,"Confocal Raman microspectral imaging (CRMI) in combination with multivariate analysis was used to study pathological progression after spinal cord injury (SCI). By establishing moderate contusion in rat models, ex vivo longitudinal spinal cord tissue sections were prepared for microspectroscopic analysis. Comparative studies were then performed to determine the pathological distinctions among before injury (BI), one day post-injury (1 DPI), seven days post-injury (7 DPI), and 14?€?days post-injury (14 DPI) groups. Multivariate analysis algorithms, including K-mean cluster analysis (KCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were conducted to highlight biochemical and structural variations after tissue damage. It is confirmed that typical spectral features and profiles can illustrate some fundamental and significant pathological processes post-injury, such as neuron apoptosis, hemorrhage, demyelination, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) upregulation. Further, by establishing spectra-structure correlations, the reconstructed spectral images revealed some minute and important morphological characteristics following tissue injury, such as glial scar formation surrounding the cavity structure. The observed spectral phenomena also provide a detailed view on relevant pathobiological factors, which are involved in the spread of secondary damage after traumatic spinal cord injury. Our findings not only provide a spectral perspective to the well-known cellular mechanisms underlying SCI, but further provide a sound basis for developing real-time Raman methodologies to evaluate the prognostic factors and therapeutic results of SCI.","['Confocal Raman microspectral imaging', 'Multivariate analysis algorithms', 'Pathological progression', 'Spinal cord injury']","['Jie Li', 'Zhuowen Liang', 'Shuang Wang', 'Zhe Wang', 'Xu Zhang', 'Xueyu Hu', 'Kaige Wang', 'Qingli He', 'Jintao Bai']"
3,Photorespiration is complemented by cyclic electron flow and the alternative oxidase pathway to optimize photosynthesis and protect against abiotic stress.,"Optimization of photosynthetic performance and protection against abiotic stress are essential to sustain plant growth. Photorespiratory metabolism can help plants to adapt to abiotic stress. The beneficial role of photorespiration under abiotic stress is further strengthened by cyclic electron flow (CEF) and alternative oxidase (AOX) pathways. We have attempted to critically assess the literature on the responses of these three phenomena-photorespiration, CEF and AOX, to different stress situations. We emphasize that photorespiration is the key player to protect photosynthesis and upregulates CEF as well as AOX. Then these three processes work in coordination to protect the plants against photoinhibition and maintain an optimal redox state in the cell, while providing ATP for metabolism and protein repair. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated during photorespiratory metabolism seems to be an important signal to upregulate CEF or AOX. Further experiments are necessary to identify the signals originating from CEF or AOX to modulate photorespiration. The mutants deficient in CEF or AOX or both could be useful in this regard. The mutual interactions between CEF and AOX, so as to keep their complementarity, are also to be examined further.","['Alternative oxidase', 'Chloroplasts', 'Glycine decarboxylase', 'Photoinhibition', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Redox homeostasis']","['Bobba Sunil', 'Deepak Saini', 'Ramesh B Bapatla', 'Vetcha Aswani', 'Agepati S Raghavendra']"
3,Nonequilibrium Lyapunov function and a fluctuation relation for stochastic systems: Poisson-representation approach.,"We present a statistical physics framework for the description of nonlinear nonequilibrium stochastic processes, modeled via a chemical master equation, in the weak-noise limit. Using the Poisson-representation approach and applying the large-deviation principle, we first solve the master equation. Then we use the notion of the nonequilibrium free energy to derive an integral fluctuation relation for nonlinear nonequilibrium systems under feedback control. We point out that the free energy as well as some functionals can serve as a nonequilibrium Lyapunov function which has an important property to decay monotonously to its minimal value at all times. The Poisson-representation technique is illustrated via exact stochastic treatment of biophysical processes, such as bacterial chemosensing and molecular evolution.

3,Post-amputation pain is associated with the recall of an impaired body representation in dreams-results from a nation-wide survey on limb amputees.,"The experience of post-amputation pain such as phantom limb pain (PLP) and residual limb pain (RLP), is a common consequence of limb amputation, and its presence has negative effects on a person's well-being. The continuity hypothesis of dreams suggests that the presence of such aversive experiences in the waking state should be reflected in dream content, with the recalled body representation reflecting a cognitive proxy of negative impact. In the present study, we epidemiologically assessed the presence of post-amputation pain and other amputation-related information as well as recalled body representation in dreams in a sample of 3,234 unilateral limb amputees. Data on the site and time of amputation, residual limb length, prosthesis use, lifetime prevalence of mental disorders, presence of post-amputation pain, and presence of non-painful phantom phenomena were included in logistic regression analyses using recalled body representation in dreams (impaired, intact, no memory) as dependent variable. The effects of age, sex, and frequency of dream recall were controlled for. About 22% of the subjects indicated that they were not able to remember their body representation in dreams, another 24% of the amputees recalled themselves as always intact, and only a minority of less than 3% recalled themselves as always impaired. Almost 35% of the amputees dreamed of themselves in a mixed fashion. We found that lower-limb amputation as well as the presence of PLP and RLP was positively associated with the recall of an impaired body representation in dreams. The presence of non-painful phantom phenomena, however, had no influence. These results complement previous findings and indicate complex interactions of physical body appearance and mental body representation, probably modulated by distress in the waking state. The findings are discussed against the background of alterations in cognitive processes after amputation and hypotheses suggesting an innate body model.

3,LRX Proteins Play a Crucial Role in Pollen Grain and Pollen Tube Cell Wall Development.,"Leu-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are chimeric proteins containing an N-terminal Leu-rich repeat (LRR) and a C-terminal extensin domain. LRXs are involved in cell wall formation in vegetative tissues and required for plant growth. However, the nature of their role in these cellular processes remains to be elucidated. Here, we used a combination of molecular techniques, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize mutants of pollen-expressed <i>LRXs</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i><i>thaliana</i>). Mutations in multiple pollen-expressed <i>lrx</i> genes cause severe defects in pollen germination and pollen tube growth, resulting in a reduced seed set. Physiological experiments demonstrate that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability partially suppresses the pollen tube growth defects, suggesting that LRX proteins influence Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related processes. Furthermore, we show that LRX protein localizes to the cell wall, and its LRR-domain (which likely mediates protein-protein interactions) is associated with the plasma membrane. Mechanical analyses by cellular force microscopy and finite element method-based modeling revealed significant changes in the material properties of the cell wall and the fine-tuning of cellular biophysical parameters in the mutants compared to the wild type. The results indicate that LRX proteins might play a role in cell wall-plasma membrane communication, influencing cell wall formation and cellular mechanics.",[],"['Tohnyui Ndinyanka Fabrice', 'Hannes Vogler', 'Christian Draeger', 'Gautam Munglani', 'Shibu Gupta', 'Aline G Herger', 'Paul Knox', 'Ueli Grossniklaus', 'Christoph Ringli']"
3,The Molecular Basis of Noncanonical Bacterial Morphology.,"Bacteria come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. The true picture of bacterial morphological diversity is likely skewed due to an experimental focus on pathogens and industrially relevant organisms. Indeed, most of the work elucidating the genes and molecular processes involved in maintaining bacterial morphology has been limited to rod- or coccal-shaped model systems. The mechanisms of shape evolution, the molecular processes underlying diverse shapes and growth modes, and how individual cells can dynamically modulate their shape are just beginning to be revealed. Here we discuss recent work aimed at advancing our knowledge of shape diversity and uncovering the molecular basis for shape generation in noncanonical and morphologically complex bacteria.","['bacterial shape', 'morphological engineering', 'morphology', 'peptidoglycan', 'pleomorphism']","['Paul D Caccamo', 'Yves V Brun']"
3,Transfer of the epoxidation of soybean oil from batch to flow chemistry guided by cost and environmental issues.,"The simple transfer of established chemical production processes from batch to flow chemistry does not automatically result in more sustainable ones. Detailed process understanding and the motivation to scrutinize known process conditions are necessary factors for success. Although the focus is usually ""only"" on intensifying transport phenomena to operate under intrinsic kinetics, there is also a large intensification potential in chemistry under harsh conditions and in the specific design of flow processes. Such an understanding and proposed processes are required at an early stage of process design because decisions on the best-suited tools and parameters required to convert green engineering concepts into practice-typically with little chance of substantial changes later-are made during this period. Herein, we present a holistic and interdisciplinary process design approach that combines the concept of novel process windows with process modeling, simulation, and simplified cost and lifecycle assessment for the deliberate development of a cost-competitive and environmentally sustainable alternative to an existing production process for epoxidized soybean oil.",[],"['Dana Kralisch', 'Ina Streckmann', 'Denise Ott', 'Ulich Krtschil', 'Elio Santacesaria', 'Martino Di Serio', 'Vincenzo Russo', 'Lucrezia De Carlo', 'Walter Linhart', 'Engelbert Christian', 'Bruno Cortese', 'Mart H J M de Croon', 'Volker Hessel']"
3,Reproduction Differentially Affects Trabecular Bone Depending on Its Mechanical Versus Metabolic Role.,"During pregnancy and lactation, the maternal skeleton provides calcium for fetal/infant growth, resulting in substantial bone loss, which partially recovers after weaning. However, the amount of bone that is lost and the extent of post-weaning recovery are highly variable among different skeletal sites, and, despite persistent alterations in bone structure at some locations, reproductive history does not increase postmenopausal fracture risk. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesized that the degree of reproductive bone loss/recovery at trabecular sites may vary depending on the extent to which the trabecular compartment is involved in the bone's load-bearing function. Using a rat model, we quantified the proportion of the load carried by the trabeculae, as well as the extent of reproductive bone loss and recovery, at two distinct skeletal sites: the tibia and lumbar vertebra. Both sites underwent significant bone loss during pregnancy and lactation, which was partially recovered post-weaning. However, the extent of the deterioration and the resumption of trabecular load-bearing capacity after weaning varied substantially. Tibial trabecular bone, which bore a low proportion of the total applied load, underwent dramatic and irreversible microstructural deterioration during reproduction. Meanwhile, vertebral trabecular bone bore a greater fraction of the load, underwent minimal deterioration in microarchitecture, and resumed its full load-bearing capacity after weaning. Because pregnancy and lactation are physiological processes, the distinctive responses to these natural events among different skeletal sites may help to elucidate the extent of the trabecular bone's structural versus metabolic functions.",[],"['Chantal M J de Bakker', 'Wei-Ju Tseng', 'Yihan Li', 'Hongbo Zhao', 'Allison R Altman-Singles', 'Yonghoon Jeong', 'Juhanna Robberts', 'Lin Han', 'Do-Gyoon Kim', 'X Sherry Liu']"
3,Micropipette force probe to quantify single-cell force generation: application to T-cell activation.,"In response to engagement of surface molecules, cells generate active forces that regulate many cellular processes. Developing tools that permit gathering mechanical and morphological information on these forces is of the utmost importance. Here we describe a new technique, the micropipette force probe, that uses a micropipette as a flexible cantilever that can aspirate at its tip a bead that is coated with molecules of interest and is brought in contact with the cell. This technique simultaneously allows tracking the resulting changes in cell morphology and mechanics as well as measuring the forces generated by the cell. To illustrate the power of this technique, we applied it to the study of human primary T lymphocytes (T-cells). It allowed the fine monitoring of pushing and pulling forces generated by T-cells in response to various activating antibodies and bending stiffness of the micropipette. We further dissected the sequence of mechanical and morphological events occurring during T-cell activation to model force generation and to reveal heterogeneity in the cell population studied. We also report the first measurement of the changes in Young's modulus of T-cells during their activation, showing that T-cells stiffen within the first minutes of the activation process.",[],"['Anna Sawicka', 'Avin Babataheri', 'St??phanie Dogniaux', 'Abdul I Barakat', 'David Gonzalez-Rodriguez', 'Claire Hivroz', 'Julien Husson']"
3,An integrative appraisal of mechano-electric feedback mechanisms in the heart.,"Mechanically-induced alterations in cardiac electrophysiology are referred to as mechano-electric feedback (MEF), and play an important role in electrical regulation of cardiac performance. The influence of mechanical stress and strain on electrophysiology has been investigated at all levels, however the role of MEF in arrhythmia remains poorly understood. During the normal contraction of the heart, mechano-sensitive processes are an implicit component of cardiac activity. Under abnormal mechanical events, stretch-activated mechanisms may contribute to local or global changes in electrophysiology (EP). While such mechanisms have been hypothesised to be involved in mechanically-initiated arrhythmias, the details of these mechanisms and their importance remain elusive. We assess the theoretical role of stretch mechanisms using coupled models of cellular electrophysiology and sarcomere contraction dynamics. Using models of single ventricular myocytes, we first investigated the potential MEF contributions of stretch-activated currents (SAC), and stretch-induced myofilament calcium release, to test how strain and fibrosis may alter cellular electrophysiology. For all models investigated, SACs were alone not sufficient to create a pro-arrhythmic perturbation of the action potential with stretch. However, when combined with stretch-induced myofilament calcium release, the action potential could be shortened depending on the timing of the strain. This effect was highly model dependent, with a canine epicardial EP model being the most sensitive. These model results suggest that known mechanisms of mechano-electric coupling in cardiac myocyte may be sufficient to be pro-arrhythmic, but only in combination and under specific strain patterns.","['Arrhythmia', 'Computational modelling', 'Human electromechanical model', 'Mechano-electric feedback']","['Viviane Timmermann', 'Lars A Dejgaard', 'Kristina H Haugaa', 'Andrew G Edwards', 'Joakim Sundnes', 'Andrew D McCulloch', 'Samuel T Wall']"
3,Cytokines and Chemokines as Biomarkers of Future Asthma.,"Antenatal and preschool factors are key in determining the progression to pre-school wheeze and eosinophilic school age asthma. The conventional view of eosinophilic asthma is that airway inflammation is the fundamental underlying abnormality, and airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness are secondary; in fact, these three are parallel processes. Very early structural changes, independent of inflammation and infection, are associated with early airway hyper-responsiveness and later adverse respiratory outcomes. There is a bidirectional relationship between structural airway wall changes and airway inflammation, with airway contraction <i>per se</i> leading to the release of growth factors, and inflammatory pathways promoting airway remodeling. Early viral infection (and increasingly being appreciated, bacterial infection) is important in wheeze outcomes. There is evidence of abnormal immune function including cytokine release before the onset of viral infections. However, viral infections may also have prolonged effects on the host immune system, and the evidence for beneficial and adverse effects of viral infection is conflicting. In older children and adults, asthmatic epithelial cells show impaired interferon responses to viral infection, but only in the presence of uncontrolled type 2 inflammation, implying these are secondary phenomena. There are also compelling data relating the innate immune system to later asthma and atopy, and animal studies suggest that the effects of a high endotoxin, microbiologically diverse environment may be modulated via the epithelial alarmin IL-33. Whereas, previously only viral infection was thought to be important, early bacterial colonization of the upper airway is coming to the fore, associated with a mixed pattern of TH1/TH2/TH17 cytokine secretion, and adverse long term outcomes. Bacterial colonization is probably a marker of a subtle immune deficiency, rather than directly causal. The airway and gut microbiome critically impacts the development of Type 2 inflammatory responses. However, Type 2 inflammatory cytokines, which are critical both to progression from pre-school wheeze to eosinophilic asthma, and sustaining the eosinophilic asthmatic state, are not implicated in the very early development of the disease. Taken together, the evidence is that the earliest cytokine and chemokine signals will come from the study of bronchial epithelial cell function and their interactions with viruses and the microbiome.","['airway hyper-responsiveness', 'airway remodeling', 'allergy', 'bacterial infection', 'eosinophilia']",['Andrew Bush']
3,Plausible role of bacterial toxin anti-toxin system in persister cell formation and elimination.,"Although, a large proportion of pathogenic bacteria gets eliminated from hosts after antibiotic treatment, a fraction of population confronts against such effects and undergoes growth arrest to form persisters. Persistence in bacteria is a dormant physiological state where cells escape the effects of antimicrobials as well as other host immune defences without any genetic mutations. The state of dormancy is achieved through various complex phenomena and it is known that, a gene pair named as toxin-anti toxin (TA) acts as key player of persister cell formation where the toxin is activated either stochastically or after an environmental insult, thereby silencing the physiological processes. However, the controversial role of TA modules in persister cell formation has also been documented with reasonable clarity. Persisters may revert back from state of quiescence and regrow when conditions become favourable for their propagation. Therefore, elimination of dormant bacteria is crucial and currently, research interest is highly focussed on developing several anti-persister strategies that may kill persister bacteria by targeting different molecules. It is worth examining these targets to develop appropriate therapeutic interventions against bacterial infections and it is believed that earmarking TA system can be a novel approach for resuscitation of persisters. In this review, we discussed the role of TA modules in mediating persistence with highlighting on the debatable issues regarding contribution of these modules in dormant bacteria formation. Further, we discussed if these modules in bacteria can be targeted for successful elimination of dormant persister cells. This article is protected by copyright.

3,Motor Learning.,"Motor learning encompasses a wide range of phenomena, ranging from relatively low-level mechanisms for maintaining calibration of our movements, to making high-level cognitive decisions about how to act in a novel situation. We survey the major existing approaches to characterizing motor learning at both the behavioral and neural level. In particular, we critically review two long-standing paradigms used in motor learning research-adaptation and sequence learning. We discuss the extent to which these paradigms can be considered models of motor skill acquisition, defined as the incremental improvement in our ability to rapidly select and then precisely execute appropriate actions, and conclude that they fall short of doing so. We then discuss two classes of emerging research paradigms-learning of arbitrary visuomotor mappings de??novo and learning to execute movements with improved acuity-that more effectively address the acquisition of motor skill. Future work will be needed to determine the degree to which laboratory-based studies of skill, as described in this review, will relate to true expertise, which is likely dependent on the effects of practice on multiple cognitive processes that go beyond traditional sensorimotor neural architecture. ?? 2019 American Physiological Society.

3,Nanomaterials for Drug Delivery to the Central Nervous System.,"The intricate microstructure of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is responsible for the accurate intrinsic regulation of the central nervous system (CNS), in terms of neuronal pathophysiological phenomena. Any disruption to the BBB can be associated with genetic defects triggering or with local antigenic invasion (either neurotoxic blood-derived metabolites and residues or microbial pathogens). Such events can be further related to systemic inflammatory or immune disorders, which can subsequently initiate several neurodegenerative pathways. Any degenerative process related to the CNS results in progressive and yet incurable impairment of neuronal cells. Since these particular neurons are mostly scanty or incapable of self-repair and regeneration processes, there is tremendous worldwide interest in novel therapeutic strategies for such specific conditions. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD, respectively) are conditions found worldwide, being considered the most rampant degenerative pathologies related to CNS. The current therapy of these conditions, including both clinical and experimental approaches, mainly enables symptom management and subsidiary neuronal protection and even less disease regression. Still, a thorough understanding of the BBB pathophysiology and an accurate molecular and sub-molecular management of AD and PD will provide beneficial support for more specific and selective therapy. Since nanotechnology-derived materials and devices proved attractive and efficient platforms for modern biomedicine (including detection, imaging, diagnosis, medication, restoration and regeneration), a particular approach for AD and PD management relies on nanoparticle-based therapy.

A Case Study with [I@V<sub>18</sub>O<sub>42</sub>] <sup>q-</sup> ( q = 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13).","A series of stable reduction-oxidation states of the cagelike [I@V<sup>IV</sup><sub>x</sub>V<sup>V</sup><sub>18- x</sub>O<sub>42</sub>]<sup>5- x</sup> polyoxovanadate (POV) with x = 8, 10, 12, 16, and 18 were studied with density functional theory and molecular dynamics to gain insight into the structural and electron distribution characteristics of these metal-oxo clusters and to analyze the charge/redox-dependent assemblage processes in water and acetonitrile (MeCN) solutions. The calculations show that the interplay between the POV redox state (molecular charge) and the solvent polarity, countercation size, and hydrophilicity (or hydrophobicity) controls the POV agglomeration phenomena, which substantially differ between aqueous and MeCN media. In MeCN, agglomeration is more pronounced for intermediate-charged POVs, whereas in water, the lowest-charged POVs and organic countercations tend to agglomerate into a microphase. Tests made on wet MeCN show diminished agglomeration with respect to pure MeCN. Simulations with alkali countercations in water show that only the highest-charged POV can form agglomerates. The herein presented theoretical investigation aims to support experimental studies of POVs in the field of functional nanomaterials and surfaces, where controlled molecular deposition from the liquid phase onto solid??substrates??requires knowledge about the features of these metal-oxo clusters in discrete solutions.",[],"['Albert Sol??-Daura', 'Almudena Notario-Est??vez', 'Jorge J Carb??', 'Josep M Poblet', 'Coen de Graaf', 'Kirill Yu Monakhov', 'Xavier L??pez']"
3,Low shear stress induces ERK nuclear localization and YAP activation to control the proliferation of breast cancer cells.,"Micro-environmental regulation of cancer cell malignancy is one of the most basic cancer life phenomena. However, the study of cellular response to microenvironment has been long focused on signal processes mediated by various chemical factors and their receptors, the study of mechanical forces, another key environmental factor, has been less studied. In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the physiological and pathological significance of mechanical microenvironment. However, it is still not clear how cells perceive environmental changes and the signal pathways that regulate cell physiological activities. In this study, we identified that low shear stress (LSS) significantly promoted breast cancer cell proliferation. The proliferation was closely associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Yes-associated protein (YAP). Inhibition of ERK or YAP both abolished the LSS-induced proliferation activity of cancer cells. LSS induced ERK phosphorylation and YAP activations, which suggested the involvement of ERK and YAP under LSS treatment. Under LSS, ERK inhibitor U0126 decreased both active YAP and ERK expressions, while YAP inhibitor verteporfin failed to decrease ERK phosphorylation. Further study confirmed that ERK translocated to nucleus which showed an active state of ERK in LSS-treated group. LSS with verteporfin group showed no differences with LSS-treated group which confirmed ERK and YAP an upstream-downstream cascade. The above results demonstrated that LSS can promote breast cancer cell proliferation through ERK-YAP activation. These results not only highlight a new means of understanding mechanical transmission to cytoplasm mechanisms but also serve as a new basis for developing drug delivery systems for breast cancer treatment.","['ERK', 'Low shear stress', 'Mechanotransduction', 'Nucleus translocation', 'YAP']","['Xiang Qin', 'Ji Li', 'Jinghui Sun', 'Lingling Liu', 'Dingchuan Chen', 'Yiyao Liu']"
3,Static decontamination of oil-based drill cuttings with pressurized hot water using response surface methodology.,"Separating organic pollutants from oil-based drill cuttings (OBDC) is the current trend for its safe disposal. In this study, pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) was adapted to decontaminate OBDC for the first time. Two typical OBDC samples, i.e., diesel-based drill cuttings (OBDC-A) and white oil-based drill cuttings (OBDC-B), were statically extracted in a homemade batch autoclave. Response surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite design (CCD) was applied to investigate the effects and interactive effects of three independent operating parameters (temperature, extraction time, and water volume) and to ultimately optimize the PHWE process. The results suggested that temperature is the dominant parameter, followed by water volume and extraction time. Interactive effects among the three parameters are present in the PHWE of OBDC-A but absent in the PHWE of OBDC-B. The suitable conditions for the effective PHWE of OBDC-A were found to be a temperature of 284-300????C, water volume of 15-35??ml, and extraction time of 20-60??min. The corresponding conditions were 237-300????C, 15-35??ml, and 20-60??min for the PHWE of OBDC-B. These different phenomena are caused by the different characteristics of the two OBDC samples. All of the polynomial models obtained from the RSM experiments are very valid and can adequately describe the relationship among the three independent operating parameters and responses. The experimental results also confirmed that PHWE is a more efficient separation technique for decontaminating OBDC than single organic solvent extraction or low-temperature thermal desorption because PHWE integrates the advantages of both these processes.","['Hazardous solid waste', 'Oily sludge', 'Petroleum contamination', 'Shale gas', 'Waste drill fluids']","['Zhong Chen', 'Dongyuan Li', 'Kun Tong', 'Zeliang Chen', 'Hongzhen Chen', 'Qiao Chen', 'Yuanjian Xu']"
3,Primary cultured neuronal networks and type 2 diabetes model mouse fatty liver tissues in aqueous liquid observed by atmospheric SEM (ASEM): Staining preferences of metal solutions.,"Neural networking, including axon targeting and synapse formation, is the basis of various brain functions, including memory and learning. Diabetes-mellitus affects peripheral nerves and is known to cause fatty liver disease. Electron microscopy (EM) provides the resolution required to observe changes in fine subcellular structures caused by such physiological and pathological processes, but samples are observed in vacuum. Environmental capsule EM can directly observe cells in a more natural aqueous environment, but the size-limited capsules restrict cell culturability. The recently developed atmospheric scanning electron microscope (ASEM) has an open, 35?€?mm sample dish, allowing the culture of primary cells, including neurons, on the electron-transparent film window fabricated in its base. The system's inverted scanning electron microscope observes aldehyde-fixed cells or tissues from below through the silicon nitride film; the optical microscope located above allows direct correlation of fluorescence labeling. To observe fixed biological samples, damage due to low dose electron radiation is minimized in three ways. First, knock on damage that pushes out atoms is decreased by the low accelerating voltage of 10-30?€?kV. Second, increased radical generation due to the decreased acceleration voltage is countered by the addition of a radical scavenger, glucose or ascorbic acid, to the sample solution. Third, the large volume (max. 2?€?ml) of aqueous buffer surrounding the sample has a high specific heat capacity, minimizing the temperature increase caused by irradiation. Using ASEM, we have developed protocols for heavy metal staining in solution to selectively visualize intracellular structures. Various EM staining methods served as a starting point. Uranyl acetate preferably stains proteins and nucleic acid, and prior tannic acid treatment enhances membranes. Osmium tetroxide is suggested to enhance lipids, especially oil droplets. Imaging primary-culture neurons stained with platinum blue or uranyl acetate revealed growth cones, synapses, and 50-500?€?nm spines, together with neurite backbones and their associated structures. Correlative microscopy with immuno-fluorescence labeling suggested that these were mainly microtubule associated objects; some showed signs of a fission process and were, thus, possibly mitochondria. Liver tissue excised from the ob/ob type 2 diabetes model mouse, was stained with osmium tetroxide and observed using ASEM. Swollen bright balls occupied a large area of the cytoplasm and could be distinguished from vacuoles, suggesting that they are oil droplets. In some of the images, oil-like droplets were pressing surrounding structures, including sinusoids, significant for blood circulation in the liver. Based on these studies, ASEM combined with metal staining methods promises to allow the study of various mesoscopic-scale phenomena of cells and tissues immersed in natural aqueous environment in the near future. The quick nature of ASEM could facilitate not only the precise imaging for neuroscience but also the diagnosis of fatty liver disease and related diseases.","['Atmospheric scanning electron microscope', 'CLEM', 'Correlative light-electron microscopy', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Neuron primary culture', 'Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis diagnosis']","['Chikara Sato', 'Toshiko Yamazawa', 'Akiko Ohtani', 'Yuusuke Maruyama', 'Nassirhadjy Memtily', 'Mari Sato', 'Yuri Hatano', 'Takashi Shiga', 'Tatsuhiko Ebihara']"
3,Effects of elevated ground-level ozone on paddy soil bacterial community and assembly mechanisms across four years.,"It is well known that elevated ground-level ozone (eO<sub>3</sub>) poses a threat to the ecosystem. Little knowledge about the underground variables, especially on soil microorganisms, however, has been revealed. Such knowledge will tremendously help to advance our understanding of the correlation between ecosystems and climate change, as well as our ability to predict future trajectory. For this purpose, we have collected soil DNA samples (eO<sub>3</sub> vs. Ambient, each having 36 samples) over four years. Our results have verified the temporal responses and the underlying assembly mechanisms of the paddy bacterial community to eO<sub>3</sub>. Contrary to the widespread consensus, it was found that eO<sub>3</sub> stimulated bacterial alpha diversities. The higher complexity and the centralization of the co-occurrence network of the bacterial community suggested that this stimulation was due to a microbial survival strategy in response to the limited resources, which led to the instability of the community. Furthermore, the observed slower temporal turnover of the bacterial community composition in response to eO<sub>3</sub> was due to the decreased deterministic processes derived from plants, which implied that eO<sub>3</sub> disrupted the coordination between soil microorganisms and rice crop. All above phenomena provided novel insights into the adverse influences of eO<sub>3</sub> on the soil microbial community. If O<sub>3</sub> concentration increases continuously, the adverse effects will be aggravated and harm the related ecological functions.","['Bacterial community', 'Community assembly', 'Diversity', 'Elevated ground-level ozone']","['Jianwei Zhang', 'Haoye Tang', 'Jianguo Zhu', 'Xiangui Lin', 'Youzhi Feng']"
3,Bidirectional regulation of osteogenic differentiation by the FOXO subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors in mammalian MSCs.,"Through loss- and gain-of-function experiments in knockout and transgenic mice, Forkhead box O (FOXO) family transcription factors have been demonstrated to play essential roles in many biological processes, including cellular proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Osteogenic differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts is a well-organized process that is carefully guided and characterized by various factors, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), ??-catenin, osteocalcin (OCN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Accumulating evidence suggests multiple interactions among FOXO members and the differentiation regulatory factors listed above, resulting in an enhancement or inhibition of osteogenesis in different stages of osteogenic differentiation. To systematically and integrally understand the role of FOXOs in osteogenic differentiation and explain the contrary phenomena observed in vitro and in vivo, we herein summarized FOXO-interacting differentiation regulatory genes/factors and following alterations in differentiation. The underlying mechanism was further discussed on the basis of binding types, sites, phases and the consequent downstream transcriptional alterations of interactions among FOXOs and differentiation regulatory factors. Interestingly, a bidirectional effect of FOXOs on balancing osteogenic differentiation was discovered in MSCs. Moreover, FOXO factors are reported to be activated or suppressed by several context-dependent signalling inputs during differentiation, and the underlying molecular basis may offer new drug development targets for treatments of bone formation defect diseases.","['FOXO', 'mesenchymal stem cells', 'microRNA', 'osteogenic differentiation', 'post-translational modification']","['Duanjing Chen', 'Yuanyuan Gong', 'Ling Xu', 'Mengjiao Zhou', 'Jie Li', 'Jinlin Song']"
3,Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy of aqueous micellar electrolyte solutions: A novel application to infer Dukhin number and zeta potential of a micelle.,"The complex permittivities of aqueous SDS solutions, with and without the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl), are measured in the frequency range from 200 MHz to 14 GHz. The SDS concentrations are chosen such that the SDS molecules aggregate to micelles. In this frequency range, the measured spectra allow for the identification of two different relaxation processes. That is, the relaxation of the water molecules at frequencies above 1 GHz and the micellar relaxation at frequencies lower than 1 GHz. It is found that the addition of NaCl to the system mostly affects the micellar relaxation process. In detail, the time constant as well as the amplitude of the relaxation decrease by adding NaCl. These effects are attributed to the change in the solution conductivity that changes the properties of the micelle's electrical double layer. We also extract the Dukhin number of the micelles as a function of surfactant and electrolyte content from the measurements. The Dukhin number is a dimensionless group that describes the influence of the surface conductivity on a phenomena. A regression between Dukhin numbers and free sodium ions is found so that all data collapses on a single curve independent of the surfactant concentration. The surface conductivity is a manifestation of the electrical double layer and we use the Bikerman equation to infer the zeta potential of the micelles. Comparison to literature data shows very good agreement and proves that dielectric relaxation spectroscopy can be engaged to infer the zeta potential of micelles.

3,Point process models for localization and interdependence of punctate cellular structures.,"Accurate representations of cellular organization for multiple eukaryotic cell types are required for creating predictive models of dynamic cellular function. To this end, we have previously developed the CellOrganizer platform, an open source system for generative modeling of cellular components from microscopy images. CellOrganizer models capture the inherent heterogeneity in the spatial distribution, size, and quantity of different components among a cell population. Furthermore, CellOrganizer can generate quantitatively realistic synthetic images that reflect the underlying cell population. A current focus of the project is to model the complex, interdependent nature of organelle localization. We built upon previous work on developing multiple non-parametric models of organelles or structures that show punctate patterns. The previous models described the relationships between the subcellular localization of puncta and the positions of cell and nuclear membranes and microtubules. We extend these models to consider the relationship to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and to consider the relationship between the positions of different puncta of the same type. Our results do not suggest that the punctate patterns we examined are dependent on ER position or inter- and intra-class proximity. With these results, we built classifiers to update previous assignments of proteins to one of 11 patterns in three distinct cell lines. Our generative models demonstrate the ability to construct statistically accurate representations of puncta localization from simple cellular markers in distinct cell types, capturing the complex phenomena of cellular structure interaction with little human input. This protocol represents a novel approach to vesicular protein annotation, a field that is often neglected in high-throughput microscopy. These results suggest that spatial point process models provide useful insight with respect to the spatial dependence between cellular structures. ?? 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.","['generative models', 'pattern recognition', 'spatial point processes', 'subcellular location', 'systems biology']","['Ying Li', 'Timothy D Majarian', 'Armaghan W Naik', 'Gregory R Johnson', 'Robert F Murphy']"
3,A novel meta-analysis method exploiting consistency of high-throughput experiments.,"Large-scale biological experiments provide snapshots into the huge number of processes running in parallel within the organism. These processes depend on a large number of (hidden) (epi)genetic, social, environmental and other factors that are out of experimentalists' control. This makes it extremely difficult to identify the dominant processes and the elements involved in them based on a single experiment. It is therefore desirable to use multiple sets of experiments targeting the same phenomena while differing in some experimental parameters (hidden or controllable). Although such datasets are becoming increasingly common, their analysis is complicated by the fact that the various biological elements could be influenced by different sets of factors.The central hypothesis of this article is that biologically related elements and processes are affected by changes in similar ways while unrelated ones are affected differently. Thus, the relations between related elements are more consistent across experiments. The method outlined here looks for groups of elements with robust intra-group relationships in the expectation that they are related. The major groups of elements may be identified in this way. The strengths of relationships per se are not valued, just their consistency. This represents a completely novel and unutilized source of information. In the analysis of time course microarray experiments, I found cell cycle- and ribosome-related genes to be the major groups. Despite not looking for these groups in particular, the identification of these genes rivals that of methods designed specifically for this purpose.A C++ implementation is available at http://www.rinst.org/ICS/ICS_Programs.tar.gz.",[],['Satwik Rajaram']
3,Endogenous central suppressive mechanisms regulating cough as potential targets for novel antitussive therapies.,"Cough and the accompanying sensation known as the urge-to-cough are complex neurobiological phenomena dependent on sensory and motor neural processing at many levels of the neuraxis. In addition to the excitatory neural circuits that provide the positive drive for inducing cough and the urge-to-cough, recent studies have highlighted the existence of likely inhibitory central neural processes that can be engaged to suppress cough sensorimotor processing. In many respects, the balance between excitatory and inhibitory central cough control may be a critical determinant of cough in health and disease which argues for the importance of understanding the biology of these putative central inhibitory processes. This brief review summarises the current knowledge of the central circuits that govern voluntary and involuntary cough suppression and posits the notion of targeting central suppressive mechanisms as a treatment for disordered cough in disease.

3,Young Genes out of the Male: An Insight from Evolutionary Age Analysis of the Pollen Transcriptome.,"The birth of new genes in genomes is an important evolutionary event. Several studies reveal that new genes in animals tend to be preferentially expressed in male reproductive tissues such as testis (Betr??n et al., 2002; Begun et al., 2007; Dubruille et al., 2012), and thus an ""out of testis"" hypothesis for the emergence of new genes has been proposed (Vinckenbosch et al., 2006; Kaessmann, 2010). However, such phenomena have not been examined in plant species. Here, by employing a phylostratigraphic method, we dated the origin of protein-coding genes in rice and Arabidopsis thaliana and observed a number of young genes in both species. These young genes tend to encode short extracellular proteins, which may be involved in rapid evolving processes, such as reproductive barriers, species specification, and anti-microbial processes. Further analysis of transcriptome age indexes across different tissues revealed that male reproductive cells express a phylogenetically younger transcriptome than other plant tissues. Compared with sporophytic tissues, the young transcriptomes of the male gametophyte displayed greater complexity and diversity, which included a higher ratio of anti-sense and inter-genic transcripts, reflecting a pervasive transcription state that facilitated the emergence of new genes. Here, we propose that pollen may act as an ""innovation incubator"" for the birth of de novo genes. With cases of male-biased expression of young genes reported in animals, the ""new genes out of the male"" model revealed a common evolutionary force that drives reproductive barriers, species specification, and the upgrading of defensive mechanisms against pathogens.","['evolution', 'pollen', 'transcriptome', 'young genes']","['Xiao Cui', 'Yang Lv', 'Miaolin Chen', 'Zoran Nikoloski', 'David Twell', 'Dabing Zhang']"
3,Nutritional impacts on gene expression in the surface mucosa of blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus).,"Short-term feed deprivation is a common occurrence in both wild and farmed fish species, due to reproductive processes, seasonal variations in temperature, or in response to a disease outbreak. Fasting can have dramatic physiological and biological consequences for fish, including impacts on mucosal immunity which can, in turn, change host susceptibility to pathogens. Culture and selection of blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) has gained importance as the production of a channel catfish??blue catfish (Ictalurus punctatus??I. furcatus) hybrid has increased in the Southeast US. Following a recent examination of fasting-induced impacts on mucosal immunity in channel catfish, here we utilized Illumina-based RNA-seq expression profiling to compare changes in blue catfish gill and skin after a brief (7 day) period of fasting. Transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly of over 194 million 100 base-pair transcript reads was followed by differential expression analysis. Fasting altered a total of 530 genes in the surface mucosa, including genes regulating the immune response, energy metabolism, mucus production, cellular cytoskeletal structure, cell proliferation, and antioxidant responses. In particular, fasting perturbed arginine synthesis and metabolism pathways in a manner likely altering macrophage activation states and immune readiness. Our findings highlight key mediators of the critical interaction between nutrition and immunity at points of pathogen adherence and entry.","['Feed deprivation', 'Fish', 'Flavobacterium columnare', 'Immune response', 'Mucosal', 'RNA-seq']","['Chao Li', 'Benjamin H Beck', 'Eric Peatman']"
3,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times: a psychophysiologist's view of cognitive aging.","This paper reviews research on age-related changes in working memory and attention control. This work is interpreted within a framework labeled ""GOLDEN aging"" (growing of lifelong differences explains normal aging), which is based on the idea that normal aging (as opposed to pathological aging) represents maturational processes causing progressive shifts in the distributions of mental abilities over the lifespan. As such, brain phenomena observed in normal aging are already apparent, under appropriate conditions, in younger adults. Among the phenomena that can be interpreted according to the GOLDEN aging framework are reductions in working memory capacity, impairments of inhibitory processes, increases in frontal lobe activation, and lack of suppression of responses as a function of repetition.",[],['Monica Fabiani']
3,From Cell to Tissue Properties-Modeling Skin Electroporation With Pore and Local Transport Region Formation.,"Current models of tissue electroporation either describe tissue with its bulk properties or include cell level properties, but model only a few cells of simple shapes in low-volume fractions or are in two dimensions. We constructed a three-dimensional model of realistically shaped cells in realistic volume fractions. By using a 'unit cell' model, the equivalent dielectric properties of whole tissue could be calculated. We calculated the dielectric properties of electroporated skin. We modeled electroporation of single cells by pore formation on keratinocytes and on the papillary dermis which gave dielectric properties of the electroporated epidermis and papillary dermis. During skin electroporation, local transport regions are formed in the stratum corneum. We modeled local transport regions and increase in their radii or density which affected the dielectric properties of the stratum corneum. The final model of skin electroporation accurately describes measured electric current and voltage drop on the skin during electroporation with long low-voltage pulses. The model also accurately describes voltage drop on the skin during electroporation with short high-voltage pulses. However, our results indicate that during application of short high-voltage pulses additional processes may occur which increase the electric current. Our model connects the processes occurring at the level of cell membranes (pore formation), at the level of a skin layer (formation of local transport region in the stratum corneum) with the tissue (skin layers) and even level of organs (skin). Using a similar approach, electroporation of any tissue can be modeled, if the morphology of the tissue is known.",[],"['Janja Dermol-Cerne', 'Damijan Miklavcic']"
3,Changes in motor performance and mental workload during??practice of reaching movements: a team dynamics perspective.,"Few investigations have examined mental workload during motor practice or learning in a context of team dynamics. This study examines the underlying cognitive-motor processes of motor practice by assessing the changes in motor performance and mental workload during practice of reaching movements. Individuals moved a robotic arm to reach targets as fast and as straight as possible while satisfying the task requirement of avoiding a collision between the end-effector and the workspace limits. Individuals practiced the task either alone (HA group) or with a synthetic teammate (HRT group), which regulated the effector velocity to help satisfy the task requirements. The findings revealed that the performance of both groups improved similarly throughout practice. However, when compared to the individuals of the HA group, those in the HRT group (1) had a lower risk of collisions, (2) exhibited higher performance consistency, and (3) revealed a higher level of mental workload while generally perceiving the robotic teammate as interfering with their performance. As the synthetic teammate changed the effector velocity in specific regions near the workspace boundaries, individuals may have been constrained to learn a piecewise visuomotor map. This piecewise map made the task more challenging, which increased mental workload and perception of the synthetic teammate as a burden. The examination of both motor performance and mental workload revealed a combination of both adaptive and maladaptive team dynamics. This work is a first step to examine the human cognitive-motor processes underlying motor practice in a context of team dynamics and contributes to inform human-robot applications.","['Assistive technologies', 'Human?€?robot interactions', 'Mental workload', 'Reaching movements', 'Team dynamics', 'Visuomotor practice']","['Isabelle M Shuggi', 'Patricia A Shewokis', 'Jeffrey W Herrmann', 'Rodolphe J Gentili']"
3,Role of cardiorespiratory synchronization and sleep physiology: effects on membrane potential in the restorative functions of sleep.,"Although sleep physiology has been extensively studied, many of the cellular processes that occur during sleep and the functional significance of sleep remain unclear. The degree of cardiorespiratory synchronization during sleep increases during the progression of slow-wave sleep (SWS). Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity also assumes a pattern that correlates with the progression of sleep. The ANS is an integral part of physiologic processes that occur during sleep with the respective contribution of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity varying between different sleep stages. In our paper, we attempt to unify the activities of various physiologic systems, namely the cardiac, respiratory, ANS and brain, during sleep into a consolidated picture with particular attention to the membrane potential of neurons. In our unified model, we explore the potential of sleep to promote restorative processes in the brain.

4,"Sorption kinetics, isotherms, and mechanism of aniline aerofloat to agricultural soils with various physicochemical properties.","Aniline aerofloat (AAF), a high-toxic organic flotation reagent, is widely used in mineral processing industry. However, little information on its environmental fate is available. AAF sorption to four types of agricultural soils at low concentrations (1-10?€?mg/L) was investigated using batch experiments. AAF sorption kinetics involved both boundary layer diffusion and intraparticle diffusion, following pseudo-second-order kinetics with equilibrium time within 120?€?min. Both Langmuir and Freundlich models fitted well the AAF sorption with the former better. Sorption of AAF to soils was a spontaneous and favorable physical sorption that was controlled by ion bridge effect and hydrophobic interaction that was related to van der Waals force and ?€-?€ coordination based on FTIR analyses. AAF sorption was remarkably affected by soil constituents, positively correlating with the contents of organic matter and clay. The relatively higher logK<sub>oc</sub> values (3.53-4.66) of AAF at environmental concentrations (1-5?€?mg/L) imply that soils are serving as a sink of AAF from beneficiation wastewater, posing great potential risks to environment and human health.","['Agricultural soils', 'Aniline aerofloat (AAF)', 'Mechanism', 'Organic flotation reagent', 'Sorption']","['Lei Xiang', 'Tao Xiao', 'Ce-Hui Mo', 'Hai-Ming Zhao', 'Yan-Wen Li', 'Hui Li', 'Quan-Ying Cai', 'Dong-Mei Zhou', 'Ming-Hung Wong']"
4,Water intensity assessment of shale gas resources in the Wattenberg field in northeastern Colorado.,"Efficient use of water, particularly in the western U.S., is an increasingly important aspect of many activities including agriculture, urban, and industry. As the population increases and agriculture and energy needs continue to rise, the pressure on water and other natural resources is expected to intensify. Recent advances in technology have stimulated growth in oil and gas development, as well as increasing the industry's need for water resources. This study provides an analysis of how efficiently water resources are used for unconventional shale development in Northeastern Colorado. The study is focused on the Wattenberg Field in the Denver-Julesberg Basin. The 2000 square mile field located in a semiarid climate with competing agriculture, municipal, and industrial water demands was one of the first fields where widespread use of hydraulic fracturing was implemented. The consumptive water intensity is measured using a ratio of the net water consumption and the net energy recovery and is used to measure how efficiently water is used for energy extraction. The water and energy use as well as energy recovery data were collected from 200 Noble Energy Inc. wells to estimate the consumptive water intensity. The consumptive water intensity of unconventional shale in the Wattenberg is compared with the consumptive water intensity for extraction of other fuels for other energy sources including coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, and renewables. 1.4 to 7.5 million gallons is required to drill and hydraulically fracture horizontal wells before energy is extracted in the Wattenberg Field. However, when the large short-term total freshwater-water use is normalized to the amount of energy produced over the lifespan of a well, the consumptive water intensity is estimated to be between 1.8 and 2.7 gal/MMBtu and is similar to surface coal mining.

4,Developing and validating a practical decision support tool (DST) for biomass selection on marginal land.,"Marginal, often contaminated, sites exist in large areas across the world as a result of historic activities such as industry, transportation and mineral extraction. Remediation, or other improvements, of these sites is typically only considered for sites with high exploitation pressure and those posing the highest risks to human health or the environment. At the same time there is increasing competition for land resources for different needs such as biofuel production. Potentially some of this land requirement could be met by production of biomass on brownfield or other marginal land, thereby improving the land while applying the crop cultivation as part of an integrated management strategy. The design and decision making for such a strategy will be site specific. A decision support framework, the Rejuvenate DST (decision support tool) has been developed with the aim of supporting such site specific decision making. This tool is presented here, and has been tested by applying it to a number of case study sites. The consequent SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities and threats) analysis is discussed and evaluated. The DST was found to be systematic, transparent, and applicable for diverse sites in France, Romania and Sweden, in addition to the sites to which it was applied through its development. The DST is regarded as especially useful if applied as a checklist in an iterative way throughout the decision process, from identifying potential crops to identifying knowledge gaps, working/non-working management strategies and potential risks. The DST also provides a structure promoting effective stakeholder engagement.

4,Tillage practices and straw-returning methods affect topsoil bacterial community and organic C under a rice-wheat cropping system in central China.,"The objective of this study was to investigate how the relationships between bacterial communities and organic C (SOC) in topsoil (0-5?€?cm) are affected by tillage practices [conventional intensive tillage (CT) or no-tillage (NT)] and straw-returning methods [crop straw returning (S) or removal (NS)] under a rice-wheat rotation in central China. Soil bacterial communities were determined by high-throughput sequencing technology. After two cycles of annual rice-wheat rotation, compared with CT treatments, NT treatments generally had significantly more bacterial genera and monounsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (MUFA/STFA), but a decreased gram-positive bacteria/gram-negative bacteria ratio (G(+)/G(-)). S treatments had significantly more bacterial genera and MUFA/STFA, but had decreased G(+)/G(-) compared with NS treatments. Multivariate analysis revealed that Gemmatimonas, Rudaea, Spingomonas, Pseudomonas, Dyella, Burkholderia, Clostridium, Pseudolabrys, Arcicella and Bacillus were correlated with SOC, and cellulolytic bacteria (Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Rudaea and Bacillus) and Gemmationas explained 55.3% and 12.4% of the variance in SOC, respectively.

4,"Potential risk of weed outbreak by increasing biochar's application rates in slow-growth legume, lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.).","Biochar amendment is a promising tool to improve the soil quality and, consequently, higher crop yield has received more attention during last decades. The positive effects of biochar have been attracting more attention especially in the areas with low precipitation rates, such as the Middle East, due to low soil organic carbon content, higher drought intensity, and increasing demands for food production. However, biochar can lead to lower herbicide efficacy, resulting in higher consumption of herbicides. In this study, the impact of two biochars on soil properties, plant growth, and fomesafen efficacy under rain-fed condition was investigated.Biochar amendment at the rate of 5 t ha<sup>-1</sup> improved soil quality and plant growth by 40-200% and 46-57%, respectively, compared to the control. The increase of biochar application rate from 5 t ha<sup>-1</sup> to 15 t ha<sup>-1</sup> showed small additional positive effects on soil and lentil as the tested crop plant, whereas the growth of weeds elevated by 200% in this case.Albeit biochar application could be an effective way to improve the soil fertility, the potential risk of weed outbreak in the long term should be evaluated carefully before the use of biochar amendment at field scale. ?? 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.","['biochar', 'fomesafen', 'lentil', 'plant biomass', 'soil nutrients', 'weed density']","['Mahdi Safaei Khorram', 'Akram Fatemi', 'Md Asaduzzaman Khan', 'Rudolf Kiefer', 'Sasan Jafarnia']"
4,Cultivation of Medicinal Mushroom Biomass by Solid-State Bioprocessing in Bioreactors.,"Basidiomycetes of various species and their wide range of pharmaceutically interesting products in the last decades represent one of the most attractive groups of natural products in Asia and North America. Production of fungal fruit bodies using farming technology is hardly covering the market. Comprehensive solid-state technologies and bioreactors are the most promising part for fast and large amount of cultivation of medicinal fungi biomass and its pharmaceutically active products. Wood, agriculture, and food industry wastes represent the main substrates that are in this process delignified and enriched in proteins and highly valuable pharmaceutically active compounds. Research in physiology, basic and applied studies in fungal metabolism, process engineering aspects, and clinical studies in the last two decades represent large contribution to the development of these potentials that initiate the development of new drugs and some of the most attractive over-the-counter human and veterinary remedies.

4,Resource or waste? A perspective of plastics degradation in soil with a focus on end-of-life options.,"'Capable-of-being-shaped' synthetic compounds are prevailing today over horn, bone, leather, wood, stone, metal, glass, or ceramic in products that were previously left to natural materials. Plastic is, in fact, economical, simple, adaptable, and waterproof. Also, it is durable and resilient to natural degradation (although microbial species capable of degrading plastics do exist). In becoming a waste, plastic accumulation adversely affects ecosystems. The majority of plastic debris pollutes waters, accumulating in oceans. And, the behaviour and the quantity of plastic, which has become waste, are rather well documented in the water, in fact. This review collects existing information on plastics in the soil, paying particular attention to both their degradation and possible re-uses. The use of plastics in agriculture is also considered. The discussion is organised according to their resin type and the identification codes used in recycling programs. In addition, options for post-consumer plastics are considered. Acknowledged indicators do not exist, and future study they will have to identify viable and shared methods to measure the presence and the degradation of individual polymers in soils.","['ABS, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene', 'BPA, bisphenol A', 'Biogeoscience', 'DOM, dissolved organic matter', 'EPR, Extended Producers Responsibility', 'EPS, expandable polystyrene', 'ETS, European Emissions Trading scheme', 'Environmental science', 'GPPS, Polystyrene (General Purpose)', 'HBCD, hexabromocyclododecane', 'HDPE, high-density polyethylene', 'HMC, heat melt compactor technology', 'Industry', 'LCP, liquid crystal polymers', 'LDPE, low-density polyethylene', 'Microbiology', 'NHV, net habitable volume', 'PA, polyamide', 'PAC, pro-oxidant additive containing', 'PBT, polybutylene terephthalate', 'PC, polycarbonate', 'PEEK, polyaryletheretherketone', 'PET, polyethylene terephthalate', 'PHA, polyhydroxyalkanoate', 'PLA, polylactic acid', 'PMMA, polymethyl methacrylate', 'POM, polyoxymethylene', 'PP, polypropylene', 'PPA, polyphthalamide', 'PPS, polyphenylene sulphide', 'PS, polystyrene', 'PSU, polyarylsulfone', 'PTFE, polytetrafluoroethylene', 'PU or PUR, polyurethane', 'PVC, polyvinyl chloride', 'PVDF, polydifluoroethylene', 'RIC, resin identification code', 'TPE, thermoplastic polyester elastomer']",['Riccardo Scalenghe']

4,"Environmental impacts of coal mine and thermal power plant to the surroundings of Barapukuria, Dinajpur, Bangladesh.","The study was carried out to analyse the environmental impacts of coal mine and coal-based thermal power plant to the surrounding environment of Barapukuria, Dinajpur. The analyses of coal, water, soil and fly ash were carried out using standard sample testing methods. This study found that coal mining industry and coal-based thermal power plant have brought some environmental and socio-economic challenges to the adjacent areas such as soil, water and air pollution, subsidence of agricultural land and livelihood insecurity of inhabitants. The pH values, heavy metal, organic carbon and exchangeable cations of coal water treated in the farmland soil suggest that coal mining deteriorated the surrounding water and soil quality. The SO4(2-) concentration in water samples was beyond the range of World Health Organisation standard. Some physico-chemical properties such as pH, conductivity, moisture content, bulk density, unburned carbon content, specific gravity, water holding capacity, liquid and plastic limit were investigated on coal fly ash of Barapukuria thermal power plant. Air quality data provided by the Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited were contradictory with the result of interview with the miners and local inhabitants. However, coal potentially contributes to the development of economy of Bangladesh but coal mining deteriorates the environment by polluting air, water and soil.

4,"Development of lightweight aggregates from stone cutting sludge, plastic wastes and sepiolite rejections for agricultural and environmental purposes.","Three different wastes have been assessed for lightweight aggregate (LWA) manufacturing: granite and marble sludge (COR), sepiolite rejections (SEP) and polyethylene-hexene thermoplastics (P). A preliminary study of the physical and chemical properties of the raw materials was carried out to design proper batches. It was mixed 10% SEP with 90% COR to confer plasticity, and in turn, 0, 2.5, 5 and 10% (w/w) of P was added to check its suitability as a bloating agent. The mixtures were milled, kneaded with water, extruded, shaped into pellets, oven-dried and finally fired at 1100, 1125 and 1150????C for 4, 8 and 16??min. The main technological properties of the aggregates related to bloating, density, porosity, loss on ignition, water absorption and compressive strength were measured. Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to study the microstructure of some LWAs. 23 out of 29 types of aggregate were lightweight, although neither bloating effect was observed, nor the typical cellular structure comprised of shell and core with relatively large pores was obtained, but a structure consisting of micropores and microchannels. The increase of temperature and time of firing involved a greater sintering, which in turn was translated into higher shrinkage, density and compressive strength values, but less porosity and water absorption. The addition of P did not involve any improvement, indeed it caused a significant decrease in compressive strength. The LWA sintered without P at the minimum time (4??min) and temperature of firing (1100????C) was selected to assess its water suction capability. The results pointed out that this LWA could be suitable in hydroponics and/or water filtration systems, even better than the commercial LWA Arlita G3. A new and most environment-friendly perspective in LWA industry arises from here, promoting LWA production at relative low temperatures (prior to significant sintering occurs) and using non-plastic silty wastes instead of clays as major components.","['Hydroponics', 'Lightweight aggregate', 'Ornamental rock', 'Sepiolite', 'Waste recycling', 'Water filtration']","['Jos??

4,A comprehensive estimation of the economic effects of meteorological services based on the input-output method.,"Concentrating on consuming coefficient, partition coefficient, and Leontief inverse matrix, relevant concepts and algorithms are developed for estimating the impact of meteorological services including the associated (indirect, complete) economic effect. Subsequently, quantitative estimations are particularly obtained for the meteorological services in Jiangxi province by utilizing the input-output method. It is found that the economic effects are noticeably rescued by the preventive strategies developed from both the meteorological information and internal relevance (interdependency) in the industrial economic system. Another finding is that the ratio range of input in the complete economic effect on meteorological services is about 1?€?:?€?108.27-1?€?:?€?183.06, remarkably different from a previous estimation based on the Delphi method (1?€?:?€?30-1?€?:?€?51).

4,Analysis of water and nitrogen use efficiency for maize (Zea mays L.) grown on soft rock and sand compound soil.,"Maize was grown on compound soils constituted from mixtures of soft rock and sand at different ratios, and water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency (FNUE) were quantified. The data were used to assist in designing strategies for optimizing water and nitrogen management practices for maize on the substrates used. Maize was sown in composite soil prepared at three ratios of soft rock and sand (1:1, 1:2 and 1:5?€?v/v) in Mu Us Sandy Land, Yuyang district, Yulin city, China. Yields, amount of drainage, nitrogen (N) leaching, WUE and NUE were calculated. Then a water and nitrogen management model (WNMM) was calibrated and validated.No significant difference in evapotranspiration of maize was found among compound soils with soft rock/sand ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:5, while water drainage increased significantly with increasing soft rock/sand ratio. WUE increased to 1.30?€?kg?€?m<sup>-3</sup> in compound soil with 1:2 soft rock/sand ratio. Nitrogen leaching and ammonia volatilization were the main reason for nitrogen loss, and N reduction mainly relied on crop uptake.

4,Utilization of Landsat-8 data for the estimation of carrot and maize crop water footprint under the arid climate of Saudi Arabia.,"The crop Water Footprint (WF) can provide a comprehensive knowledge of the use of water through the demarcation of the amount of the water consumed by different crops. The WF has three components: green (WFg), blue (WFb) and grey (WFgr) water footprints. The WFg refers to the rainwater stored in the root zone soil layer and is mainly utilized for agricultural, horticultural and forestry production. The WFb, however, is the consumptive use of water from surface or groundwater resources and mainly deals with irrigated agriculture, industry, domestic water use, etc. While the WFgr is the amount of fresh water required to assimilate pollutants resulting from the use of fertilizers/agrochemicals. This study was conducted on six agricultural fields in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia, during the period from December 2015 to December 2016, to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of the WF of silage maize and carrot crops. The WF of each crop was estimated in two ways, namely agro-meteorological (WFAgro) and remote sensing (WFRS) methods. The blue, green and grey components of WFAgro were computed with the use of weather station/Eddy covariance measurements and field recorded crop yield datasets. The WFRS estimated by applying surface energy balance principles on Landsat-8 imageries. However, due to non-availability of Landsat-8 data on the event of rainy days, this study was limited to blue component (WFRS-b). The WFAgro of silage maize was found to range from 3545 m3 t-1 to 4960 m3 t-1; on an average, the WFAgro-g, WFAgro-b, and WFAgro-gr are composed of < 1%, 77%, and 22%, respectively. In the case of carrot, the WFAgro ranged between 297 m3 t-1 and 502 m3 t-1. The WFAgro-g of carrot crop was estimated at <1%, while WFAgro-b and WFAgro-gr was 67% and 32%, respectively. The WFAgro-b is occupied as a major portion in WF of silage maize (77%) and carrot (68%) crops. This is due to the high crop water demand combined with a very erratic rainfall, the irrigation is totally provided using groundwater delivered by center pivot irrigation systems. On the other hand, the WFRS-b estimated using Landsat-8 data was varied from 276 (??73) m3 t-1 (carrot) and 2885 (??441) m3 t-1 (silage maize). The variation (RMSE) between WFRS-b and WFAgro-b was about 17% and 14% for silage maize and carrot crops, respectively.",[],"['Rangaswamy Madugundu', 'Khalid A Al-Gaadi', 'ElKamil Tola', 'Abdalhaleem A Hassaballa', 'Ahmed G Kayad']"
4,"Estimation of green house gas emissions from Koteshwar hydropower reservoir, India.","The emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) from soils are of significant importance for global warming. The biological and physico-chemical characteristics of soil affect the GHG emissions from soils of different land use types. Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) production rates from six forest and agricultural soil types in the Koteshwar hydropower reservoir catchments located in the Uttarakhand, India, were estimated and their relations with physico-chemical characteristics of soils were examined. The samples of different land use types were flooded and incubated under anaerobic condition at 30????C for 60??days. The cumulative GHG production rates in reservoir catchment are found as 1.52??????0.26, 0.13??????0.02, and 0.0004??????0.0001????g??g??soil<sup>-1</sup>??day<sup>-1</sup> for CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O, respectively, which is lower than global reservoirs located in the same eco-region. The significant positive correlation between CO<sub>2</sub> productions and labile organic carbon (LOC), CH<sub>4</sub> and C/N ratio, while N<sub>2</sub>O and N/P ratio, while pH of soils is negatively correlated, conforms their key role in GHG emissions. Carbon available as LOC in the reservoir catchment is found as 3-14% of the total ?€?C"" available in soils and 0-23% is retained in the soil after the completion of incubation. The key objective of this study to signify the C, N, and P ratios, LOC, and pH with GHG production rate by creating an incubation experiment (as in the case of benthic soil/sediment) in the lab for 60??days. In summary, the results suggest that carbon, as LOC were more sensitive indicators for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and significant C, N, and P ratios, affects the GHG emissions. This study is useful for the hydropower industry to know the GHG production rates after the construction of reservoir so that its effect could be minimized by taking care of catchment area treatment plan.","['Forest soils', 'Greenhouse gas', 'Incubation', 'Labile carbon', 'Production rate']","['Amit Kumar', 'M P Sharma']"
4,Food consumption trends and drivers.,"A picture of food consumption (availability) trends and projections to 2050, both globally and for different regions of the world, along with the drivers largely responsible for these observed consumption trends are the subject of this review. Throughout the world, major shifts in dietary patterns are occurring, even in the consumption of basic staples towards more diversified diets. Accompanying these changes in food consumption at a global and regional level have been considerable health consequences. Populations in those countries undergoing rapid transition are experiencing nutritional transition. The diverse nature of this transition may be the result of differences in socio-demographic factors and other consumer characteristics. Among other factors including urbanization and food industry marketing, the policies of trade liberalization over the past two decades have implications for health by virtue of being a factor in facilitating the 'nutrition transition' that is associated with rising rates of obesity and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Future food policies must consider both agricultural and health sectors, thereby enabling the development of coherent and sustainable policies that will ultimately benefit agriculture, human health and the environment.",[],['John Kearney']
4,Direct contact membrane distillation applied to saline wastewater: parameter optimization.,"Freshwater availability is increasingly under pressure from growing demand, resource depletion and environmental pollution. Desalination of saline wastewater is an option for supplying households, industry and agriculture with water, but technologies such as reverse osmosis, evaporation or electrodialysis are energy intensive. By contrast, membrane distillation (MD) is a competitive technology for water desalination. In our study, response surface methodology was applied to optimize the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) treatment of synthetic saline wastewater. The aim was to enhance the process performance and the permeate flux Jp (L/m<sup>2</sup>??h) by optimizing the operating parameters: temperature difference ??T, feed velocity Vf, salt concentration [NaCl], and glucose concentration [Gluc]. The results are a high permeate quality, with 99.9% electrical conductivity reduction and more than 99.9% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate. The predicted optimum permeate flux Jp was 34.1 L/m<sup>2</sup>??h at ??T = 55.2 ??C and Vf = 0.086 m/s, the two most significant parameters.

4,Human health problems associated with current agricultural food production.,"Scientific and technological developments in the agricultural sectors in the recent past has resulted in increased food production and at the same time led to certain public health concerns. Unseasonal rains at the time of harvest and improper post harvest technology often results in agricultural commodities being contaminated with certain fungi and results in the production of mycotoxins. Consumption of such commodities has resulted in human disease outbreaks. Naturally occurring toxins, inherently present in foods and either consumed as such or mixed up with grains, had been responsible for disease outbreaks. Other possible causes of health concern include the application of various agrochemicals such as pesticides and the use of antibiotics in aquaculture and veterinary practices. Foodborne pathogens entering the food chain during both traditional and organic agriculture pose a challenge to public health. Modern biotechnology, producing genetically modified foods, if not regulated appropriately could pose dangers to human health. Use of various integrated food management systems like the Hazard Analysis and critical control system approach for risk prevention, monitoring and control of food hazards are being emphasized with globalization to minimise the danger posed to human health from improper agricultural practices.",[],['Ramesh V Bhat']

4,Microplastics in Sewage Sludge: Effects of Treatment.,"Waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) are receptors for the cumulative loading of microplastics (MPs) derived from industry, landfill, domestic wastewater and stormwater. The partitioning of MPs through the settlement processes of wastewater treatment results in the majority becoming entrained in the sewage sludge. This study characterized MPs in sludge samples from seven WWTPs in Ireland which use anaerobic digestion (AD), thermal drying (TD), or lime stabilization (LS) treatment processes. Abundances ranged from 4196 to 15?€?385 particles kg<sup>-1</sup> (dry weight). Results of a general linear mixed model (GLMM) showed significantly higher abundances of MPs in smaller size classes in the LS samples, suggesting that the treatment process of LS shears MP particles. In contrast, lower abundances of MPs found in the AD samples suggests that this process may reduce MP abundances. Surface morphologies examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed characteristics of melting and blistering of TD MPs and shredding and flaking of LS MPs. This study highlights the potential for sewage sludge treatment processes to affect the risk of MP pollution prior to land spreading and may have implications for legislation governing the application of biosolids to agricultural land.",[],"['A M Mahon', ""B O'Connell"", 'M G Healy', ""I O'Connor"", 'R Officer', 'R Nash', 'L Morrison']"

The degradation product (compound 1) of OTA was treated with crude enzyme. The product has been isolated and identified as C<sub>11</sub> H<sub>9</sub> O<sub>5</sub> Cl (ochratoxin ??), which is a weak lipophilic molecule, in contrast to fat-soluble OTA. The cytotoxic response of compound 1 was revealed to be different to that of OTA. Compound 1 does not induce cellular oxidative damage in comparison with OTA, which may cause lipid peroxidation (MDA), reduce SOD activity and induce DNA damage.This study indicates that A. niger has the ability to detoxify OTA. The OTA degradation product, ochratoxin ??, does not exert cytotoxic effects on cell metabolism. A. niger has prospective uses for the OTA decontamination of food and agricultural fields. ?? 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.","['Aspergillus strain', 'cytotoxic responses', 'degradation product', 'ochratoxin A', 'ochratoxin ??']","['Ke Xiong', 'Xiao-Ling Wang', 'Hui-Wei Zhi', 'Bao-Guo Sun', 'Xiu-Ting Li']"
4,Valorisation of untreated cane molasses for enhanced phytase production by Bacillus subtilis K46b and its potential role in dephytinisation.,"The high cost of phytase production is the most limiting factor in its application in animal feeds. The present study aimed to develop a low-cost medium for production of a novel phytase in submerged fermentation using inexpensive agro-industrial by-products. The applicability of phytase in dephytinisation of commonly used food/feed ingredients, i.e. soybean meal and wheat bran, was also investigated.Using a one-factor-at-a-time approach, soybean meal and cane molasses were identified as significant agro-industrial by-products and these factors were subsequently optimised using response surface methodology (RSM). A central composite design was employed to further enhance phytase yield. Under optimum conditions of soybean meal 22.3?€?g?€?L<sup>-1</sup> , cane molasses 100?€?g?€?L<sup>-1</sup> and 39?€?h fermentation, phytase production increased to 56.562 U mL<sup>-1</sup> , indicating more than 28-fold enhancement. The enzyme efficiently dephytinised wheat bran and soybean meal after 24?€?h incubation at 56.5?€???C and increased inorganic phosphate content by 240% and 155%, respectively.Soybean meal and cane molasses were successfully used for enhancement of phytase production as economical carbon, nitrogen and phytic acid sources using RSM. The phytase showed a good capability to dephytinise wheat bran and soybean meal, demonstrating that the enzyme can be considered as a potential candidate for industrial food and feed applications. ?? 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.","['cane molasses', 'dephytinisation', 'phytase', 'response surface methodology', 'soybean meal', 'wheat bran']","['Karim Rocky-Salimi', 'Maryam Hashemi', 'Mohammad Safari', 'Maryam Mousivand']"
4,Effects of silver nanoparticles on stress biomarkers of Channa striatus: immuno-protective or toxic?,"Nanotechnology is a novel arena with promising applications in the field of medicine, industry, and agriculture including fisheries. Cross-disciplinary interactions and the application of this technology in biological systems have led to the innovation of novel nanoparticle antioxidants, which are the subject of our study. In context with above background, we designed an experiment on nano-silver to elucidate its role for mitigation of abiotic and biotic stress. Three diets were formulated viz. silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) incorporated at 0.5 and 1??mg/kg diet and control diet (Ag-NPs at 0??mg/kg). Fish were exposed to sublethal level of 1/25th of LC<sub>50</sub> (4??ppm) of lead (Pb) and temperature at 34????C. The effect of Ag-NPs on productive performance (weight gain %, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, and specific growth rate), stress biomarkers (catalase, super oxide dismutase, glutathione-s-transferase, acetylcholine esterase, cortisol, heat shock protein), biochemical and immunological response (protein and carbohydrate metabolic enzymes, phagocytic activity, serum total protein and albumin: globulin ratio), histopathology alterations in the liver and gill as well as survival of Channa striatus, following challenge with pathogenic bacteria were evaluated. Dietary Ag-NPs at 0.5-mg supplementation improved growth performance, immunity, survival, and reduced stress biomarker such as HSP 70, cortisol, and blood glucose in various fish tissues. Exposure to Pb and high temperature and group fed with Ag-NPs (1??mg/kg diet) demonstrated remarkable changes in the histo-architect of liver such as pyknotic nuclei, pyknosis, leucocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and karyokinesis, blood vessels with nucleated, lipid vacuoles in the liver tissue. Histology of gill displayed hyperplasia, aneurism, blood congestion, severe telengiectiasis, epithelial lifting, curling of secondary lamella, hyperplasia of epithelial cell of secondary lamella in the group exposed to lead and high temperature and supplemented with Ag-NPs at 1??mg/kg diet. In addition to histopathology, feeding with Ag-NPs at 1??mg/kg diet deteriorated and altered all studied parameters including reduced growth performance. Results obtained in the present study suggest that supplementation of Ag-NPs at 0.5??mg/kg diet has a definitive role to play in the mitigation of abiotic and biotic stress in C. striatus.","['Fish', 'Immunity', 'Oxidative stress', 'Silver nanoparticles', 'Stress biomarker']","['Neeraj Kumar', 'Kishore Kumar Krishnani', 'Sanjay Kumar Gupta', 'Narendra Pratap Singh']"
4,Peroxidase-Like Activity of Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid and Its Application for Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Biomarkers and Circular Tumor Cells.,"Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is such a powerful chelating agent that it may form stable complexes with most metal ions, which has wide applications in industry, agriculture, environment, and pharmaceutical technology. Recently, EDTA was found to enhance the photocatalytic property of some materials. Inspired by this fact of EDTA in the photocatalytic role, we further investigated the photocatalytic property of EDTA and found much the same as that of natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP). This significant discovery of peroxidase-like property may extend the applications of conventional EDTA in life science. A novel and colorimetric sensor based on the peroxidase-like EDTA and unique gold nanorods (GNRs) was designed. Under light irradiation, EDTA may catalyze decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and in situ regulate the longitudinal plasmon wavelength (LPW) of GNRs, displaying various color solution as a read-out means. This colorimetric nanosensor has a great potential to develop into a platform to quantitatively determine analytes as long as the specific antibodies against them were available. Biomarkers of different diseases, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, were detected with high accuracy. Moreover, combined with immunomagnetic separation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood, a visual read-out for detection of CTCs was established, which has promising applications in clinical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, and food quality control only using naked eyes.",[],"['Haowen Huang', 'Lanfang Liu', 'Lingyang Zhang', 'Qian Zhao', 'Yuan Zhou', 'Shishan Yuan', 'Zilong Tang', 'Xuanyong Liu']"
4,"Malthus is still wrong: we can feed a world of 9-10 billion, but only by reducing food demand.","In 1798, Thomas Robert Malthus published 'An essay on the principle of population' in which he concluded that: 'The power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race.' Over the following century he was criticised for underestimating the potential for scientific and technological innovation to provide positive change. Since then, he has been proved wrong, with a number of papers published during the past few decades pointing out why he has been proved wrong so many times. In the present paper, I briefly review the main changes in food production in the past that have allowed us to continue to meet ever growing demand for food, and I examine the possibility of these same innovations delivering food security in the future. On the basis of recent studies, I conclude that technological innovation can no longer be relied upon to prove Malthus wrong as we strive to feed 9-10 billion people by 2050. Unless we are prepared to accept a wide range of significant, undesirable environmental consequences, technology alone cannot provide food security in 2050. Food demand, particularly the demand for livestock products, will need to be managed if we are to continue to prove Malthus wrong into the future.

4,Dicotyledon Weed Quantification Algorithm for Selective Herbicide Application in Maize Crops.,"The stricter legislation within the European Union for the regulation of herbicides that are prone to leaching causes a greater economic burden on the agricultural industry through taxation. Owing to the increased economic burden, research in reducing herbicide usage has been prompted. High-resolution images from digital cameras support the studying of plant characteristics. These images can also be utilized to analyze shape and texture characteristics for weed identification. Instead of detecting weed patches, weed density can be estimated at a sub-patch level, through which even the identification of a single plant is possible. The aim of this study is to adapt the monocot and dicot coverage ratio vision (MoDiCoVi) algorithm to estimate dicotyledon leaf cover, perform grid spraying in real time, and present initial results in terms of potential herbicide savings in maize. The authors designed and executed an automated, large-scale field trial supported by the Armadillo autonomous tool carrier robot. The field trial consisted of 299 maize plots. Half of the plots (parcels) were planned with additional seeded weeds; the other half were planned with naturally occurring weeds. The in-situ evaluation showed that, compared to conventional broadcast spraying, the proposed method can reduce herbicide usage by 65% without measurable loss in biological effect.","['grid sprayer', 'herbicide reduction', 'monocot and dicot coverage ratio vision (MoDiCoVi)', 'site specific', 'sprayer boom', 'weed crop discrimination']","['Morten Stigaard Laursen', 'Rasmus Nyholm J??rgensen', 'Henrik Skov Midtiby', 'Kjeld Jensen', 'Martin Peter Christiansen', 'Thomas Mosgaard Giselsson', 'Anders Krogh Mortensen', 'Peter Kryger Jensen']"
4,Challenges of climate change: omics-based biology of saffron plants and organic agricultural biotechnology for sustainable saffron production.,"Kashmir Valley is a major saffron (Crocus sativus Kashmirianus) growing area of the world, second only to Iran in terms of production. In Kashmir, saffron is grown on uplands (termed in the local language as ""Karewas""), which are lacustrine deposits located at an altitude of 1585 to 1677 m above mean sea level (amsl), under temperate climatic conditions. Kashmir, despite being one of the oldest historical saffron-producing areas, faces a rapid decline of saffron industry. Among many other factors responsible for decline of saffron industry the preponderance of erratic rainfalls and drought-like situation have become major challenges imposed by climate change. Saffron has a limited coverage area as it is grown as a 'niche crop' and is a recognized ""geographical indication,"" growing under a narrow microclimatic condition. As such it has become a victim of climate change effects, which has the potential of jeopardizing the livelihood of thousands of farmers and traders associated with it. The paper discusses the potential and actual impact of climate change process on saffron cultivation in Kashmir; and the biotechnological measures to address these issues.","['Crocus sativus', 'Kashmir', 'Saffron', 'climate change', 'stress']",['Amjad M Husaini']
4,Genetic engineering modification and fermentation optimization for extracellular production of recombinant proteins using Escherichia coli.,"As a common expression host, Escherichia coli has received more and more attention due to the recently developed secretory expression system, which offers advantages like reduced downstream bioprocesses and improved product quality. These advantages, coupled with high-density fermentation technology, make it a preferred system for large-scale production of many proteins utilized in industry and agriculture at a reduced process cost. To improve the secretion efficiency of target proteins, various strategies, including signal peptide optimization, periplasmic leakage, and chaperones co-expression have been developed. In addition, the optimization of the fermentation conditions such as temperature, inducer, and medium were also taken into account for the extracellular production in the high-density fermentation to reduce the cost of production. Here, these strategies ranging from genetic engineering to fermentation optimization were summarized for the future guidance of extracellular production of recombinant proteins using E. coli.","['Escherichia coli', 'Genetic engineering strategy', 'High-density fermentation', 'Secretory expression system']","['Yuling Zhou', 'Zhenghui Lu', 'Xiang Wang', 'Jonathan Nimal Selvaraj', 'Guimin Zhang']"

4,Physico-chemical and physiological changes during fruit development and on-tree ripening of two Spanish jujube cultivars (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.).,"Few studies have been performed on changes in organoleptic, nutritive, functional, and physiological properties during jujube fruit development and on-tree ripening. In this work, a comparative study on the evolution of physical, chemical, nutritive, and physiological parameters and bioactive compounds of two Spanish jujube cultivars was performed.Both cultivars showed a non-climacteric ripening pattern, although the JM cultivar was smaller, sweeter, softer, and more highly coloured than the JG, which was characterised by having larger and firmer fruits, although less sweet and coloured. Both cultivars showed high TAA, which was highly correlated with the concentration of total phenols, giving them great functional properties.This fruit has little economic importance in Spain and it is just marginally grown for self-consumption or for ornamental purposes. Given the excellent properties of these fruits, it could be considered a fruit species of great interest, and commercial growth of these cultivars with high yields and fruits with high functional properties should be promoted. ?? 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.","['antioxidants', 'functional properties', 'non-climacteric fruit', 'organic acids', 'phenols', 'sugars']","['Soledad Almansa', 'Francisca Hern??ndez', 'Pilar Legua', 'Mar??a Nicol??s-Almansa', 'Asunci??n Amor??s']"
4,The agricultural-industrial partnership for eliminating micronutrient malnutrition: the investment bargain of the decade.,"The limitations of conventional approaches to eliminating micronutrient deficiencies drives the search for a sustainable paradigm.

4,Investigation of a Worker Death While Agitating Manure in a Non-enclosed Storage.,"An in-depth investigation of an unusual, non-enclosed manure storage hydrogen sulfide-induced fatality on a Holstein beef production operation is presented. The case involved several factors that likely played a role in the young farmer's death. These included zero wind movement, a reported temperature inversion in the area, relatively cool late summer outdoor temperatures on the morning of the incident, higher outdoor temperatures the week prior, and a high by-product steer ration containing ingredients that contributed significant sulfur content to the stored manure. Recommendations are offered for future research to determine the combinations of conditions and inputs that have potential to increase human and animal risk around manure storage structures. Based on this case and others recently documented showing unsafe levels of hydrogen sulfide being released from similar outdoor storages, it is critical that agricultural industry experts and input suppliers continue to analyze risk and consequences associated with new management practices, processes, inputs (including feed ingredients and animal bedding), machines, and other technology developed to support animal agriculture. Production practice and educational guidance are also offered based on this case and published literature.","['Death/fatality', 'hydrogen sulfide', 'manure storage', 'occupational hazard']","['John M Shutske', 'Daniel Schaefer', 'Rebecca Larson', 'Kevin Erb', 'Cheryl Skjolaas', 'Stephanie Leonard', 'Jeff Nelson', 'Elizabeth Binversie', 'Scott Rifleman']"
4,Optical and physical mapping with local finishing enables megabase-scale resolution of agronomically important regions in the wheat genome.,"Numerous scaffold-level sequences for wheat are now being released and, in this context, we report on a strategy for improving the overall assembly to a level comparable to that of the human genome.Using chromosome 7A of wheat as a model, sequence-finished megabase-scale sections of this chromosome were established by combining a new independent assembly using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical map, BAC pool paired-end sequencing, chromosome-arm-specific mate-pair sequencing and Bionano optical mapping with the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium RefSeq v1.0 sequence and its underlying raw data. The combined assembly results in 18 super-scaffolds across the chromosome. The value of finished genome regions is demonstrated for two approximately 2.5 Mb regions associated with yield and the grain quality phenotype of fructan carbohydrate grain levels. In addition, the 50 Mb centromere region analysis incorporates cytological data highlighting the importance of non-sequence data in the assembly of this complex genome region.Sufficient genome sequence information is shown to now be available for the wheat community to produce sequence-finished releases of each chromosome of the reference genome. The high-level completion identified that an array of seven fructosyl transferase genes underpins grain quality and that yield attributes are affected by five F-box-only-protein-ubiquitin ligase domain and four root-specific lipid transfer domain genes.

4,Antibodies from plants for bionanomaterials.,"Antibodies are produced as part of the vertebrate adaptive immune response and are not naturally made by plants. However, antibody DNA sequences can be introduced into plants, and together with laboratory technologies that allow the design of antibodies recognizing any conceivable molecular structure, plants can be used as 'green factories' to produce any antibody at all. The advent of plant-based transient expression systems in particular allows the rapid, convenient, and safe production of antibodies, ranging from laboratory-scale expression to industrial-scale manufacturing. The key features of plant-based production include safety, speed, low cost, and convenience, allowing newcomers to rapidly master the technology and use it to its full advantage. Manufacturing in plants has recently achieved significant milestones and offers more than just an alternative to established microbial and mammalian cell platforms. The use of plants for product development in particular offers the power and flexibility to easily coexpress many different genes, allowing the plug-and-play construction of novel bionanomaterials, perfectly complementing existing approaches based on plant virus-like particles. As well as producing single antibodies for applications in medicine, agriculture, and industry, plants can be used to produce antibody-based supramolecular structures and scaffolds as a new generation of green bionanomaterials that promise a bright future based on clean and renewable nanotechnology applications.

This challenge can be met by applying fish frozen at sea. When using frozen fish, the methods employed for thawing may influence the safety and quality of the final product. This study aimed to investigate the applicability of novel thawing strategies in order to provide an all-year supply of high-quality and safe cod products.Comparative investigations of quality and safety factors after thawing in water, with and without air circulation, and contact thawing were performed. The parameters included water-holding capacity, thawing loss, drip loss, cooking yield, sensory evaluation and microbiological analyses (including total volatile bases nitrogen). Water thawing with air circulation provided faster thawing than water thawing without air circulation and contact thawing. For all three methods, the quality of the thawed fish was acceptable and the shelf life of the fillets during chilled storage was between 10 and 14 days post-filleting.The results show that controlled freezing of cod, followed by appropriate thawing, may provide the processing industry with an all-year delivery of raw materials, without compromising quality and safety of the final product. ?? 2017 The Authors.

4,Application of a Dielectric Barrier Discharge Atmospheric Cold Plasma (Dbd-Acp) for Eshcerichia Coli Inactivation in Apple Juice.,"Atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) is a promising non-thermal technology in food industry. In this study, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD)-ACP exhibited strong bactericidal effect on Escherichia coli in apple juice. Under a 30 to 50 W input power, less than 40 s treatment time was required for DBD-ACP to result in 3.98 to 4.34 log CFU/mL reduction of E. coli in apple juice. The inactivation behavior of ACP on E. coli was well described by the Weibull model. During the treatment, the cell membrane of E. coli was damaged severely by active species produced by plasma, such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone and nitrate. In addition, the ACP exposure had slight effect on the ??Brix, pH, titratable acidity (TA), color values, total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacity of apple juice. However, higher level of DBD-ACP treatment, 50 W for more than 10 s in this case, resulted in significant change of the pH, TA, color and total phenolic content of apple juice. The results in this study have provided insight in potential use of DBD-ACP as an alternative to thermal processing for fruit juices in food industry.Escherichia coli O157:H7 in apple juice is a potential risk for public health. This study demonstrated that 30 s cold plasma treatment resulted in more than 4 log CFU/mL reduction under 50 W, while the quality attributes of apple juice were not significantly affected. Therefore, cold plasma technology is a promising alternative substitute of traditional thermal processing for juice pasteurization.","['apple juice, cold plasma, Escherichia coli', 'inactivation mechanism, quality']","['Xinyu Liao', 'Jiao Li', 'Aliyu Idris Muhammad', 'Yuanjie Suo', 'Shiguo Chen', 'Xingqian Ye', 'Donghong Liu', 'Tian Ding']"
4,[Reactivity-based Anthropogenic VOCs Emission Inventory in China].,"A reactivity-based anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emission inventory in China in 2010 was developed on the basis of ozone formation potential (OFP), using the latest VOCs emission inventory, source profiles and maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) values. The results showed that the total anthropogenic OFP was 84187.61 kt in China in 2010, of which 6882.53 kt was from alkanes, 41496.92 kt from alkenes/alkynes, 32945.32 kt from aromatic hydrocarbons, 161.45 kt from halocarbons, and 2701.40 kt from oxygenated organics.

Industrial sources accounted for the largest (49.29%) of the total OFP, followed by transportation sources (28.31%) and agricultural sources (22.40%). The key industrial sources with high reactivity were architectural decoration industry, oil refinery industry, storage and transport, machinery equipment industry, transport equipment industry and printing. Passenger cars, motorcycles and heavy duty vehicles were the major OFP sources of transportation. The two biomass burning sources were both the key OFP sources of agriculture. Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Henan were the top five provinces with contributions of 39.65% of the total OFP in China.

4,Influence of green waste compost on azimsulfuron dissipation and soil functions under oxic and anoxic conditions.,"Concerns have been raised over the sustainability of intensive rice cultivation, where the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has been associated with numerous environmental problems. The objective of this study was to test the effect of the herbicide azimsulfuron on important soil functions as affected by amendment with a byproduct of the olive oil industry. Soil was collected from a Mediterranean rice field. Part of it was amended with alperujo compost (AC). Amended and unamended soils were incubated for 43days in presence or not of azimsulfuron, under anoxic-flooded (AF) and oxic-unflooded (OU) conditions. We monitored the dissipation of the herbicide azimsulfuron, C mineralization, soil microbial biomass (SMB) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and its nature. Under AF conditions, the application of compost produced an increase in the dissipation of the herbicide (up to 12.4%). It was related with the higher DOC content, 4 times higher than under OU conditions. Though increases in carbon turnover (under AF and OU conditions) and reduction of SMBC after herbicide application (only under AF conditions) were observed, the differences were not statistically significant. The application of this organic amendment is presented as an efficient management strategy to increase C turnover in agricultural soils and reduce some of the negative effects derived from the application of azimsulfuron under flooded conditions.

In this context, the application of anaerobic digestion (AD) as a core treatment technology in industrial plants should be highlighted, since this process combines the pollution control of wastewaters and the generation of bioenergy, based on the conversion of the organic fraction to biogas, a methane-rich gaseous mixture that may supply the energetic demands in industrial plants. In this context, this work aimed at assessing the energetic potential of AD applied to the treatment of stillage, the main wastewater from ethanol production, in an attempt to highlight the improvements in the energy balance ratio of ethanol by inserting the heating value of methane as a bioenergy source. At least 5-15% of the global energy consumption in the ethanol industry could be supplied by the energetic potential of stillage, regardless the feedstock (i.e. sugarcane, corn or cassava). The association between bagasse combustion and stillage anaerobic digestion in sugarcane-based distilleries could provide a bioenergy surplus of at least 130% of the total fossil fuel input into the ethanol plant, considering only the energy from methane. In terms of financial aspects, the economic gains could reach US$ 0.1901 and US$ 0.0512 per liter of produced ethanol, respectively for molasses- (Brazil) and corn-based (EUA) production chains. For large-scale (???1000 m(3)EtOH per day) Brazilian molasses-based plants, an annual economic gain of up to US$ 70 million could be observed. Considering the association between anaerobic and aerobic digestion, for the scenarios analyzed, at least 25% of the energetic potential of stillage would be required to supply the energy consumption with aeration, however, more suitable effluents for agricultural application could be produced. The main conclusion from this work indicates that anaerobic processes should be considered the core technology to treat stillage, based mainly on the attractive relation energy generation-financial return and on the possibility to keep the advantages inherent to the common fertigation when using the treated effluent in agriculture.
