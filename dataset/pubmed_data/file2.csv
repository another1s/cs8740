"SURVEILLANCE FOR HEMORRHAGIC SEPTICEMIA IN BUFFALO ( BUBALUS BUBALIS) AS AN AID TO RANGE EXPANSION OF THE JAVAN RHINOCEROS ( RHINOCEROS SONDAICUS) IN UJUNG KULON NATIONAL PARK, INDONESIA.","The Javan rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros sondaicus) of Ujung Kulon National Park (UKNP) is the crown jewel of Indonesia's rich natural history. The park lies on a peninsula surrounded by coastline and agriculture-dominated landscapes. The invasion of water buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis) into the park carries a substantial health risk to the Javan rhinoceros and threatens plans to establish a new population outside of its only current range in UKNP. Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS), known locally as septicemia epizootica and caused by Pasteurella multocida B:2, could thwart Indonesia's efforts to expand the range of the Javan rhinoceros. Because HS was considered eradicated from Banten Province, few preventative programs have been available to farmers. During June 2012-July 2013, biologic samples were collected from 770 water buffalo in 19 villages. Deep nasal swabs ( n=85) were taken for bacterial culture and blood samples ( n=770) were collected for serologic testing. No animals were positive on culture. The prevalence of antibody to P. multocida in this population was 1.8% (14 of 770 animals). A structured questionnaire was used to gather information about possible risk factors. Husbandry practices associated with presence of antibody in water buffalo included lack of a permanent area to house buffalo at night, low body condition score (=2), high body temperature (≥40 C), a history of clinical signs or sudden death in the previous year, and a grazing system that utilized significant forage inside the park. Antibody was not associated with sex, age, vaccination status, or season. Understanding HS disease dynamics in the buffalo adjacent to UKNP may improve the livelihoods of people and health of endangered rhinoceroses in this ecosystem.","['Bubalus bubalis', 'Javan rhinoceros', 'Rhinoceros sondaicus', 'Ujung Kulon National Park, Indonesia', 'hemorrhagic septicemia', 'septicemia epizootica', 'water buffalo']","['Kurnia Oktavia Khairani', 'Daryl Nydam', 'M Julia Felippe', 'Pat McDonough', 'Jason Barry', 'Rois Mahmud', 'M Haryono', 'Robin W Radcliffe']"
Host responses and bacterial colonization following inoculation of Pasteurella multocida P<sub>52</sub> strain into unvaccinated and aluminum hydroxide gel hemorrhagic septicemia vaccinated mice.,"Hemorrhagic septicemia is a highly infectious and contagious disease caused by Pasteurella multocida serogroup B:2 in tropical Asian and African countries. The acute inflammatory responses induced by Pasteurella multocida are the main cause of death in hemorrhagic septicemia. Therefore, present study was undertaken to examine the blood cytokine expression profiles (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), bacterial colonization and histopathological changes of intraperitoneally and subcutaneously challenged vaccinated and unvaccinated mice with 10<sup>2</sup> CFU of P. multocida P<sub>52</sub>. The observations were made at 6, 12, 18, 24 h and 48 h intervals. Real-time PCR based blood cytokine profiles (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) measurement revealed a significantly higher amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in the unvaccinated challenged group of mice than the vaccinated challenged group. There was heavy bacterial load in all organs of mice viz. trachea, lung, spleen, within 6 h of challenge in both vaccinated and unvaccinated group of mice, but bacterial load increased in the unvaccinated challenged group of mice with respect to time whereas the load were constant in the vaccinated challenged group. Histopathological changes were mild in the vaccinated challenged group of mice in comparison to the unvaccinated challenged group. There was no significant difference in the bacterial load, histopathological changes and cytokines expression when challenged through different routes.","['Bacterial count', 'Cytokine profile', 'Host pathogen response', 'Pasteurella multocida']","['Mamta Singh', 'Rishendra Verma', 'Ramane Sangram Pandit', 'Najeeb Ul Tarfain']"
Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection-mediated sequential changes in microRNAs profile of Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells.,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs and are involved in the regulation of wide biological processes. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is the causative agent of viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) disease causing a heavy loss in aquaculture farms. In this study, we tried to explore the effect of VHSV infection on microRNAs profile of Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells at different points of time (0, 3, 12, 24, and 48 h post infection). A total of 355 conserved microRNAs and 3 novel microRNAs were identified, and among them, 103 microRNAs were differentially expressed. The number of differentially expressed microRNAs was highly increased at 24 h.p.i compared to 3 h.p.i and 12 h.p.i., suggesting that EPC cells might not actively respond to VHSV infection at an early infection period, which can allow viruses to transcript and translate their genes enough to produce viral particles that can infect to another cells. Among the differentially expressed microRNAs, 2 miRNAs (miR-735 and miR-738) that were reported only in fish species were highly upregulated, and based on the target prediction, they could regulate several immune pathways. Furthermore, the present results showed the upregulation of representative immune regulating microRNAs such as miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-99. The target prediction of differentially expressed miRNAs, GO, and KEGG pathways analysis revealed that several biological processes and different pathways were affected by the viral infection. The present dynamical changing patterns of differentially expressed microRNAs in response to the progression of VHSV infection suggest that microRNA profile that was analyzed at one time point cannot provide enough information for the interpretation of the disease mechanism. Considering the wide and complex interactions between microRNAs and genes expression, the present results provide the basis for the understanding of VHSV infection-mediated cellular responses and for future investigations on the development of possible control measures.","['Epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells', 'MicroRNAs', 'Next-generation sequencing', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Abdellaoui Najib', 'Min Sun Kim', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
"Montanide IMS 1312 VG adjuvant enhances the efficacy of immersion vaccine of inactivated viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus.","Vaccination by immersion is suitable for mass vaccination of small size fish. However, no viral vaccine has been developed for immersion applications, because of low efficacy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of immersion vaccine against viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) containing Montanide IMS 1312 VG adjuvant in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Healthy fish were vaccinated by an immersion method with a heat-inactivated FP-VHS2010-1 strain of VHS virus (VHSV) in combination with Montanide IMS 1312 VG for 5 min at 20 ± 2 °C. The control group was vaccinated with sterile PBS. No toxicity of immersion vaccine with Montanide IMS 1312 VG adjuvant was observed by hematological and histopathological analysis. Immersion vaccine with adjuvant enhanced gene expression of immune-associated genes, i.e., genes encoding interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3. Relative percent survival (RPS) of fish was measured on weeks 4 and 8 post vaccination. In fish vaccinated with adjuvant, RPS was significantly higher than that of fish vaccinated without adjuvant. The results of the present study provide evidence that the VHSV immersion vaccine with Montanide IMS 1312 VG induces protective immunity in olive flounder against VHS.","['Adjuvant', 'Immersion vaccine', 'Olive flounder', 'Paralichthys olivaceus', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Jee Youn Hwang', 'Mun-Gyeong Kwon', 'Yu Jin Kim', 'Sung-Hee Jung', 'Myoung-Ae Park', 'Maeng-Hyun Son']"
"A DNA vaccine encoding the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus genotype IVb glycoprotein confers protection in muskellunge (Esox masquinongy), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush).","The viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is one of the most serious fish pathogens. In 2003, a novel sublineage (genotype IVb) of this deadly virus emerged in the Great Lakes basin causing serious fish kills. We have previously demonstrated that a DNA plasmid (pcDNA), containing a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVb glycoprotein (G) gene insert (designated pVHSivb-G) confers moderate protection in muskellunge (Esox masquinongy), a highly susceptible species upon challenge. In order to achieve optimal protection, we investigated a number of factors including the incubation time [i.e. the number of degree days (° days)] before challenge, and viral challenge dose and route. Additionally, we tested if pVHSivb-G provides protection against VHSV-IVb to less susceptible salmonids such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush).An increase in the period lapsed between vaccination and challenge to 1880° days resulted in 95% relative percent protection (RPS) in muskellunge following a single administration of the pVHSivb-G plasmid and viral challenge. An RPS of 100% for muskellunge was achieved with a longer incubation period (2400° days) and in conjunction with a booster dose of the plasmid. The pVHSivb-G vaccine also elicited significant protection in all three salmonid species, reaching 100% RPS in lake trout following an incubation period of 1001° days prior to viral challenge. Vaccination with pVHSivb-G was also associated with the development of significant levels of circulating VHSV-binding antibodies in muskellunge as measured by indirect ELISA, which reached peak levels 6-7 weeks post-vaccination. Viral shedding in vaccinated survivors was minimal and of transient nature.The study shows that the pVHSivb-G plasmid can elicit a protective response against the wild virus strain in a range of species important in recreational and commercial Great Lakes fisheries.","['DNA vaccine', 'Fish', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Isaac F Standish', 'Elena V Millard', 'Travis O Brenden', 'Mohamed Faisal']"
Development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based diagnostic assays for detection of Pasteurella multocida and hemorrhagic septicemia-associated P multocida serotype B:2.,"OBJECTIVE To develop 2 rapid loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for detection of Pasteurella multocida DNA (Pm-LAMP assay) and P multocida DNA from strains associated with hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) in cattle and buffalo (HS-LAMP assay). SAMPLE Solutions containing 16 P multocida strains and 9 other bacterial species at various concentrations. PROCEDURES Optimal conditions were determined for running the Pm-LAMP and HS-LAMP assays. The assays were then used to detect DNA of the test organisms. Results of LAMP assays were validated against conventional PCR assays designed for specific detection of P multocida and the B:2 serotype of HS-associated strains. RESULTS Following incubation of sample reaction mixtures for 27 minutes, specificity and sensitivity of the HS-LAMP assay at template DNA amounts as low as 5 pg were 93% and 97%, respectively. When duplicates of each sample were incubated for 28 minutes (a positive result defined as positive results for both reactions of a given sample), specificity and sensitivity of the HS-LAMP assay in the same conditions increased to 100%. The best specificity and sensitivity of Pm-LAMP single (93% and 91%) and duplicate (97% and 98%) reactions at template DNA amounts as low as 10 pg were achieved at 33 and 34 minutes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE These preliminary findings suggested the developed HS-LAMP assay had high sensitivity and specificity for detection of HS-associated P multocida. Additional research is needed to determine the accuracy of the assay for use on clinical specimens obtained in HS-endemic countries such as Pakistan and Thailand.",[],"['Ahmed M Moustafa', 'Mark D Bennett']"
Ontogeny of anti-viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) immunity in developing Japanese flounder.,"We examined the ability of developing Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) to acquire protective immunity after exposure to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). Juveniles measuring 9.8 cm average body length were not susceptible to infection with VHSV at 20 °C, while the smaller fish were susceptible. Mortality was not observed after secondary infection at 15 °C in the 9.8 cm cohort that had previously been exposed to the virus at 20 °C, while the smaller fish were susceptible to secondary infection. The expression of interferon (IFN)-related genes was shown to be better developed in larger fish upon virus infection and basal expression levels of the virus recognition proteins were higher in larger fish. Virus-specific antibody was detected in the larger fish, but not in smaller fish. These data indicate that the largest juvenile (9.8 cm) acquired immunity against VHSV infection at the first virus challenge, but smaller fish did not. The anti-viral immune system in the Japanese flounder matures when juveniles reach approximately 10 cm.",[],"['Tomomasa Matsuyama', 'Chihaya Nakayasu', 'Atsushi Fujiwara', 'Jun Kurita', 'Tomokazu Takano', 'Takafumi Ito', 'Motohiko Sano']"
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of HIF-1α gene in epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells inhibited apoptosis and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) growth.,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimer of HIF-1α and HIF-1β, and its key role in the regulation of cellular responses to hypoxia has been well-demonstrated. The participation of HIF-1α in apoptosis has been reported in mammals, however, a little information is available on the role of HIF-1α in the progression of apoptosis in fish. In this study, to know the role of HIF-1α in the apoptosis of fish cells, we produced HIF-1α knockout Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells using a CRISPR/Cas9 vector, and a single cell clone showing a heterozygous insertion/deletion (indel) mutation (one nucleotide insertion and one nucleotide deletion in HIF-1α gene) was chosen for further experiments. To confirm the knockout of HIF-1α, cells were transfected with a hypoxia reporting vector containing hypoxic response elements (HREs). EPC cells transfected with the reporting plasmids showed significantly increased luminescence by exposure to cobalt chloride, a prolyl hydroxylases inhibitor. On the other hand, HIF-1α knockout EPC cells showed a non-responsiveness to a cobalt chloride exposure, suggesting that functional HIF-1α protein was not produced in the HIF-1α knockout EPC cells. Apoptosis progression induced by camptothecin and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection was severely inhibited by HIF-1α knockout, and the replication of VHSV was significantly retarded in HIF-1α knockout EPC cells. These results suggest that HIF-1α in EPC cells acts as a pro-apoptotic factor in the progression of apoptosis triggered by a DNA damaging agent and rhabdoviral infection.",[],"['Min Sun Kim', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
Development of Pasteurella multocida-loaded microparticles for hemorrhagic septicemia vaccine.,"In this study, Pasteurella multocida-loaded alginate microparticles (MPs) for subcutaneous vaccination was developed by emulsification-cross-linking technique. Formulation parameter was varied as a ratio of polymer and bacterin. Optical microscopy revealed spherical particles with uniformly distribution. A mean particle size of approximately 6 µm has been successfully constructed using simple mixer and ultrasonic probe. The zeta potential of the MPs showed negatively charge of approximately -23 mV determined by Zeta Pals® analyzer. The entrapment efficiency and the in vitro bacterin released profile could be controlled by varying the amount of alginate. The high entrapment efficiency up to 69% was achieved with low concentration of alginate. The MPs possessed a slow bacterin release profile, up to 30 days. In vivo safety and potency tests were proved that the alginate MPs were safe and induced protective immunity in mice. In addition, after storage for 6 months at either 4 °C or room temperature, the protective immunity in mice was maintained.

Introduction of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus into Freshwater Cultured Rainbow Trout Is Followed by Bursts of Adaptive Evolution.,"<i>Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus</i> (VHSV), a rhabdovirus infecting teleost fish, has repeatedly crossed the boundary from marine fish species to freshwater cultured rainbow trout. These naturally replicated cross-species transmission events permit the study of general and repeatable evolutionary events occurring in connection with viral emergence in a novel host species. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the adaptive molecular evolution of the VHSV glycoprotein, one of the key virus proteins involved in viral emergence, following emergence from marine species into freshwater cultured rainbow trout. A comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction of the complete coding region of the VHSV glycoprotein was conducted, and adaptive molecular evolution was investigated using a maximum likelihood approach to compare different codon substitution models allowing for heterogeneous substitution rate ratios among amino acid sites. Evidence of positive selection was detected at six amino acid sites of the VHSV glycoprotein, within the signal peptide, the confirmation-dependent major neutralizing epitope, and the intracellular tail. Evidence of positive selection was found exclusively in rainbow trout-adapted virus isolates, and amino acid combinations found at the six sites under positive selection pressure differentiated rainbow trout- from non-rainbow trout-adapted isolates. Furthermore, four adaptive sites revealed signs of recurring identical changes across phylogenetic groups of rainbow trout-adapted isolates, suggesting that repeated VHSV emergence in freshwater cultured rainbow trout was established through convergent routes of evolution that are associated with immune escape.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study is the first to demonstrate that VHSV emergence from marine species into freshwater cultured rainbow trout has been accompanied by bursts of adaptive evolution in the VHSV glycoprotein. Furthermore, repeated detection of the same adaptive amino acid sites across phylogenetic groups of rainbow trout-adapted isolates indicates that adaptation to rainbow trout was established through parallel evolution. In addition, signals of convergent evolution toward the maintenance of genetic variation were detected in the conformation-dependent neutralizing epitope or in close proximity to disulfide bonds involved in the structural conformation of the neutralizing epitope, indicating adaptation to immune response-related genetic variation across freshwater cultured rainbow trout.","['VHSV', 'adaptation', 'convergent evolution', 'host-pathogen interactions', 'negative-strand RNA virus', 'viral emergence', 'viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Anna A Schönherz', 'Roald Forsberg', 'Bernt Guldbrandtsen', 'Albert J Buitenhuis', 'Katja Einer-Jensen']"
Evaluation of blue mussel Mytilus edulis as vector for viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"When viral diseases occur in aquaculture farms, the virus released into the seawater from infected animals can re-infect other susceptible species or accumulate in filter-feeding organisms. We conducted a viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) survivability analysis of blue mussel Mytilus edulis digestive enzymes, viral depuration, and infectivity tests via in vitro and in vivo inoculation to evaluate the infectious state. VHSV particles were not completely digested within 24 h in vitro and were maintained for 7 d in the mussel digestive gland. Mussels cohabitating with naturally VHSV-infected olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus could accumulate the viral particles. Although the viral particles in the gill as the entrance of filter-feeding organisms are infectious, the presence of these particles in the digestive gland were not able to induce cytopathic effects in vitro. Viral particles detected by RT-PCR from bivalve mollusks (Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and mussel) from the field did not produce cytopathic effects in cell culture and did not replicate after intraperitoneal injection into olive flounder. Therefore, VHSV particles in blue mussel might be in a non-infectious stage and the possibilities of VHSV transmission to fish under field conditions are scarce.","['Blue mussel', 'Depuration', 'Digestive gland tissue', 'Survivability', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia']","['Kwang Il Kim', 'Young Chul Kim', 'Woo Ju Kwon', 'Hyun Do Jeong']"
RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of the olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) kidney response to vaccination with heat-inactivated viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) is a highly contagious disease of cultured flounder caused by VHS virus (VHSV). To develop effective VHSV vaccines, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the host's protective response against VHSV. The purpose of this study is to clarify which genes are involved in the protective response of olive flounder after VHSV vaccination. We first injected olive flounder intraperitoneally with 10<sup>7</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> heat-inactivated VHSV vaccine and evaluated the vaccine efficacy at 20 °C. Fish vaccinated with heat-inactivated VHSV were significantly protected compared to non-vaccinated fish, with a relative percentage survival of 83%. To analyze the vaccination-induced changes in the expression profiles of genes, kidneys were collected from control and vaccinated fish at days 1, 3, and 7 after vaccination and global gene expression profiling was carried out by RNA sequencing. The analysis revealed that 15,001 genes were differentially expressed by at least 2-fold between vaccinated fish and non-vaccinated controls. Of these, 58 genes clustered into the acute phase response, Toll-like receptor, interferon-inducible/regulatory proteins, and apoptosis pathways. These data provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective immune response of olive flounder against heat-inactivated VHSV vaccine and might aid future studies to develop a highly immunogenic vaccine against VHSV in flounder.","['Heat-killed vaccine', 'Olive flounder', 'RNA-seq', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Jee Youn Hwang', 'Mun Gyeoung Kwon', 'Sung-Hee Jung', 'Myoung Ae Park', 'Dong-Wook Kim', 'Wang Sik Cho', 'Jeong Woo Park', 'Maeng-Hyun Son']"
Generation and characterization of hagfish variable lymphocyte receptor B against glycoprotein of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"Variable lymphocyte receptors B (VLRBs) are non-immunoglobulin components of the humoral immune system in jawless vertebrates including hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri) and lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). Hagfish VLRBs consist of leucine rich repeat (LRR) modules with a superhydrophobic C-terminal tail, the latter of which leads to extremely low expression levels in recombinant protein technology. Here, we present an artificially oligomerized VLRB (arVLRB) that conjugates via the C4bp oligomerization domain derived from human C4b-binding protein (hC4bp) rather than the superhydrophobic tail. The resulting arVLRB had a tightly multimerized form with seven monomeric VLRB arms and showed high expression and secretion levels in a mammalian expression system. To isolate antigen-specific arVLRB, we constructed large VLRB libraries from hagfish immunized with the fish pathogen, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). The selected arVLRBs were found to recognize various types of antigens, including the recombinant target protein, purified viruses, and progeny viruses, with high antigen binding abilities and specificities. We also performed in vitro affinity maturation of the arVLRBs through LRRCT mutagenesis, and found that this enhanced their antigen-binding properties by at least 125-fold. Our epitope mapping analysis revealed that <sup>37</sup>DWDTPL<sup>42</sup>, which is located in a region conserved among the glycoproteins of all VHSV isolates, is the recognition epitope of the arVLRBs. Thus, our newly developed arVLRB could prove useful in the development of universal diagnostic tools and/or therapeutic agents for the virus. Together, our novel findings provide valuable insights into hagfish VLRB and its potential use as a novel alternative to conventional antibodies for biotechnological applications.","['Affinity maturation', 'Epitope mapping', 'Hagfish', 'In vitro', 'Multivalent VLRB antibody', 'Variable lymphocyte B', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)']","['Jung Seok Lee', 'Jaesung Kim', 'Se Pyeong Im', 'Si Won Kim', 'Jassy Mary S Lazarte', 'Jae Wook Jung', 'Tae Won Gong', 'Young Rim Kim', 'Jeong Ho Lee', 'Hyoung Jun Kim', 'Tae Sung Jung']"
Phylogenetic analysis of the glycoprotein gene of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus from Iranian trout farms points towards a common European origin.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), a member of family Rhabdoviridae and genus Novirhabdoviridae, causes mortality in numerous marine and freshwater hosts located in northern hemisphere. To evaluate the genetic diversity of VHSV from the North and South West of Iran, the sequences of a 1483bp nt region of the glycoprotein gene were determined for four Iranian isolates. These sequences were analysed to evaluate their genetic relatedness with 86 worldwide isolates representing the four known genogroups of VHSV. Phylogenetic analysis by nucleotide sequences showed that all the VHSV isolates studied were closest related to the 19 fresh water strains from Germany grouped within the European genogroup Ia-2. This finding indicates that Iranian VHSV most likely was introduced to Iran by the movement of contaminated fish fry from a source in Europe.

Antiviral effects of extracts from Celosia cristata and Raphanus sativus roots against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus.,"The antiviral activity of an extract mixture from Celosia cristata and Raphanus sativus was tested against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).

In olive flounder that received 5 µg of extract per fish, Mx expression peaked at 48 h after treatment. In contrast, ISG15 and TLR2 expression peaked at 72 h, and that of TLR7 peaked at 48 h, followed by a slight decrease at 72 h, indicating that the antiviral activity was mediated by induction of gene expression involved in the innate immune response.","['Cockscomb', 'Mx', 'Radish', 'TLR7', 'VHSV']","['Yeon Jung Park', 'Chiung Moon', 'Jung-Ha Kang', 'Tae-Jin Choi']"
Isolation and identification of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) from farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Iran.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a rhabdovirus that causes one of the most important fish diseases in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) production industry. During the present study from October 2014 to July 2015, the virus causing viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) was isolated and identified in rainbow trout farms from five of sixteen farms experiencing mass mortalities in six provinces of Iran with major trout production. Cumulative mortalities at VHSV-positive farms ranged from 30 to 70%. Clinical signs of disease included exophthalmia, petechial hemorrhages in the mandible and around the eyes, a swollen abdomen and darkening of the integument, widespread petechiae of the musculature and pyloric regions, severe congestion of the kidney, and pale enlarged livers. In addition, histopathologic examinations of tissues showed severe lesions in muscle, kidney and liver, which were compatible with those already described for VHS. Furthermore, homogenates tissues of diseased fish induced cytopathic effects (CPE) in CHSE-214 cells, and confirmatory diagnosis of VHS was made by RT-PCR reactions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation and identification of VHSV from farmed trout in Iran, which may have originated from Europe.

Efficacy of algal Ecklonia cava extract against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"The inhibition efficacy of an extract from Ecklonia cava (E. cava) was studied to determine whether the extract and compounds exhibited inhibitory activity against VHSV in the fathead minnow (FHM) cell line and following oral administration to the olive flounder. Based on its low toxicity and effective concentration, the E. cava extract (Ext) and compounds (eckol and phlorofucofuroeckol A) were selected for further analysis. In the plaque reduction assay, simultaneous co-exposure of VHSV to Ext, eckol and phlorofucofuroeckol A showed a higher level of inhibition than the pre- and post-exposure groups. The antiviral activity in the FHM cell line was time-dependent and increased with the exposure time with the virus and Ext or the compounds. In the in vivo experiments, different Ext concentrations were orally administered to the olive flounder. In trial I, the relative percent survival (RPS) following oral administration of 500 and 50 μg/g/day of Ext was 31.25% and 12.50%, respectively. In trial II, the RPS for 1000, 500 and 50 μg/g/day of Ext was 31.57%, 0% and 0%, respectively. In trial III, the RPS after 1 and 2 weeks (1000 μg/g/day) of exposure to Ext was 26.31% and 31.57%, respectively. Oral administration of Ext (1000 μg/g/day) significantly induced inflammatory cytokine responses (IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ) at 1 and 2 days post-oral administration (dpa). Additionally, IFN-α/β (7-12 dpa), ISG15 (2, 7 and 10 dpa) and Mx (7-12 dpa) were significantly activated in the olive flounder. In conclusion, we demonstrated an inhibitory ability of the E. cava extract and compounds against VHSV in the FHM cell line. Moreover, oral administration of the E. cava extract to the olive flounder enhanced antiviral immune responses and the efficacy of protection against VHSV, resulting in an anti-viral status in the olive flounder.","['Antiviral immune responses', 'Ecklonia cava (E. cava)', 'Olive flounder', 'Seaweed', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Han-Kook Yang', 'Myung-Hwa Jung', 'Satheesha Avunje', 'Chamilani Nikapitiya', 'So Young Kang', 'Young Bae Ryu', 'Woo Song Lee', 'Sung-Ju Jung']"
Integrated profiling of global metabolomic and transcriptomic responses to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus infection in olive flounder.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is one of the most serious viral pathogen that infects farmed fish. In this study, we measured the replication of VHSV increased steadily at 9, 24, 72, and 120 h after infection and progression of necrosis was observed at 72 hpi. We performed transcriptomic and metabolomics profiling of kidney tissues collected at each infection time using Illumina HiSeq2000 and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectroscopy to investigate the mechanisms of VHSV infection in the kidneys of olive flounder. A total of 13,862 mRNA molecules and 72 metabolites were selected to identify the mechanisms of infection and they were integrated using KEGG pathway database. Six KEGG metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, transport and catabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and energy metabolism, were significantly suppressed, whereas the immune system was activated by VHSV infection. A decrease in levels of amino acids such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine, as well as in their derivative carnitines, was observed after VHSV infection. In addition, an increase in arachidonic acid level was noted. Integrated analysis of transcriptome and metabolome using KEGG pathway database revealed four types of responses in the kidneys of olive flounder to VHSV infection. Among these, the mechanisms related to the immune system and protein synthesis were activated, whereas ATP synthesis and the antioxidant system activity were suppressed. This is the first study describing the mechanisms of metabolic responses to VHSV infection in olive flounder. The results suggest that the suppression of ATP synthesis and antioxidant systems, such as glutathione and peroxisome signaling, could be the cause of necrosis, whereas the activation of the immune system could result in the inflammation of kidney tissue in VHSV-infected olive flounder.","['Integrated profiling', 'Metabolomics', 'Olive flounder', 'Transcriptomics', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Se-Young Cho', 'Yong-Kook Kwon', 'Miso Nam', 'Bipin Vaidya', 'Seok Ryel Kim', 'Sunghoon Lee', 'Joseph Kwon', 'Duwoon Kim', 'Geum-Sook Hwang']"
Complete sequences of 4 viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus IVb isolates and their virulence in northern pike fry.,"Four viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVb isolates were sequenced, their genetic variation explored, and comparative virulence assayed with experimental infections of northern pike Esox lucius fry. In addition to the type strain MI03, the complete 11183 bp genome of the first round goby Neogobius melanostomus isolate from the St. Lawrence River, and the 2013 and 2014 isolates from gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum die-offs in Irondequoit Bay, Lake Ontario and Dunkirk Harbor, Lake Erie were all deep sequenced on an Illumina platform. Mutations documented in the 11 yr since the MI03 index case from Lake St. Clair muskellunge Esox masquinongy showed 87 polymorphisms among the 4 isolates. Twenty-six mutations were non-synonymous and located at 18 different positions within the matrix protein, glycoprotein, non-virion protein, and RNA polymerase genes. The same 4 isolates were used to infect northern pike fry by a single 1 h bath exposure. Cumulative percent mortality varied from 42.5 to 62.5%. VHSV was detected in 57% (41/72) of the survivors at the end of the 21-d trial, suggesting that the virus was not rapidly cleared. Lesions were observed in many of the moribund and dead northern pike, such as hemorrhaging in the skin and fins, as well as hydrocephalus. Mean viral load measured from the trunk and visceral tissues of MI03-infected pike was significantly higher than the quantities detected in fish infected with the most recent isolates of genotype IVb, but there were no differences in cumulative mortality observed.","['Esox lucius', 'Experimental infection', 'Illumina sequencing', 'Northern pike', 'VHSV IVb', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Rodman G Getchell', 'Emily R Cornwell', 'Steven Bogdanowicz', 'Jose Andrés', 'William N Batts', 'Gael Kurath', 'Rachel Breyta', 'Joanna G Choi', 'John M Farrell', 'Paul R Bowser']"
A review of hemorrhagic septicemia in cattle and buffalo.,"Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS), an acute, fatal and septicemic disease of cattle and buffaloes caused by Pasteurella multocida, is important in tropical regions of the world, especially in African and Asian countries. The prevalence of disease has been well documented with predominant isolation of P. multocida serotypes B:2 and E:2. Conventional methods of identification such as serotyping, biotyping, antibiogram determination and pathogenicity as well as molecular methods (P. multocida-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a serogroup B-specific PCR assay, multiplex capsular typing system and loop-mediated isothermal amplification techniques) and characterization (restriction endonuclease analysis, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, repetitive extragenic palidromic PCR and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR analysis) are applied in parallel for rapid epidemiological investigations of HS outbreaks. Although several vaccine formulations including alum precipitated, oil adjuvant and multiple emulsion vaccines are commercially available, the quest for suitable broadly protective HS vaccines with long-lasting immunity is on the upsurge. Concurrently, attempts are being made to unravel the mysteries of the pathogen and its virulence factors, pathogenesis and determinants of protective immunity as well as diversity among strains of P. multocida. This review highlights the advances in these various aspects of HS.",[],"['S B Shivachandra', 'K N Viswas', 'A A Kumar']"
Effect of G gene-deleted recombinant viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (rVHSV-ΔG) on the replication of wild type VHSV in a fish cell line and in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"In an earlier study, we generated a replicon viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) particle that was lacking the G gene in the genome (rVHSV-ΔG), and proved the potential of it as a protective vaccine through the immunization of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) fingerlings. Safety is the most important preconsideration for the development of recombinant live vaccines, and a major concern of propagation-incompetent viral particles would be the possible harmful effect to hosts through the interaction with wild-type viruses. Thus, in the present study, we analyzed the replication of rVHSV-ΔG in the presence of wild-type VHSV and the effect of rVHSV-ΔG on the replication of wild-type VHSV in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells and in olive flounder fingerlings. The replication of wild-type VHSV in EPC cells was severely suppressed when the MOI of rVHSV-ΔG was 0.1 or 0.01, on the other hand, the titers of rVHSV-ΔG were not increased and stayed in a relatively constant according to time lapse. Furthermore, the replication of other novirhabdoviruses, IHNV and HIRRV, was also inhibited by co-infection with high titers of rVHSV-ΔG. There were no big differences in mortalities between groups infected with wild-type VHSV plus rVHSV-ΔG and groups infected with wild-type VHSV alone, when the challenged wild-type VHSV was more than 10(2) PFU/fish. However, a group of fish infected with 10 PFU/fish of wild-type VHSV plus rVHSV-ΔG showed significantly lower and slowly progressing cumulative mortality than a group of fish infected with 10 PFU/fish of wild-type VHSV alone. This result suggests that rVHSV-ΔG has an ability to attenuate the disease progression caused by wild-type VHSV when co-infected with relatively low titers of wild-type VHSV. These results indicate that the propagation-incompetent rVHSV-ΔG would not worsen but attenuate the progression of a disease caused by wild-type VHSV infection. Therefore, rVHSV-ΔG-based vaccines can provide a safe and effective way to control VHSV.

In vitro transcribed dsRNA limits viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)-IVb infection in a novel fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) skin cell line.,"The farming of baitfish, fish used by anglers to catch predatory species, is of economic and ecological importance in North America. Baitfish, including the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), are susceptible to infection from aquatic viruses, such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). VHSV infections can cause mass mortality events and have the potential to be spread to novel water bodies through baitfish as a vector. In this study, a novel skin cell line derived from fathead minnow (FHMskin) is described and its use as a tool to study innate antiviral immune responses and possible therapies is introduced. FHMskin grows optimally in 10% fetal bovine serum and at warmer temperatures, 25-30 °C. FHMskin is susceptible and permissive to VHSV-IVb infection, producing high viral titres of 7.35 × 10<sup>7</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL after only 2 days. FHMskin cells do not experience significant dsRNA-induced death after treatment with 50-500 ng/mL of in vitro transcribed dsRNA for 48 h and respond to dsRNA treatment by expressing high levels of three innate immune genes, viperin, ISG15, and Mx1. Pretreatment with dsRNA for 24 h significantly protected cells from VHSV-induced cell death, 500 ng/mL of dsRNA reduced cell death from 70% to less than 15% at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Thus, the novel cell line, FHMskin, represents a new method for producing high tires of VHSV-IVb in culture, and for studying dsRNA-induced innate antiviral responses, with future applications in dsRNA-based antiviral therapeutics.","['Antiviral immunity', 'Fathead minnow', 'Interferon-stimulated genes', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus', 'dsRNA']","['Sarah J Poynter', 'Eric M Leis', 'Stephanie J DeWitte-Orr']"
Increase of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus growth by knockout of IRF9 gene in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) has been a notorious pathogen in freshwater and marine fish. Due to the lack of effective treatment measures against VHSV disease, the development of prophylactic vaccines has been required, and methods that can produce high-titered viruses would be advantageous in producing cost-effective vaccines. Type I interferon (IFN) responses are the key elements of vertebrates' antiviral activities, and IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex formed through type I IFNs up-regulates the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) is a key component of ISGF3, so the inhibition of IRF9 would compromise host's type I IFN responses, which would weaken host antiviral activity. In this study, to increase the replication of VHSV, we generated IRF9 knockout Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells using a CRISPR/Cas9 vector that contains an EPC cell's U6 promoter-driven guide RNA cassette (targeting IRF9 gene) and a Cas9 expressing cassette. In the clones of IRF9 knockout EPC cells, there were no increase in ISG15 gene by poly I:C, and in Mx1 gene by both poly I:C and VHSV. Interestingly, although the increased folds were conspicuously lower than control EPC cells, the expression of ISG 15 gene in all the IRF9 knockout clones was significantly increased by VHSV infection. Control EPC cells pre-treated with poly I:C did not show any CPE when infected with VHSV, however, IRF9 knockout EPC cells showed CPE by VHSV infection in spite of being pretreated with poly I:C. The replication of VHSV in IRF9 knockout EPC cells was significantly faster and higher than that in control EPC cells indicating that the IRF9 knockout-mediated decrease of type I IFN responses allowed VHSV to replicate efficiently. Considering an economical aspect for the production of fish vaccines, the present IRF9 knockout EPC cells can be used to get higher-titered VHSV.","['CRISPR/Cas9', 'IRF9 knockout', 'Type I interferon response', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus', 'Virus titer']","['Min Sun Kim', 'Min Jun Shin', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
Expression and characterization of monomeric variable lymphocyte receptor B specific to the glycoprotein of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"Monomeric variable lymphocyte receptor B (VLRB) is one of the smallest binding scaffold (20-25 kDa) from jawless vertebrates, hagfish and lamprey. This relatively new class of binding scaffold has various advantages: i) it has a single peptide composition, amenable to molecular engineering for enhancing its stability and affinity; ii) it has a small size, contributing better tissue penetration and easier production using microorganism expression system. Monomeric arVLRB142, which can specifically bind to the glycoprotein of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), was expressed in Pichia pastoris. High quantity recombinant monomeric arVLRB142 (rVLR142<sup>mono</sup>) was purified from 100 ml of culture with a resulting yield of 2.6 ±1.3 mg of target protein. Functional studies revealed that the purified rVLR142<sup>mono</sup> can specifically recognize low levels of the target antigen (recombinant glycoprotein) (i.e. as low as 0.1 nM), but also the native glycoprotein of VHSV. The expressed rVLR142<sup>mono</sup> exhibited high levels of stability and it retained it binding capacity over broad temperature (4 °C ~ 60 °C) and pH ranges (pH 1.5-12.5). We developed an effective expression system for mass production of monomeric VLRB based on P. pastoris. The recombinant protein that was obtained offers promising binding avidity and biophysical stability and its potential use in various biotechnological applications.","['Hagfish', 'Heterogeneous expression', 'Pichia pastoris', 'Variable lymphocyte receptor B (VLRB)', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)']","['Jung Seok Lee', 'Jaesung Kim', 'Se Pyeong Im', 'Si Won Kim', 'Jae Wook Jung', 'Jassy Mary S Lazarte', 'Jeong-Ho Lee', 'Kim D Thompson', 'Tae Sung Jung']"
"A novel approach for development, standardization, and safety testing of enriched alum-precipitated vaccine against hemorrhagic septicemia in different breeds of cattle.","Hemorrhagic septicemia is a fatal disease of cattle and buffalo all over the world including Pakistan and it causes heavy economic losses every year. The poor farmers cannot bear this loss in the form of less milk production and heavy expenditures on the animal treatment. An enriched alum-precipitated vaccine with reduced dose was prepared and standardized and safety testing of enriched vaccine was performed in Swiss albino mice as well as in natural host. In this experiment, a total of 36 cattle both male and female of different age groups ranging from 4 months to 4 years were used. All these animals belong to all major cattle breeds of Pakistan including Sahiwal, Red Sindhi (crossbred and purebred), Dhani (crossbred and purebred), Lohani (crossbred and purebred), and Cholistani, and exotic breeds including Holstein Friesian and Jersey. These animals were examined for current immune titer prior to vaccination. Animals were vaccinated subcutaneously with 2 mL and 4 mL dose of new vaccine and were observed for any untoward reaction for 48 h. All the animals were kept under close observation for the next 30 days and all were found safe. The experiment was designed to reduce the dose of the vaccine to 2 mL by using BHI as a growth medium, as well as to increase the number of doses prepared in the same infrastructure, hence reducing the cost of vaccine production. The study proved that vaccine with increased biomass in reduced dose is safe in local as well as in exotic breeds of cattle.","['Blood chemistry', 'Cattle breeds', 'Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS)', 'Immune titer', 'Safety testing', 'Vaccine']","['Muhammad Zahid Farooq', 'Sumiyya Sattar', 'Hina Afroz', 'Asfa Rasool']"
Role of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus Matrix (M) Protein in Suppressing Host Transcription.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a pathogenic fish rhabdovirus found in discrete locales throughout the Northern Hemisphere. VHSV infection of fish cells leads to upregulation of the host's virus detection response, but the virus quickly suppresses interferon (IFN) production and antiviral gene expression. By systematically screening each of the six VHSV structural and nonstructural genes, we identified matrix protein (M) as the virus' most potent antihost protein. Only M of VHSV genotype IV sublineage b (VHSV-IVb) suppressed mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and type I IFN-induced gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. M also suppressed the constitutively active simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter and globally decreased cellular RNA levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies illustrated that M inhibited RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) recruitment to gene promoters and decreased RNAP II C-terminal domain (CTD) Ser2 phosphorylation during VHSV infection. However, transcription directed by RNAP I to III was suppressed by M. To identify regions of functional importance, M proteins from a variety of VHSV strains were tested in cell-based transcriptional inhibition assays. M of a particular VHSV-Ia strain, F1, was significantly less potent than IVb M at inhibiting SV40/luciferase (Luc) expression yet differed by just 4 amino acids. Mutation of D62 to alanine alone, or in combination with an E181-to-alanine mutation (D62A E181A), dramatically reduced the ability of IVb M to suppress host transcription. Introducing either M D62A or D62A E181A mutations into VHSV-IVb via reverse genetics resulted in viruses that replicated efficiently but exhibited less cytotoxicity and reduced antitranscriptional activities, implicating M as a primary regulator of cytopathicity and host transcriptional suppression.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Viruses must suppress host antiviral responses to replicate and spread between hosts. In these studies, we identified the matrix protein of the deadly fish novirhabdovirus VHSV as a critical mediator of host suppression during infection. Our studies indicated that M alone could block cellular gene expression at very low expression levels. We identified several subtle mutations in M that were less potent at suppressing host transcription. When these mutations were engineered back into recombinant viruses, the resulting viruses replicated well but elicited less toxicity in infected cells and activated host innate immune responses more robustly. These data demonstrated that VHSV M plays an important role in mediating both virus-induced cell toxicity and viral replication. Our data suggest that its roles in these two processes can be separated to design effective attenuated viruses for vaccine candidates.","['MAVS', 'VHSV', 'matrix protein', 'transcriptional inhibition']","['Qi Ke', 'Wade Weaver', 'Adam Pore', 'Bartolomeo Gorgoglione', 'Julia Halo Wildschutte', 'Peng Xiao', 'Brian S Shepherd', 'Allyn Spear', 'Krishnamurthy Malathi', 'Carol A Stepien', 'Vikram N Vakharia', 'Douglas W Leaman']"
Viral hemorrhagic septicemia and infectious pancreatic necrosis viruses replicate differently in rainbow trout gonad and induce different chemokine transcription profiles.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) are two rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) pathogens. While IPNV is known to be vertically transmitted to the next generation through the oocyte, VHSV is known to replicate in the ovary and be transmitted horizontally through the ovarian fluid. In this work, we wanted to study whether these differences had an effect on the immune response triggered in the ovary, with a focus on the chemokine response. We have studied the kinetics of viral gene expression and the sites of replication, confirming that great differences exist between the replication of the two viruses in the gonad. Next, we studied the levels of expression of several CXC and CC chemokines in the ovary and found that while VHSV strongly triggered chemokine transcription, IPNV had almost no effect. This lack of immune response might be an advantage that permits its vertical transmission.",[],"['Elena Chaves-Pozo', 'Jana Montero', 'Alberto Cuesta', 'Carolina Tafalla']"
Re-emergence of bovine haemorrhagic septicaemia in Hungary.,"This paper reports an outbreak of haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by Pasteurella multocida B:2 in beef calves, a disease that has not been described in the Hungarian literature since 1943, and has not been reported to the World Organisation For Animal Health (OIE) since 1970. Acute haemorrhagic septicaemia was confirmed in beef calves on one small farm, and was suspected on two further nearby holdings with concomitant unexplained losses. The source of the infection could not be determined. Apart from a short duration of depression and loss of appetite, the affected calves developed characteristic distal limb oedema. Gross findings in two calves submitted for laboratory examinations included subcutaneous oedema and haemorrhages on serous membranes, and in one case severe pharyngeal lymph node enlargement was observed. Histological examinations revealed lesions characteristic of septicaemia. Moderate to large amounts of Pasteurella antigens were detected in all organs tested by immunohistochemistry. Two isolates of P. multocida (Pm240, Pm241) were cultured from these cases and examined in detail. These were identified as P. multocida ssp. multocida biovar 3. Both were toxA negative and belonged to serotype B:2. Multilocus sequence typing was used to assign these to a new sequence type (ST64) that is closely related to other haemorrhagic septicaemia causing strains of P. multocida regardless of the host.","['Pasteurella multocida', 'beef cattle', 'capsular type B', 'haemorrhagic septicaemia', 'histopathology', 'immunohistochemistry', 'multilocus sequence typing']","['Tibor Magyar', 'Barbara Ujvári', 'Levente Szeredi', 'Norbert Virsinger', 'Ervin Albert', 'Zoltán Német', 'Edit Csuka', 'Imre Biksi']"
Influence of Temperature on the Efficacy of Homologous and Heterologous DNA Vaccines against Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia in Pacific Herring.,"Homologous and heterologous (genogroup Ia) DNA vaccines against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (genogroup IVa) conferred partial protection in Pacific Herring Clupea pallasii. Early protection at 2 weeks postvaccination (PV) was low and occurred only at an elevated temperature (12.6°C, 189 degree days), where the relative percent survival following viral exposure was similar for the two vaccines (IVa and Ia) and higher than that of negative controls at the same temperature. Late protection at 10 weeks PV was induced by both vaccines but was higher with the homologous vaccine at both 9.0°C and 12.6°C. Virus neutralization titers were detected among 55% of all vaccinated fish at 10 weeks PV. The results suggest that the immune response profile triggered by DNA vaccination of herring was similar to that reported for Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss by Lorenzen and LaPatra in 2005, who found interferon responses in the early days PV and the transition to adaptive response later. However, the protective effect was far less prominent in herring, possibly reflecting different physiologies or adaptations of the two fish species.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia IVb status in the United States: inferences from surveillance activities and regional context.,"The United States (U.S.) response to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) IVb emergence in the Laurentian Great Lakes (GL) included risk-based surveillance for cost-effective decision support regarding the health of fish populations in open systems. All U.S. VHSV IVb isolations to date derive from free-ranging fish from GL States. Most originate in the region designated by US Geological Survey hydrologic unit code (HUC) 04, with the exception of two detections in neighboring Upper Mississippi (HUC 05) and Ohio (HUC 07) regions. For States outside the GL system, disease probability was assessed using multiple evidence sources. None substantiated VHSV IVb absence using surveillance alone, in part due to the limited temporal relevance of data in open systems. However, Bayesian odds risk-based analysis of surveillance and population context, coupled with exclusions where water temperatures likely preclude viral replication, achieved VHSV IVb freedom assurance for 14 non-GL States by the end of 2012, with partial evidence obtained for another 17 States. The non-GL region (defined as the aggregate of 4-digit HUCs located outside of GL States) met disease freedom targets for 2012 and is projected to maintain this status through 2016 without additional active surveillance. Projections hinge on continued basic biosecurity conditions such as movement restrictions and passive surveillance. Areas with navigable waterway connections to VHSV IVb-affected HUCs (and conducive water temperatures) should receive priority for resources in future surveillance or capacity building efforts. However, 6 years of absence of detections in non-GL States suggests that existing controls limit pathogen spread, and that even spread via natural pathways (e.g., water movement or migratory fish) appears contained to the Great Lakes system. This report exemplifies the cost-effective use of risk-based surveillance in decision support to assess and manage aquatic animal population health in open systems.

Expression kinetics of key genes in the early innate immune response to Great Lakes viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus IVb infection in yellow perch (Perca flavescens).,"The recently discovered strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, VHSV-IVb, represents an example of the introduction of an extremely pathogenic rhabdovirus capable of infecting a wide variety of new fish species in a new host-environment.

Administration of VHSV-IVb by IP-injection into juvenile yellow perch resulted in 84% cumulative mortality, indicating their high susceptibility to this disease. In fish sampled in the very early stages of infection, a significant up-regulation of Mx gene expression in the liver, as well as IL-1β and SAA activation in the head kidney, spleen, and liver was directly correlated to viral load.

Changes in microRNAs expression profile of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) in response to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection.,"To know the effect of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection on the cellular microRNA expression profile in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), fish were infected with VHSV, and cellular microRNAs expression was analyzed at 0 (control), 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection (h.p.i.) by the high-throughput sequencing. A total of 372 mature miRNAs were identified, and, among them, 63 miRNAs were differentially expressed during VHSV infection. The differentially expressed microRNAs number was greatly increased from 24 h.p.i. compared to the number at 6 and 12 h.p.i., suggesting that the alteration of microRNAs expression by VHSV infection may be related to the progression of VHSV disease. The target prediction analysis, the GO enrichment analysis, and the KEGG pathway analysis of the predicted target genes showed that various biological pathways could be affected by VHSV infection through the down-regulation or up-regulation of host miRNAs. The present results provide a basic information on the microRNAs related to VHSV infection in olive flounder.

Optimization of a Plaque Neutralization Test (PNT) to Identify the Exposure History of Pacific Herring to Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV).,"Methods for a plaque neutralization test (PNT) were optimized for the detection and quantification of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) neutralizing activity in the plasma of Pacific Herring Clupea pallasii. The PNT was complement dependent, as neutralizing activity was attenuated by heat inactivation; further, neutralizing activity was mostly restored by the addition of exogenous complement from specific-pathogen-free Pacific Herring. Optimal methods included the overnight incubation of VHSV aliquots in serial dilutions (starting at 1:16) of whole test plasma containing endogenous complement. The resulting viral titers were then enumerated using a viral plaque assay in 96-well microplates. Serum neutralizing activity was virus-specific as plasma from viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) survivors demonstrated only negligible reactivity to infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, a closely related rhabdovirus. Among Pacific Herring that survived VHSV exposure, neutralizing activity was detected in the plasma as early as 37 d postexposure and peaked at approximately 64 d postexposure. The onset of neutralizing activity was slightly delayed in fish reared at 7.4°C relative to those in warmer temperatures (9.9°C and 13.1°C); however, neutralizing activity persisted for at least 345 d postexposure in all temperature treatments. It is anticipated that this novel ability to assess VHSV neutralizing activity in Pacific Herring will enable retrospective comparisons between prior VHS infections and year-class recruitment failures. Additionally, the optimized PNT could be employed as a forecasting tool capable of identifying the potential for future VHS epizootics in wild Pacific Herring populations.

Comparison of the efficacy of Poly(I:C) immunization with live vaccine and formalin-killed vaccine against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) in olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, causes significant economic loss for the flounder aquaculture industry in Korea. In this study, the immunogenicity of Poly(I:C) immunization with a live vaccine against the VHS virus (VHSV) was compared with that of a formalin-treated vaccine in the olive flounder. In vaccine trial I, fish pre-injected with Poly(I:C) were highly protected from VHSV infection 2 d later (survival rate: 96%) and the surviving fish (Poly(I:C)-VHSV group) showed a 100% survival rate against VHSV re-challenge. Mortality in fish pre-injected with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water followed by injection with formalin-treated VHSV was only 2% (1 of 50 fish), whereas survivors (DEPC-FT VHSV group) showed an 80% survival rate. In vaccine trial II, 100% survival was observed in all Poly(I:C) vaccination groups-Poly(I:C)-VHSV 6, Poly(I:C)-VHSV 5, and Poly(I:C)-VHSV 4. In contrast, the survival rates of the groups administered the formalin-treated VHSV at a dose of 10(6), 10(5), and 10(4) TCID50 100 μL(-1) fish(-1) (DEPC-FT VHSV 6, DEPC-FT VHSV 5, and DEPC-FT VHSV 4) were only 8%, 12%, and 12%, respectively. The differences in the survival rates of the formalin-treated vaccine groups in trial I and trial II were attributed to the difference in the formalin-treatment period: the formalin-treated VHSV administered in trial I was not completely inactivated and worked as a live vaccine, which explains the 80% survival rate against VHSV challenge. Specific antibodies against VHSV were detected in sera from all vaccinated survivors, except the DEPC-VHSV 4 group. Furthermore, the specific antibody titers of fish vaccinated with the live and dead VHSV vaccines were similar, but the protective effects of the live and dead vaccines varied considerably. Our findings show that Poly(I:C) immunization with the live vaccine offers better protection than the formalin-treated vaccine against VHS in olive flounder and revealed that antibody levels are not a reliable indicator of the protective effect of the vaccine against the pathogen. In the future, elements of T cell immunity may be used as a means of evaluating the protective efficacy of a vaccine against VHSV instead of ELISA.

Dextran-Conjugated Lysozymes Inhibit the Growth of <i>Shigella sonnei</i> and Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus.,"Lysozyme is well known as a natural antimicrobial agent, but its function is limited in that it only combats Gram-positive bacteria. We investigated the inhibitory effects of dextran-conjugated lysozymes (DLs) against some strains of Gram-negative bacteria and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). The Maillard reactions of the DL were performed at various pHs (3.0, 7.0, and 8.5) in the presence of saturated KBr solution for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days. The growth inhibition effects against Gram-negative bacterial strains, such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Shigella sonnei</i>, and <i>Shigella flexneri</i> were found only in some DLs. DLs incubated at pH 7.0 for 9 days strongly inhibited growth of <i>S. sonnei</i> (92.9%). Fathead minnow (FHM) cells were infected with VHSV. DLs treated at all pHs for 1 day resulted in more than 80% viability of VHSV-infected FHM cells. The results of this study suggest that our DLs can be useful in food preservatives, pharmaceuticals, or aquatic feed due to their inhibitory effects against pathogenic bacteria and viral infections.","['Shigella sonnei', 'denatured lysozyme', 'dextran', 'viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Joongjae Lee', 'Inyong Kim', 'Seoungsoon Yeo', 'Duwoon Kim', 'Misook Kim']"

Screening for viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in marine fish along the Norwegian coastal line.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infects a wide range of marine fish species. To study the occurrence of VHSV in wild marine fish populations in Norwegian coastal waters and fjord systems a total of 1927 fish from 39 different species were sampled through 5 research cruises conducted in 2009 to 2011. In total, VHSV was detected by rRT-PCR in twelve samples originating from Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and silvery pout (Gadiculus argenteus). All fish tested positive in gills while four herring and one silvery pout also tested positive in internal organs. Successful virus isolation in cell culture was only obtained from one pooled Atlantic herring sample which shows that today's PCR methodology have a much higher sensitivity than cell culture for detection of VHSV. Sequencing revealed that the positive samples belonged to VHSV genotype Ib and phylogenetic analysis shows that the isolate from Atlantic herring and silvery pout are closely related. All positive fish were sampled in the same area in the northern county of Finnmark. This is the first detection of VHSV in Atlantic herring this far north, and to our knowledge the first detection of VHSV in silvery pout. However, low prevalence of VHSV genotype Ib in Atlantic herring and other wild marine fish are well known in other parts of Europe. Earlier there have been a few reports of disease outbreaks in farmed rainbow trout with VHSV of genotype Ib, and our results show that there is a possibility of transfer of VHSV from wild to farmed fish along the Norwegian coast line. The impact of VHSV on wild fish is not well documented. ",[],"['Nina Sandlund', 'Britt Gjerset', 'Øivind Bergh', 'Ingebjørg Modahl', 'Niels Jørgen Olesen', 'Renate Johansen']"
Immune response of heterologous recombinant antigenic protein of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in mice.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) is an important infectious disease in fish worldwide caused by viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). VHSV is the causative agent of serious systemic diseases in fish, affecting a number of teleost fish species. In this study, VHSV glycoprotein (G), including its epitope, as a subunit vaccine candidate, was expressed in tobacco plant (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). The recombinant gene, VHSVG, was fused to the immunoglobulin Fc fragment and extended with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (KDEL) to generate VHSVG-FcK. The recombinant expression vector for VHSVG-FcK was transferred into <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> (LBA4404), and plant transformation was conducted <i>N. tabacum</i>. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to confirm gene insertion and VHSVG-FcK protein expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. VHSVG-FcK protein was successfully purified from tobacco plant leaves. Furthermore, ELISA analysis showed that mice serum immunized with the plant-derived VHSVG-FcK (VHSVGP-FcK) had a high absorbance against VHSVG-FcK, indicating that the plant-derived recombinant subunit vaccine protein VHSVG-FcK can induce immune response. Taken together, this recombinant vaccine protein can be expressed in plant expression systems and can be appropriately assembled to be functional in immunogenicity.","['Plant expression system', 'VHSV', 'VHSVG-FcK', 'vaccine']","['Chunha Shin', 'Yangjoo Kang', 'Heui-Soo Kim', 'Yong Kyoo Shin', 'Kisung Ko']"
Identification of regulators of the early stage of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus infection during curcumin treatment.,"The effect of curcumin pretreatment (15-240 μM) in fathead minnow cells infected with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was evaluated. Cell viability, apoptosis and viral copy number were analyzed using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, Annexin V staining, and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively. Pretreatment with 120 μM curcumin showed an increase in viability (>90% of mock) of VHSV-infected cells and reduction in the copy number (0.2-log reduction in VHSV N gene expression), reactive oxygen species and apoptosis in the cells without cytotoxic effects. To understand the mechanisms underlaying the antiviral effects of curcumin pretreatment, a comparative proteomic analysis was performed in four samples (M, mock; C, curcumin-treated; V, VHSV-infected; and CV, curcumin-treated VHSV-infected) in triplicate. In total, 185 proteins were detected. The analysis showed that three proteins, including heat shock cognate 71 (HSC71), actin, alpha cardiac muscle (ACTC1) and elongation factor 1 (EEF1) were differentially expressed between V and CV samples. Network analysis performed by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) showed that HSC71 was the primary protein interacting with fibronectin (FN) 1, actins (ACTB, ACTG, F-actin) and gelsolin (GSN) in both V and CV samples and thus is a strong target candidate for the protection from VHSV infection at the viral entry stage. Our proteomics data suggest that curcumin pretreatment inhibits entry of VHSV in cells by downregulating FN1 or upregulating F-actin. For both proteins, HSC71 acts as a binding protein that modulates their functions. Furthermore, consistent with the effect of a heat shock protein inhibitor (KNK437), curcumin downregulated HSC71 expression with increasing viability of VHSV-infected cells and inhibited VHSV replication, suggesting that the downregulation of HSC71 could be responsible for the antiviral activity of curcumin. In conclusion, this study indicates that the suppression of viral entry by rearrangement of the F-actin/G-actin ratio via downregulating HSC71 is a plausible mechanism by which curcumin pretreatment controls the early stages of VHSV infection.","['Curcumin', 'Heat shock cognate 71', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Eun-Hye Jeong', 'Bipin Vaidya', 'Se-Young Cho', 'Myoung-Ae Park', 'Kusuma Kaewintajuk', 'Seok Ryel Kim', 'Myung-Joo Oh', 'Jong-Soon Choi', 'Joseph Kwon', 'Duwoon Kim']"
Efficacy of an inactivated recombinant vaccine encoding a fimbrial protein of Pasteurella multocida B:2 against hemorrhagic septicemia in goats.,"This study was carried out to determine the antibody responses and protective capacity of an inactivated recombinant vaccine expressing the fimbrial protein of Pasteurella multocida B:2 following intranasal vaccination against hemorrhagic septicemia in goats. Goats were vaccinated intranasal with 10(6) CFU/mL of the recombinant vaccine (vaccinated group) and 10(6) CFU/mL of pET32/LIC vector without fimbrial protein (control group). All three groups were kept separated before all goats in the three groups were challenged with 10(9) CFU/mL of live pathogenic P. multocida B:2. During the course of study, both serum and lung lavage fluid were collected to evaluate the antibody levels via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. It was found that goats immunized with the inactivated recombinant vaccine developed a strong and significantly (p < 0.05) higher specific IgA and IgG responses in both serum and lung lavage fluid samples compared to the control and unvaccinated groups. Following intratracheal challenge, the rate of isolation was 17% for the vaccinated group, 67% for the control group and 100% for the unvaccinated group. However, none of the goat from the vaccinated group had P. multocida B:2 in the liver, tonsil and heart. Therefore, the study revealed that an inactivated recombinant vaccine significantly provides significant protection against high dose challenge and enhances the stimulation of the local and systemic immunities.",[],"['Ina-Salwany Mohd Yasin', 'Sabri Mohd Yusoff', 'Zamri-Saad Mohd', 'Effendy Abd Wahid Mohd']"
A single amino acid mutation (I1012F) of the RNA polymerase of marine viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus changes in vitro virulence to rainbow trout gill epithelial cells.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is separated into four different genotypes (I to IV) with different sublineages (K. Einer-Jensen, P. Ahrens, R. Forsberg, and N. Lorenzen, J. Gen. Virol. 85:1167-1179, 2004; K. Einer-Jensen, J. Winton, and N. Lorenzen, Vet. Microbiol. 106:167-178, 2005). European marine VHSV strains (of genotypes I to III) are, in general, nonpathogenic or have very low pathogenicity to rainbow trout after a waterborne challenge, and here we also show that genotype IVa is nonpathogenic to trout. Despite several attempts, it has not been possible to link genomic variation to in vivo virulence. In vitro virulence to gill epithelial cells (GECs) has been used as a proxy for in vivo virulence, and here we extend these studies further with the purpose of identifying residues associated with in vitro virulence. Genotype Ia (DK-3592B) and III (NO/650/07) isolates, which are pathogenic to rainbow trout (O. B. Dale, I. Orpetveit, T. M. Lyngstad, S. Kahns, H. F. Skall, N. J. Olesen, and B. H. Dannevig, Dis. Aquat. Organ. 85:93-103, 2009), were compared to two marine strains that are nonpathogenic to trout, genotypes Ib (strain 1p8 [H. F. Mortensen, O. E. Heuer, N. Lorenzen, L. Otte, and N. J. Olesen, Virus Res. 63:95-106, 1999]) and IVa (JF-09). DK-3592 and NO/650/07 were pathogenic to GECs, while marine strains 1p8 and JF-09 were nonpathogenic to GECs. Eight conserved amino acid substitutions contrasting high- and low-virulence strains were identified, and reverse genetics was used in a gain-of-virulence approach based on the JF-09 backbone. Mutations were introduced into the G, NV, and L genes, and seven different virus clones were obtained. For the first time, we show that a single amino acid mutation in conserved region IV of the L protein, I1012F, rendered the virus able to replicate and induce a cytopathic effect in trout GECs. The other six mutated variants remained nonpathogenic.This is the first study to clearly link in vitro virulence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) with an amino acid residue in the L protein, a site located in conserved region IV of the L protein. In vitro virulence is documented by induction of cytopathic effects and viability studies of gill epithelial cells, and the observed cellular responses to infection are associated with increased viral replication levels. There are no previous studies addressing the importance of the L protein or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for virus virulence in vitro or in vivo. Therefore, the findings reported here should broaden the search for pathogenicity traits in novirhabdoviruses, and there is a possibility that the polymerase participates in defining the host species virulence of various VHSV strains.",[],"['Sung-Hyun Kim', 'Beate J Thu', 'Helle F Skall', 'Niccolò Vendramin', 'Oystein Evensen']"
Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus glycoprotein production in tobacco.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) causes mortality in numerous marine and freshwater fish species resulting in heavy losses in fish farming. The glycoprotein gene of VHSV was fused with the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and expressed transiently in leaf tissues of Nicotiana benthamiana via the agroinfiltration method. The glycoprotein gene was divided into two parts to improve assembly of CTB fusion proteins (CTB-VHSV<sub>99-235</sub> and CTB-VHSV<sub>258-417</sub>). Production of CTB fusion proteins was confirmed in the agroinfiltrated leaf tissue by western blot analysis. The plant-produced CTB fusion proteins showed biological activity to G<sub>M1</sub>-ganglioside, a receptor for biologically active CTB, on G<sub>M1</sub>-ELISA. The expression level of the CTB-VHSV fusion proteins was 0.86% (CTB-VHSV<sub>99-235</sub>) and 0.93% (CTB-VHSV<sub>258-417</sub>) of total proteins in agroinfiltrated leaf tissue, as determined by G<sub>M1</sub>-ELISA. These results suggest that Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of CTB fusion antigens of VHSV is a rapid and convenient method and demonstrate the feasibility of using agroinfiltrated plant leaf tissues expressing CTB-fusion antigens as a plant-based vaccine to prevent VHSV infection.","['Cholera toxin B subunit', 'Glycoprotein', 'Plant-based vaccine', 'Transient expression', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Nguyen-Quang-Duc Tien', 'Tae-Jung Kim', 'Tae-Geum Kim']"
"Effects of a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, on viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection-mediated apoptosis and viral replication.","In the development of inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines for cultured fish, viral titers harvested from the cultured cells would be the most important factor for the determination of vaccine's cost effectiveness. In this study, we hypothesized that the lengthening of cell survival time by the inhibition of apoptosis can lead to an increase of the final titer of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). To test the hypothesis, we investigated the effects of a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, on VHSV infection-mediated apoptosis in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells and on the VHSV titers. VHSV infection induced the DNA laddering in EPC cells, and the progression of DNA fragmentation was in proportion to the CPE extension. The progression of DNA fragmentation in EPC cells infected with VHSV was clearly inhibited by exposure to Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, and the inhibition was intensified according to the increase of the inhibitor concentration. These results confirmed the previous reports that the death of host cells by VHSV infection is through apoptosis. Cells infected with a recombinant VHSV, rVHSV-ΔNV-eGFP, that was generated from our previous study by replacement of the NV gene ORF with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene ORF, showed earlier and more distinct DNA fragmentations compared to the cells infected with wild-type VHSV, suggesting the inhibitory role of the NV protein in VHSV-mediated apoptosis that was previously reported. The final viral titers in the supernatant isolated from Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK treated cells after showing an extensive CPE were significantly higher than the viral titers from cells infected with virus alone, indicating that the delay of apoptosis by Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK extended the survival time of EPC cells, which lengthen the time for VHSV replication in the cells. In conclusion, Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK-mediated inhibition of apoptosis significantly increased the final titers of both wild-type VHSV and rVHSV-ΔNV-eGFP, indicating that apoptosis inhibition can be a way to get higher titers of VHSV.

Development and evaluation of a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and virus neutralization assay to detect antibodies to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a target of surveillance by many state and federal agencies in the United States. Currently, the detection of VHSV relies on virus isolation, which is lethal to fish and indicates only the current infection status. A serological method is required to ascertain prior exposure. Here, we report two serologic tests for VHSV that are nonlethal, rapid, and species independent, a virus neutralization (VN) assay and a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results show that the VN assay had a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 42.9%; the anti-nucleocapsid-blocking ELISA detected nonneutralizing VHSV antibodies at a specificity of 88.2% and a sensitivity of 96.4%. The VN assay and ELISA are valuable tools for assessing exposure to VHSV.

Stability and efficacy of the 3'-UTR A4G-G5A variant of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) as a live attenuated immersion VHSV vaccine in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is the causative agent of viral hemorrhagic septicemia in fish, a disease that affects a number of teleost fish species including olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). In this study, we assessed the safety and efficacy of two recombinant attenuated VHSV strains, termed A4G-G5A and ΔNV, with the purpose to select the most suitable vaccine strain. The virus strains were passaged in two commercially available cell lines, EPC and RTG-2, and the strains were also tested for residual virulence in zebrafish (Danio rerio). The A4G-G5A strain showed an attenuated growth profile in both the EPC and RTG-2 cell lines compared to wild-type (WT) VHSV (JF-09, genotype IVa), whereas the growth profile of ΔNV was comparable to the WT strains in RTG-2 cells in contrast to EPC cells. Moreover, ΔNV had higher residual virulence compared to A4G-G5A and was highly pathogenic to zebrafish. The A4G-G5A strain was chosen as vaccine candidate and tested for efficacy in in vivo fish studies in the target species, olive flounder, using an immersion vaccine scheme. Groups of fish were immunized with 10(2.5), 10(3.5), 10(4.5), and 10(5.5) TCID50/ml of A4G-G5A giving 5-13.3 cumulative percent mortality (CPM) post immunization. Immunization was followed by a challenge experiment using VHSV-WT. The relative percent survival (RPS) in immunized groups ranged from 81.6% to 100%, correlating with vaccination dose. This study demonstrates that while strain A4G-G5A has retained some residual virulence it confers high level of protection in immunized olive flounder.

Use of Poly(I:C) Stabilized with Chitosan As a Vaccine-Adjuvant Against Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus Infection in Zebrafish.,"There is an urgent need for more efficient viral vaccines in finfish aquaculture worldwide. Here, we report the use of poly(I:C) stabilized with chitosan as an adjuvant for development of better finfish vaccines. The adjuvant was co-injected with inactivated viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) (CSpIC+iV vaccine) in adult zebrafish and its efficiency in protection against VHSV infection was compared to a live, attenuated VHS virus vaccine (aV). Both free and stabilized poly(I:C) were strong inducers of an antiviral state, measured by transcriptional activation of the genes of viral sensors: toll-like receptors, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes, such as MXa within 48 h after injection. Both the CSpIC+iV and the aV formulations provided a significant protection against VHSV-induced mortality. However, when plasma from survivors was tested for neutralizing antibodies in an in vitro protection assay, we could not demonstrate any protective effect. On the contrary, plasma from aV vaccinated fish enhanced cytopathic effects, indicating that antibody-dependent entry may play a role in this system. Our results show that poly(I:C) is a promising candidate as an adjuvant for fish vaccination against viral pathogens, and that the zebrafish is a promising model for aquaculture-relevant vaccination studies.",[],"['Arturas Kavaliauskis', 'Marianne Arnemo', 'Sung-Hyun Kim', 'Lilia Ulanova', 'Martin Speth', 'Beatriz Novoa', 'Sonia Dios', 'Øystein Evensen', 'Gareth Wyn Griffiths', 'Tor Gjøen']"
Inactivated vaccine against viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) emulsified with squalene and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant provides long term protection in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) remains an unsolved health problem in Korean aquaculture. Vaccination plays a significant role in modern aquaculture, and the duration of protection provided is of vital importance. Here, we have demonstrated the efficacy, duration of protection and safety of an inactivated vaccine emulsified with squalene (5%) and aluminum hydroxide (0.5%). The inactivated VHS vaccine provided a moderate protection of 37% and 47% relative percent survival (RPS) at 4 and 10 weeks post vaccination (wpv). Addition of squalene and aluminum hydroxide into inactivated VHS vaccine clearly enhanced the level of protection showing 58% and 83% RPS at 4 and 10 wpv, respectively, indicating the need for adjuvants to enhance the efficacy. The vaccinated fish showed significant protection at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 40 wpv (except week 57) than non-vaccinated fish to an intraperitoneal challenge of 10(7.1)TCID₅₀/fish at 15 °C, with RPS of 60%, 64%, 71%, 55%, 52% and 50% (45% at 57 week), respectively, covering the duration of natural outbreak. Fish challenged at 18 wpv at 6 °C showed 56% RPS and protection at a low temperature. The antibody titer was high at 3 wpv with an OD of 1.08 ± 0.13, but decreased gradually and was undetectable by 24 wpv. The vaccine formulation was safe without injection site reactions, adhesions, or pigmentation observed at 6, 12, 18, or 24 wpv. Inflammatory reactions were observed in the spleen intestine at 6 and 12 wpv but were similar as control by 24 wpv.

Transcriptomic responses in rainbow trout gills upon infection with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"It has been previously demonstrated that even though the fin bases constitute the main portal of entry of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), an important number of chemokine genes are up-regulated in the gills upon bath exposure to the virus. Because chemokines mediate the recruitment of leukocytes through the action of specific chemokine receptors, in the current study, we have studied the transcription of several immune genes in response to a VHSV bath infection in the gills, focusing both on chemokine receptor genes and on genes characteristic of distinct leukocyte populations such as IgM, IgD, IgT, CD4, CD8, perforin and MHC-II. We have studied the response to the virus in naïve fish as well as in fish that had been previously intramuscularly (i.m.) injected with a VHSV DNA vaccine. Additionally, we have sorted both IgM(+) and CD8(+) cells from the gills of naïve and infected animals to study some of these up-regulated genes in specific leukocyte populations. Our results indicate that despite the low replication level, VHSV provokes an up-regulation of IgM, IgT, CD3 and perforin transcription together with the up-regulation of CCR7, CCR9, CXCR3B and CXCR4 mRNA levels. Interestingly, MHC-II mRNA was up-regulated and CCR7 was down-modulated in IgM(+) cells from infected gills, whereas perforin, CCR7 and CXCR4 mRNA levels were higher in sorted CD8(+) cells from infected animals. Surprisingly, when fish had been previously injected with either the empty plasmid or the VHSV DNA vaccine, these up-regulations in immune gene transcription were no longer observed. Our results point to the gills as an important site for innate and acquired viral defense.

A Recombinant Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus Genotype IVb Glycoprotein Produced in Cabbage Looper Larvae Trichoplusia ni Elicits Antibody Response and Protection in Muskellunge.,"The Novirhabdovirus viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVb has caused serious fish kills and become endemic throughout the Great Lakes basin of North America. This is troublesome since there are no protective vaccines currently approved against this deadly disease even though recombinant technology has become increasingly common. Herein, we explored the production of a recombinant VHSV-IVb glycoprotein, believed to be important for virus infectivity, and determined its ability to elicit protection against challenge with the wild virus strain. A recombinant baculovirus containing a 5' 6x polyhistidine tag embedded in the VHSV-IVb G gene was used to infect the larvae of the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni. A sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of affinity-purified protein yielded apparent VHSV-IVb glycoprotein at the expected molecular weight of ~65 kDa. The recombinant protein (rG) was used successfully in coating microtiter plate wells in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and positive anti-VHSV-IVb antibodies in Muskellunge Esox masquinongy were capable of binding to both the rG and purified whole VHSV-IVb, indicating epitope resemblance. In addition, the rG elicited a protective response in Muskellunge during a VHSV-IVb immersion challenge, resulting in 80% relative percent survival. Our results demonstrate that cabbage looper larvae can serve as an excellent production system for apparently conformationally correct viral glycoprotein. The incorporation of a polyhistidine tag facilitates obtaining highly purified protein in a relatively high concentration, which has potential in the development of an efficacious subunit vaccine against this deadly virus.

DNA Vaccination Partially Protects Muskellunge against Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV-IVb).,"A DNA vaccine containing the glycoprotein (G) gene of the North American viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVb was developed to evaluate the immune response of fish following vaccination and evaluate its efficacy in protecting a susceptible species, the Muskellunge Esox masquinongy, against VHSV-IVb challenge. Seven weeks (539 degree-days) following vaccination with 10 μg of either pVHSivb-G or a control plasmid, Muskellunge were challenged by immersion with 10<sup>5</sup> plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL of VHSV-IVb. Fish vaccinated with pVHSivb-G had a relative percent survival (RPS) of 45%.

"Enhancement of glycoprotein-based DNA vaccine for viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) via addition of the molecular adjuvant, DDX41.","The use of molecular adjuvants to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines has been thoroughly studied in recent years. Glycoprotein (G)-based DNA vaccines had been proven to be effective in combating infection against Rhabdovirus (especially infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, IHNV) in salmonids. DDX41 is a helicase known to induce antiviral and inflammatory responses by inducing a type I IFN innate immune response. To gain more information regarding G-based DNA vaccines in olive flounder (Paralicthys olivaceus), we tried to develop a more efficient G-based DNA vaccine by adding a molecular adjuvant, DDX41. We designed a DNA vaccine in which the VHSV glycoprotein (G-protein) and DDX41 were driven by the EF-1α and CMV promoters, respectively. Olive flounders were intramuscularly immunized with 1 μg of plasmids encoding the G-based DNA vaccine alone (pEF-G), the molecular adjuvant alone (pEF-D), or the vaccine-adjuvant construct (pEF-GD). At two different time points, 15 and 30 days later, the fish were intraperitoneally infected with VHSV (100 μL; 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL). Our assays revealed that the plasmid constructs showed up-regulated expression of IFN-1 and its associated genes at day 3 post-vaccination in both kidney and spleen samples. Specifically, pEF-GD showed statistically higher expression of immune response genes than pEF-G and pEF-D treated group (p < 0.05/p < 0.001). After VHSV challenge, the fish group treated with pEF-GD showed higher survival rate than the pEF-G treated group, though difference was not statistically significant in the 15 dpv challenged group however in the 30 dpv challenged group, the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Together, these results clearly demonstrate that DDX41 is an effective adjuvant for the G-based DNA vaccine in olive flounder. Our novel findings could facilitate the development of more effective DNA vaccines for the aquaculture industry.","['DDX41', 'Glycoprotein', 'Innate immune system', 'Interferon', 'VHSV']","['Jassy Mary S Lazarte', 'Young Rim Kim', 'Jung Seok Lee', 'Se Pyeong Im', 'Si Won Kim', 'Jae Wook Jung', 'Jaesung Kim', 'Woo Jai Lee', 'Tae Sung Jung']"
The Socioeconomic Impacts of Clinically Diagnosed Haemorrhagic Septicaemia on Smallholder Large Ruminant Farmers in Cambodia.,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is an acute fatal infectious disease of mainly cattle and buffalo and outbreaks occur commonly in Cambodia.

The Village Animal Health Worker (VAHW) or Chief in each village and 66 affected smallholders were surveyed. At the village level, 24% of all households were affected with an estimated mean village herd morbidity of 10.1% and mortality of 28.8%. Affected farmers reported HS disease morbidity and mortality at 42.7% and 63.6% respectively. Buffalo had a higher morbidity (OR = 2.3; P = 0.003) and mortality (OR = 6.9; P < 0.001) compared with cattle, and unvaccinated large ruminants a higher morbidity (OR = 2.9; P = 0.001). The financial impact varied depending on whether the animal survived, provision of treatment, draught replacement and lost secondary income. The mean cost per affected household was USD 952.50 based on ownership of five large ruminants. The impact per affected animal was USD 375.00, reducing the pre-disease value by 66.1%. A partial budget revealed an overwhelming incentive for farmers to practice biannual vaccination, with a net benefit of USD 951.58 per household based on an annual disease incidence rate of 1. Sensitivity analysis showed that a net benefit of USD 32.42 remained based on an outbreak every 20 years. This study indicates HS can cause a catastrophic financial shock to smallholders and remains a critical constraint to improving large ruminant productivity and profitability. Addressing HS disease control requires a focus on improving smallholder farmer knowledge of biosecurity and vaccination and should be priority to stakeholders interested in addressing regional food insecurity and poverty reduction.","['biosecurity', 'buffalo', 'cattle', 'livelihood', 'mekong', 'transboundary animal diseases']","['M Kawasaki', 'J R Young', 'S Suon', 'R D Bush', 'P A Windsor']"
Viral tropism and pathology associated with viral hemorrhagic septicemia in larval and juvenile Pacific herring.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVa causes mass mortality in wild Pacific herring, a species of economic value, in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Young of the year herring are particularly susceptible and can be carriers of the virus. To understand its pathogenesis, tissue and cellular tropisms of VHSV in larval and juvenile Pacific herring were investigated with immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, and viral tissue titer. In larval herring, early viral tropism for epithelial tissues (6d post-exposure) was indicated by foci of epidermal thickening that contained heavy concentrations of virus. This was followed by a cellular tropism for fibroblasts within the fin bases and the dermis, but expanded to cells of the kidney, liver, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract and meninges in the brain. Among wild juvenile herring that underwent a VHS epizootic in the laboratory, the disease was characterized by acute and chronic phases of death. Fish that died during the acute phase had systemic infections in tissues including the submucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, spleen, kidney, liver, and meninges. The disease then transitioned into a chronic phase that was characterized by the appearance of neurological signs including erratic and corkscrew swimming and darkening of the dorsal skin. During the chronic phase viral persistence occurred in nervous tissues including meninges and brain parenchymal cells and in one case in peripheral nerves, while virus was mostly cleared from the other tissues. The results demonstrate the varying VHSV tropisms dependent on the timing of infection and the importance of neural tissues for the persistence and perpetuation of chronic infections in Pacific herring.",[],"['J Lovy', 'N L Lewis', 'P K Hershberger', 'W Bennett', 'T R Meyers', 'K A Garver']"
"Development of a Liquid Chip Technique to Simultaneously Detect Spring Viremia of Carp Virus, Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus, and Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia of Salmonids.","A liquid chip technique was developed to detect spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) of salmonids simultaneously. Sequences of the G gene of SVCV, N gene of IHNV, and G gene of VHSV were used to design SVCV-, IHNV-, and VHSV-specific primers, which were labeled with biotin and subjected to amination modification. They were then coupled with fluorescence-coded microspheres and used for hybridization with reverse-transcription PCR products of SVCV, IHNV, and VHSV. A BD FACSArray was used to detect fluorescence signal in the reaction system. This assay system had a high sensitivity to SVCV, VHSV, and IHNV, with LODs of 10, 10, and 100 pg/μL, respectively. Moreover, the assay was specific for the detection of SVCV, IHNV, and VHSV and was not susceptible to cross-detection of other viruses, including pike fry rhabdovirus, hirame rhabdovirus, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, viral nervous necrosis virus, yellowtail ascites virus, grass carp reovirus, red sea bream iridovirus, and koi herpesvirus. The liquid chip assay technique established in this study provides a novel, convenient, and rapid approach for the detection of SVCV, IHNV, and VHSV.",[],"['Guixiang Tong', 'Xinxian Wei', 'Weili Yin', 'Xiaoguang Liao', 'Kai Yang', 'Zhishan Fang', 'Tao Sun', 'Zhiqin Yue', 'Xiaozheng Li']"
Differences of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus loads among organs of the dead and surviving olive flounder by intramuscular injection and immersion challenge.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is an important viral pathogen in olive flounder culture. Based on cumulative mortality, the virulence of VHSV was found to be highly different depending on challenge routes and exposure doses. The olive flounder was injected with VHSV at 10<sup>2.5</sup> , 10<sup>4.5</sup> , 10<sup>6.5</sup> and 10<sup>8.5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> /100 μL/fish. A second group of fish was immersed at 10<sup>3.5</sup> , 10<sup>5.5</sup> and 10<sup>7.5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> /mL at 10 °C for 1h in this study. The cumulative mortality was observed at 15 dpi. Immersion challenge at 10<sup>3.5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> /mL caused no mortality, while intramuscular (IM) injection challenge resulted in high levels of mortality with all VHSV exposure doses. Overall, olive flounder was susceptible to VHSV, with cumulative mortality of 90% or 100% in fish IM injected with high or low doses of VHSV. The cumulative mortality was 40 and 70% at 10<sup>5.5</sup> and 10<sup>7.5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> /mL in immersion challenge group, respectively. The VHSV titration and copy numbers were estimated by TCID<sub>50</sub> and qRT-PCR methods. From dead flounder, VHSV titration was consistently detected in all tested organs ranged from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> /mL. VHSV titration was under the detection limit, but VHSV N-gene was detected from the surviving flounder. This article is protected by copyright.

"The glycoprotein, non-virion protein, and polymerase of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus are not determinants of host-specific virulence in rainbow trout.","Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), a fish rhabdovirus belonging to the Novirhabdovirus genus, causes severe disease and mortality in many marine and freshwater fish species worldwide. VHSV isolates are classified into four genotypes and each group is endemic to specific geographic regions in the north Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Most viruses in the European VHSV genotype Ia are highly virulent for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), whereas, VHSV genotype IVb viruses from the Great Lakes region in the United States, which caused high mortality in wild freshwater fish species, are avirulent for trout. This study describes molecular characterization and construction of an infectious clone of the virulent VHSV-Ia strain DK-3592B from Denmark, and application of the clone in reverse genetics to investigate the role of selected VHSV protein(s) in host-specific virulence in rainbow trout (referred to as trout-virulence).Overlapping cDNA fragments of the DK-3592B genome were cloned after RT-PCR amplification, and their DNA sequenced by the di-deoxy chain termination method. A full-length cDNA copy (pVHSVdk) of the DK-3592B strain genome was constructed by assembling six overlapping cDNA fragments by using natural or artificially created unique restriction sites in the overlapping regions of the clones. Using an existing clone of the trout-avirulent VHSV-IVb strain MI03 (pVHSVmi), eight chimeric VHSV clones were constructed in which the coding region(s) of the glycoprotein (G), non-virion protein (NV), G and NV, or G, NV and L (polymerase) genes together, were exchanged between the two clones. Ten recombinant VHSVs (rVHSVs) were generated, including two parental rVHSVs, by transfecting fish cells with ten individual full-length plasmid constructs along with supporting plasmids using the established protocol. Recovered rVHSVs were characterized for viability and growth in vitro and used to challenge groups of juvenile rainbow trout by intraperitoneal injection.Complete sequence of the VHSV DK-3592B genome was determined from the cloned cDNA and deposited in GenBank under the accession no. KC778774. The trout-virulent DK-3592B genome (genotype Ia) is 11,159 nt in length and differs from the trout-avirulent MI03 genome (pVHSVmi) by 13% at the nucleotide level. When the rVHSVs were assessed for the trout-virulence phenotype in vivo, the parental rVHSVdk and rVHSVmi were virulent and avirulent, respectively, as expected. Four chimeric rVHSVdk viruses with the substitutions of the G, NV, G and NV, or G, NV and L genes from the avirulent pVHSVmi constructs were still highly virulent (100% mortality), while the reciprocal four chimeric rVHSVmi viruses with genes from pVHSVdk remained avirulent (0-10% mortality).When chimeric rVHSVs, containing all the G, NV, and L gene substitutions, were tested in vivo, they did not exhibit any change in trout-virulence relative to the background clones. These results demonstrate that the G, NV and L genes of VHSV are not, by themselves or in combination, major determinants of host-specific virulence in trout.","['Fish', 'Glycoprotein', 'Non-virion protein', 'Polymerase protein', 'Rhabdovirus', 'VHSV', 'Virulence determinant']","['Shamila Yusuff', 'Gael Kurath', 'Min Sun Kim', 'Tarin M Tesfaye', 'Jie Li', 'Douglas G McKenney', 'Vikram N Vakharia']"
Safety and protective efficacy of intramuscular vaccination with a live aroA derivative of Pasteurella multocida B:2 against experimental hemorrhagic septicemia in calves.,"Three groups of five calves, namely, V1, V2, and V3, were immunized intramuscularly at 4 and 8 weeks of age with ca. 10(9), 10(8), and 10(7) CFU, respectively, of a derivative of Pasteurella multocida B:2 wild-type strain 85020 containing a deletion in the aroA gene (strain JRMT12). The first and second vaccinations resulted in significantly (P < 0.01) higher rectal temperature responses in groups V1 and V2 than in group V3. Serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG titers did not increase in any group until after the second vaccination and were then significantly higher in groups V1 and V2 than in group V3 (P = 0.001 for both IgM and IgG). All vaccinated groups and three unvaccinated challenge control calves (group CC) were injected subcutaneously at 10 weeks of age with ca. 10(7) CFU of strain 85020. Vaccinated calves survived the challenge, but two CC animals developed clinical disease and were killed for humane reasons. After challenge, mean serum amyloid A concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the CC group than in the vaccinated groups. Postmortem examination revealed that calves in the CC group showed the most extensive range of bacteriologically positive tissues and gross and histopathological lesions. Overall, a clear dose-dependent response was present, with those receiving a higher vaccine dose being less affected clinically, bacteriologically, and pathologically by the wild-type challenge.

Detection and surveillance of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus using real-time RT-PCR. II. Diagnostic evaluation of two protocols.,"Two real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays under consideration for deployment to multiple testing laboratories across the USA were evaluated for diagnostic sensitivity and specificity on tissue homogenates obtained from natural and experimental viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS)-infected fish. Estimates for diagnostic specificity using virus isolation as the reference method were similar between laboratories regardless of the assay. Diagnostic sensitivity estimates of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.97) for Jonstrup et al. (2013)'s assay (J Fish Dis 36:9-23) exceeded the diagnostic sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.87) for Phelps et al. (2012)'s assay (J Aquat Anim Health 24:238-243). The Jonstrup rRT-PCR assay is robust as demonstrated by high sensitivity and specificity estimates across laboratories and can be used as a valuable tool for targeted surveillance and for testing of suspect VHSV samples.

"Serotyping of foot and mouth disease virus and Pasteurella multocida from Indian gaurs (Bos gaurus), concurrently infected with foot and mouth disease and haemorrhagic septicaemia.","We report the serotyping of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and Pasteurella multocida from Indian gaurs which were concurrently infected with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and haemorrhagic septicaemia. Bannerghatta biological park (BBP), a national park located in the outskirts of Bengaluru city, Karnataka, India, is bordered by several villages. These villages witnessed massive outbreaks of FMD which spread rapidly to the herbivores at BBP. Post-mortem was conducted on carcasses of two Indian gaurs that died with symptoms of FMD. The salient gross findings included extensive vesicular lesions on the tongue, gums, cheeks, upper palate and hooves. Haemorrhagic tracheitis and ecchymotic haemorrhages on the heart were characteristic. The vesicular lesions of oral cavity were positive for 'O' type of FMD virus by sandwich enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). The heart blood and spleen samples yielded growth of pure cultures of P. multocida. The isolates were typed as P. multocida type B using KTSP61 and KTT72 primers yielding specific amplicons of 620 bp. The phylogenetic analysis of the isolates was carried by sequencing of 1.4-Kbp nucleotides on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of the isolates.

Detection of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus-IVb antibodies in sera of muskellunge Esox masquinongy using competitive ELISA.,"A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) was developed for the detection of antibodies to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus genotype IVb (VHSV-IVb) in fish sera. Assay conditions were standardized using known negative and positive muskellunge Esox masquinongy. A positive-negative threshold of 14.6% inhibition was established based on analysis of sera of 60 muskellunge with no previous exposure to VHSV-IVb. The cELISA was then used to investigate immune responses of wild muskellunge sampled from 5 water bodies in Michigan and Wisconsin, USA, between 2005 and 2012. Antibodies were detected in fish from Lake St. Clair, Michigan, and Lower Fox River/Green Bay, Wisconsin. Both water systems were considered enzootic for VHSV-IVb. Additionally, antibodies were detected in muskellunge from Thornapple Lake, a Michigan inland lake previously considered negative for VHSV-IVb based on virus isolation methods. Muskellunge populations from Lake Hudson, Michigan, and Butternut Lake, Wisconsin, lacked evidence of an immune response to VHSV-IVb. When results of the cELISA were compared to the 50% plaque neutralization test for several groups of fish, there was 78.4% agreement between the tests for antibody presence. The cELISA is a rapid and efficient test for the detection of binding antibodies to VHSV-IVb and will be a useful non-lethal tool for monitoring the spread of this serious pathogen.

Effect of truncation of the N-terminal region of the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) P protein on viral replication.,"The phosphoprotein (P) of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) plays an essential role in viral replication by interconnecting the L protein and the N protein-RNA complex. In this study, to investigate the role of the N-terminal region of the P protein in viral replication, we mutated the first or the first and second or the first, second, and third ATG codon into TGA stop codons. The respective mutants were named P1, P2, and P3. Recombinant VHSVs containing each mutated P gene (rVHSV-P1, -P2, and -P3) were successfully generated by supplying the intact P protein in trans. The rVHSV-P2 and -P3 were not generated from cells expressing truncated P proteins (P1, P2 or P3 protein), but the rVHSV-P1 produced infectious viruses, even in cells without any P-protein-expressing plasmids. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the P gene of rVHSV-P1 showed that a mutation had occurred that resulted in the fourth amino acid (isoleucine, ATT) being changed to methionine (ATG) without a frameshift (P0.5), suggesting that strong selection pressure might facilitate mutations that are advantageous or essential for virus replication. Infectious rVHSV-P2 and -P3 were produced in cells expressing the P0.5 protein, suggesting that the first three amino acids of the P protein of VHSV are dispensable for viral replication. Furthermore, although the P1 protein was shorter than the P0.5 protein by only two amino acid residues, no viruses were produced when the P1 protein was supplied indicating that the fourth and the fifth amino acid residues are indispensable for normal P protein functions involved in viral replication.

Accurate detection and quantification of the fish viral hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSv) with a two-color fluorometric real-time PCR assay.,"Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSv) is one of the world's most serious fish pathogens, infecting >80 marine, freshwater, and estuarine fish species from Eurasia and North America. A novel and especially virulent strain - IVb - appeared in the Great Lakes in 2003, has killed many game fish species in a series of outbreaks in subsequent years, and shut down interstate transport of baitfish. Cell culture is the diagnostic method approved by the USDA-APHIS, which takes a month or longer, lacks sensitivity, and does not quantify the amount of virus. We thus present a novel, easy, rapid, and highly sensitive real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay that incorporates synthetic competitive template internal standards for quality control to circumvent false negative results. Results demonstrate high signal-to-analyte response (slope = 1.00±0.02) and a linear dynamic range that spans seven orders of magnitude (R(2) = 0.99), ranging from 6 to 6,000,000 molecules. Infected fishes are found to harbor levels of virus that range to 1,200,000 VHSv molecules/10(6) actb1 molecules with 1,000 being a rough cut-off for clinical signs of disease. This new assay is rapid, inexpensive, and has significantly greater accuracy than other published qRT-PCR tests and traditional cell culture diagnostics.

Generation of G gene-deleted viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and evaluation of its vaccine potential in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"Generation of recombinant viruses lacking an essential gene for the production of infective viral particles would be a way to produce safety-enhanced live viral vaccines. The rhabdoviral envelope-spiked glycoprotein (G) plays critical roles in the attachment of viruses on the cell surface receptor and in the transfer of endocytosed viruses to the cytoplasm by fusion to the endosomal membrane. In the present study, we produced a G gene-lacking recombinant viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (rVHSV-ΔG) that has no ability to form plaques in the cells without a trans-supply of the G protein, which suggests that rVHSV-ΔG is a single cycle virus and progenies of rVHSV-ΔG are not infectious. One of the major advantages of attenuated vaccines is the maintenance of replication ability in the host, which enforces the adaptive immune responses. However, in spite of lacking an ability to produce infective viral particles, immunization with the present rVHSV-ΔG induced significantly higher serum neutralization titers and survival rates against virulent VHSV challenge in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) fingerlings, indicating that the present rVHSV-ΔG has a high potential as a prophylactic vaccine.","['G gene deleted recombinant VHSV (rVHSV-ΔG)', 'Olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)', 'Replication-incompetent', 'Vaccine potential']","['Min Sun Kim', 'Ji Sun Park', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
Comparative Genomic Analysis of Asian Haemorrhagic Septicaemia-Associated Strains of Pasteurella multocida Identifies More than 90 Haemorrhagic Septicaemia-Specific Genes.,"Pasteurella multocida is the primary causative agent of a range of economically important diseases in animals, including haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), a rapidly fatal disease of ungulates. There is limited information available on the diversity of P. multocida strains that cause HS. Therefore, we determined draft genome sequences of ten disease-causing isolates and two vaccine strains and compared these genomes using a range of bioinformatic analyses. The draft genomes of the 12 HS strains were between 2,298,035 and 2,410,300 bp in length. Comparison of these genomes with the North American HS strain, M1404, and other available P. multocida genomes (Pm70, 3480, 36950 and HN06) identified a core set of 1,824 genes. A set of 96 genes was present in all HS isolates and vaccine strains examined in this study, but absent from Pm70, 3480, 36950 and HN06. Moreover, 59 genes were shared only by the Asian B:2 strains. In two Pakistani isolates, genes with high similarity to genes in the integrative and conjugative element, ICEPmu1 from strain 36950 were identified along with a range of other antimicrobial resistance genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HS strains formed clades based on their country of isolation. Future analysis of the 96 genes unique to the HS isolates will aid the identification of HS-specific virulence attributes and facilitate the development of disease-specific diagnostic tests.

Evaluation of immuno efficiency of hemorrhagic septicemia vaccine strain (vaccine seed).,"To compared seed culture of hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) bacteria which was used to produce vaccine for its antibody induction efficiency before and after passaging in natural host (calf) using laboratory animals.Serial dilution of virulent bacteria was injected in to mice which were immunized with HS vaccine which was obtained from seed bacteria before and after back passaged in calf. Ratio of survived and dead was calculated by Reed-Meunch hypothesis and the LD50 value for each vaccine trial groups were calculated.The immunological study revealed that vaccine prepared from back passaged seed culture showed greater improvement in its immunopotency than seed vaccine (before back passage). Around 200 mice were used to study the immuno efficiency of vaccine. Each mouse was from the same source, which were free from the Pastuerella infection previous to expose to trial infection. The same broth culture of HS was used to induce infection in mice in both trials (vaccine before back passage and vaccine after back passage). The 0.2 mL of broth dilution from 10(-1) to 10(-10) was used, as dilution increases, death rate decreases. It indicates the minimum load of bacterium is required to induced infection.Obtained results revealed that back passaged vaccine seed HS bacteria in its natural host had provided better immune efficiency to the culture than laboratory stock culture, and this findings recommended that regular annual back passage was mandatory for the vaccine seed culture of Pastuerella multocida bacteria for better establishment of immune potent vaccines.","['Annual vaccination', 'Hemorrhagic septicemia', 'LD50 values', 'Laboratory animals', 'Natural host']","['Maheswarappa Gowrakkal', 'M Chandrashekar', 'Shankarappa Bhajantri', 'Jaykumar Satav', 'Gc Chandakala', 'Asha Mayanna', 'Sm Byregowda', 'C Renukaprasad']"

Development of a stringent ELISA protocol to evaluate anti-viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus-specific antibodies in olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus with improved specificity.,"Olive flounder were vaccinated with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] to prevent viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). Vaccine efficacy was verified by detection of anti- VHS virus (VHSV) antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the study, ELISA absorbance values of the negative control group [Poly (I:C)-MEM10] were saturated when an ELISA protocol, that includes pretreatment of the fish sera with 5% skim milk, was used. However, the saturated OD values in the negative control did not correlate with a specific immune response against VHSV, because the group showed low survival rate (only 10%) following the VHSV challenge. Also, OD values of Poly (I:C)- VHSV group were high, and the group showed high survival rate (97.5%) against VHSV challenge test. It was suggested that the high OD values were possibly due to the presence of anti-fetal bovine serum (FBS) cross-reactivity. To compensate this, we subtracted the absorbance of infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHNV)-Ag plates from those of the VHSV-Ag plates. However, the average value for the Poly (I:C)-VHSV group (0.167) was lower than expected even though high survival rate. We used an advanced ELISA system to pre-treat fish sera with 5% skim milk and two novirhabdoviruses as capture antigens as well as 50% FBS. The corrected absorbance values for pre-treated fish sera from the negative control Poly (I:C)-MEM10 and experimental Poly (I:C)-VHSV groups averaged 0.033 and 0.579, respectively. The specific VHSV antibody response of the vaccinated group was assessed using fish sera pretreated with skim milk and FBS and by calculating the corrected absorbance values from ELISA with two novirhabdovirus capture antigens.

Generation of a recombinant viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) expressing olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) interferon-γ and its effects on type I interferon response and virulence.,"Rhabdoviruses including viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) are highly susceptible to type I interferon (IFN) responses, and IFN-γ that is belonging to the type II IFN has been known to enhance type I IFN responses in mammals. In this study, we generated a recombinant VHSV that can express olive flounder IFN-γ (rVHSV-A-IFNγ) using reverse genetics technology, and analyzed the effect of rVHSV-A-IFNγ infection on type I IFN response in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. Furthermore, the virulence of rVHSV-A-IFNγ was evaluated by infection to olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Using a recombinant VHSV full genome vector in which the olive flounder IFN-γ ORF was inserted between N and P genes, rVHSV-A-IFNγ was successfully rescued, and the recombinant virus was grown well in EPC cells. On the other hand, the growth of rVHSV-A-IFNγ rescued from EPC cells was severely retarded when infected into hirame natural embryo (HINAE) cells that were originated from olive flounder. These results indicate that the EPC cell's IFN-γ receptor could not bind to olive flounder IFN-γ, but the species-specific binding of IFN-γ in HINAE cells induced antiviral responses. The expression of Mx1 gene in EPC cells infected with rVHSV-A-IFNγ was not greatly different from cells infected with rVHSV-Arfp (a recombinant VHSV harboring red fluorescent protein gene between N and P genes of the genome), however, in HINAE cells, rVHSV-A-IFNγ infection induced distinctively higher Mx1 gene expression compared to other recombinant viruses. These results suggest that olive flounder IFN-γ produced from rVHSV-A-IFNγ effectively enhanced type I IFN response in HINAE cells. In the present study, the lowest mortality of olive flounder fingerlings was recorded in the group of fish challenged with rVHSV-A-IFNγ, suggesting that the recombinant VHSV was attenuated by production of IFN-γ by itself. However, although rVHSV-A-IFNγ induced significantly lower mortality, the mortality still reached to 40%. Therefore, to be safely used in the aquaculture farms as prophylactic vaccines or immunostmulators, further manipulations that can guarantee safety are needed.","['IFN-γ', 'Olive flounder', 'Recombinant VHSV', 'Type I IFN', 'Virulence']","['Jun Soung Kwak', 'Min Sun Kim', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
Generation of Recombinant Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (rVHSV) Expressing Two Foreign Proteins and Effect of Lengthened Viral Genome on Viral Growth and In Vivo Virulence.,"In this study, a new recombinant VHSV (rVHSV-Arfp-Bgfp) was generated by insertion of a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene between N and P genes, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene between P and M genes of VHSV genome, the expression of each heterologous gene in infected cells, and effects of the lengthened recombinant VHSV's genome on the replication ability and in vivo virulence to olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) fingerlings were compared with previously generated rVHSVs (rVHSV-wild, rVHSV-Arfp, and rVHSV-Brfp). The expression of RFP and GFP in cells infected with rVHSV-Arfp-Bgfp was verified through fluorescent microscopy and FACS analysis. In the viral growth analysis, rVHSV-Arfp and rVHSV-Brfp showed significantly lower viral titers than rVHSV-wild, and the replication of rVHSV-Arfp-Bgfp was significantly decreased compared to that of even rVHSV-Arfp or rVHSV-Brfp. These results suggest that the genome length is a critical factor for the determination of rVHSVs replication efficiency. In the in vivo virulence experiment, the cumulative mortalities of olive flounder fingerlings infected with each rVHSV were inversely proportional to the length of the viral genome, suggesting that decreased viral growth rate due to the lengthened viral genome is accompanied with the decrease of in vivo virulence of rVHSVs. Recombinant viruses expressing multiple foreign antigens can be used for the development of combined vaccines. However, as the present rVHSV-Arfp-Bgfp still possesses an ability to kill hosts (although very weakened), researches on the producing more attenuated viruses or propagation-deficient replicon particles are needed to solve safety-related problems.","['In vivo virulence', 'Lengthened genome', 'Reverse genetics', 'Two foreign proteins', 'Viral growth', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Min Sun Kim', 'Su Jin Lee', 'Dong Soo Kim', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
Species specific inhibition of viral replication using dicer substrate siRNAs (DsiRNAs) targeting the viral nucleoprotein of the fish pathogenic rhabdovirus viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"Gene knock down by the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is widely used as a method for reducing the expression of specific genes in eukaryotic cells via the RNA interference pathway. But, the effectivity of siRNA induced gene knock down in cells from fish has in several studies been questioned and the specificity seems to be a general problem in cells originating from both lower and higher vertebrates. Here we show that we are able to reduce the level of viral gene expression and replication specifically in fish cells in vitro. We do so by using 27/25-mer DsiRNAs acting as substrates for dicer for the generation of siRNAs targeting the nucleoprotein N gene of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). This rhabdovirus infects salmonid fish and is responsible for large yearly losses in aquaculture production. Specificity of the DsiRNA is assured in two ways: first, by using the conventional method of testing a control DsiRNA which should not target the gene of interest. Second, by assuring that replication of a heterologous virus of the same genus as the target virus was not inhibited by the DsiRNA. Target controls are, as we have previously highlighted, essential for verification of the specificity of siRNA-induced interference with virus multiplication, but they are still not in general use.",[],"['Harry Bohle', 'Niels Lorenzen', 'Brian Dall Schyth']"
A single amino acid change in the non-structural NV protein impacts the virulence phenotype of Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in trout.,"Novirhabdoviruses like the Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) are rhabdoviruses infecting fish. In the current study, RNA genomes of different VHSV field isolates classified as high, medium or low virulent phenotypes have been sequenced by next-generation sequencing and compared. Various amino acid changes, depending on the VHSV phenotype, have been identified in all the VHSV proteins. As a starting point, we focused our study on the non-virion (NV) non-structural protein in which an arginine residue (R116) is present in all the virulent isolates and replaced by a serine/asparagine residue S/N116 in the attenuated isolates. A recombinant virus derived from a virulent VHSV strain in which the NV R116 residue has been replaced by a serine, rVHSVNVR116S, was generated by reverse genetics and used to infect juvenile trout. We showed that rVHSVNVR116S was highly attenuated and that surviving fish were almost completely protected from a challenge with the wild-type VHSV.",[],"['Laury Baillon', 'Emilie Mérour', 'Joëlle Cabon', 'Lénaïg Louboutin', 'Hélène Quenault', 'Fabrice Touzain', 'Thierry Morin', 'Yannick Blanchard', 'Stéphane Biacchesi', 'Michel Brémont']"
Dexamethasone treatment decreases replication of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells.,"The expression of Mx1 in EPC cells after treatment with poly(I:C) or infection with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was significantly suppressed by treatment with dexamethasone. However, the titer of VHSV did not increase but instead decreased after dexamethasone treatment. This suggests that dexamethasone not only downregulates type I IFN but also affects certain factors that are necessary for VHSV replication. An important effect of HSP90 on replication of RNA viruses and downregulation of HSP90 by glucocorticoids have been reported. In this study, dexamethasone downregulated HSP90α expression in EPC cells that were stimulated with poly(I:C) or infected with VHSV. Furthermore, cells treated with an HSP90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, showed significantly decreased titers of VHSV, suggesting that HSP90 may be an important host component involved in VHSV replication, and HSP90 inhibition might be one of the causes for the observed reduction in viral titer caused by dexamethasone treatment.","['Dexamethasone', 'HSP90', 'Replication', 'Type I IFN', 'VHSV']","['Min Sun Kim', 'Su Jin Lee', 'Seung Hyuk Choi', 'Yue Jai Kang', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
Restricted replication of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in a birnavirus-carrier cell culture.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) are economically important pathogens of the salmonid aquaculture industry. In previous work we demonstrated that a cell line persistently infected with IPNV (EPC<sup>IPNV</sup>) exhibited antiviral activity against superinfection with the heterologous virus VHSV. This work extends our study by analyzing the replication of VHSV in the IPNV-persistently infected cells. At early and late stages of infection VHSV RNA synthesis, as well as VHSV-induced syncytia formation, were examined in EPC<sup>IPNV</sup> cultures. During the course of VHSV infection the accumulation of VHSV RNA is inhibited in EPC<sup>IPNV</sup> cells. Typical VHSV-induced membrane fusion at the late stages of infection is also absent in the IPNV carrier cultures. VHSV binding and fusion to EPC<sup>IPNV</sup> cells did not appear to be impaired, but a potent inhibitory effect on VHSV RNA synthesis is exerted at early times of infection in the IPNV carrier culture. In conclusion, the EPC<sup>IPNV</sup> cells are considered to be a useful system to study viral interference as well to analyze the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of superinfection exclusion.","['EPC line', 'IPNV', 'Persistent infection', 'VHSV', 'Viral interference']","['Ricardo Parreño', 'Lucía Almagro', 'Melissa Belló-Pérez', 'Regla M Medina-Gali', 'Amparo Estepa', 'Luis Perez']"
OmpA protein sequence-based typing and virulence-associated gene profiles of Pasteurella multocida isolates associated with bovine haemorrhagic septicaemia and porcine pneumonic pasteurellosis in Thailand.,"Pasteurella multocida is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes economically significant infections of a broad range of animal species. Pneumonic and septicaemic pasteurellosis caused by this bacterium remain important problems in pigs, cattle, and water buffaloes in Thailand. The aim of this study was to characterise the virulence-associated gene profiles and to develop an OmpA molecular typing scheme for classifying 191 bovine and porcine isolates of P. multocida collected between 1989 and 2012 in Thailand using polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), nucleotide sequencing, and sequence and structural bioinformatics analyses.PCR screening successfully characterised the profiles of 25 virulence-associated genes in all isolates. The gene profiles separated these isolates into bovine and porcine clusters based on eight genes (hgbB, hsf1, tadD, nanH, pfhA, plpE, pmHAS, and tbpA). Phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide and protein sequences corresponding to the ompA gene, which encodes a major outer membrane surface protein, showed two major bovine and porcine clusters. Structural prediction and analysis of the dN/dS ratio revealed four hypervariable extracellular loops of the OmpA transmembrane domains. These four loops were used to develop an OmpA typing scheme. This scheme classified 186 isolates into five major loop sequence types (LST8, LST12, LST15, LST18, and LST19), consistent with the phylogenetic results. The loop regions of the bovine isolates were predicted to be more antigenic than those of the porcine isolates. Thus, molecular evolution of the OmpA proteins could be used to classify P. multocida isolates into different capsular types, host types, and, possibly, pathogenicity levels.Together with the virulence-associated gene profiles, the typing reported in this work provides a better understanding of P. multocida virulence. Effective monitoring and potential strain-specific subunit vaccines could be developed based on these loop oligopeptides.","['Haemorrhagic septicaemia', 'Molecular evolution', 'Molecular typing', 'Pasteurella multocida', 'Pneumonic pasteurellosis', 'Virulence-associated genes', 'ompA']","['Teerasak E-Kobon', 'Ratiporn Leeanan', 'Saengtian Pannoi', 'Pornchai Anuntasomboon', 'Pacharee Thongkamkoon', 'Arinthip Thamchaipenet']"
RNA aptamers inhibit the growth of the fish pathogen viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a serious disease impacting wild and cultured fish worldwide. Hence, an effective therapeutic method against VHSV infection needs to be developed. Aptamer technology is a new and promising method for diagnostics and therapeutics. It revolves around the use of an aptamer molecule, an artificial ligand (nucleic acid or protein), which has the capacity to recognize target molecules with high affinity and specificity. Here, we aimed at selecting RNA aptamers that can specifically bind to and inhibit the growth of a strain of fish VHSV both in vitro and in vivo. Three VHSV-specific RNA aptamers (F1, F2, and C6) were selected from a pool of artificially and randomly produced oligonucleotides using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. The three RNA aptamers showed obvious binding to VHSV in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay but not to other tested viruses. The RNA aptamers were tested for their ability to inhibit VHSV in vitro using hirame natural embryo (HINAE) cells. Cytopathic effect and plaque assays showed that all aptamers inhibited the growth of VHSV in HINAE cells. In vivo tests using RNA aptamers produced by Rhodovulum sulfidophilum showed that extracellular RNA aptamers inhibited VHSV infection in Japanese flounder. These results suggest that the RNA aptamers are a useful tool for protection against VHSV infection in Japanese flounder.",[],"['Porntep Punnarak', 'Mudjekeewis D Santos', 'Seong Don Hwang', 'Hidehiro Kondo', 'Ikuo Hirono', 'Yo Kikuchi', 'Takashi Aoki']"
Experimental infection studies demonstrating Atlantic salmon as a host and reservoir of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus type IVa with insights into pathology and host immunity.,"In British Columbia, Canada (BC), aquaculture of finfish in ocean netpens has the potential for pathogen transmission between wild and farmed species due to the sharing of an aquatic environment. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is enzootic in BC and causes serious disease in wild Pacific herring, Clupea pallasii, which often enter and remain in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, netpens. Isolation of VHSV from farmed Atlantic salmon has been previously documented, but the effects on the health of farmed salmon and the wild fish sharing the environment are unknown. To determine their susceptibility, Atlantic salmon were exposed to a pool of 9 isolates of VHSV obtained from farmed Atlantic salmon in BC by IP-injection or by waterborne exposure and cohabitation with diseased Pacific herring. Disease intensity was quantified by recording mortality, clinical signs, histopathological changes, cellular sites of viral replication, expression of interferon-related genes, and viral tissue titers. Disease ensued in Atlantic salmon after both VHSV exposure methods. Fish demonstrated gross disease signs including darkening of the dorsal skin, bilateral exophthalmia, light cutaneous hemorrhage, and lethargy. The virus replicated within endothelial cells causing endothelial cell necrosis and extensive hemorrhage in anterior kidney. Infected fish demonstrated a type I interferon response as seen by up-regulation of genes for IFNα, Mx, and ISG15. In a separate trial infected salmon transmitted the virus to sympatric Pacific herring. The results demonstrate that farmed Atlantic salmon can develop clinical VHS and virus can persist in the tissues for at least 10 weeks. Avoiding VHS epizootics in Atlantic salmon farms would limit the potential of VHS in farmed Atlantic salmon, the possibility for further host adaptation in this species, and virus spillback to sympatric wild fishes.","['Atlantic salmon', 'Immune gene', 'Pathology', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia']","['J Lovy', 'P Piesik', 'P K Hershberger', 'K A Garver']"
Effect of CXCL12-expressing viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus replicon particles on leukocytes migration and vaccine efficacy in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"Viral replicon particles are single-cycle viruses defective for function(s) needed for viral replication, which allow them to be recognized as a safer form for the vaccination of animals compared to attenuated live viruses. However, deletion of genes that are critical for the induction of protective immunity can diminish the vaccine potential of viral replicon particles. Therefore, the manipulation of viral replicon particles to produce a molecular adjuvant can be a way to increase immunogenicity of vaccines based on viral replicon particles. Chemokines are a class of chemotactic cytokines that control the migration of diverse cells of vertebrates. CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) binds to a receptor CXCR4, and CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling plays an important role in the migration of hematopoietic cells during embryogenesis and the attraction of leukocytes. In the present study, to evaluate the possible use of CXCL12 as a molecular adjuvant for an rVHSV-ΔG vaccine and to know differences between CXCL12a and CXCL12b in the adjuvant ability, we rescued VHSV replicon particles that are expressing olive flounder CXCL12a, CXCL12b, or eGFP (rVHSV-ΔG-CXCL12a, rVHSV-ΔG-CXCL12b, or rVHSV-ΔG-eGFP), and compared the ability to attract olive flounder leucocytes and to induce protection against a VHSV challenge. In the leukocytes migration assay, supernatants collected from cells infected with rVHSV-ΔG-CXCL12a and rVHSV-ΔG-CXCL12b showed significantly higher ability to attract olive flounder leukocytes than the supernatant of cells infected with rVHSV-ΔG-eGFP. Moreover, the significantly higher number of leukocytes were attracted to rVHSV-CXCL12a supernatant compared to rVHSV-CXCL12b supernatant, suggesting that CXCL12a would be more appropriate for the induction of immunity than CXCL12b in olive flounder. In the immunization experiment, olive flounder immunized with rVHSV-ΔG-CXCL12a showed significantly higher survival rate than fish immunized with rVHSV-ΔG-CXCL12b or rVHSV-ΔG-eGFP. In addition, fish immunized with rVHSV-ΔG-CXCL12a showed the highest serum neutralization activity. These results suggest the availability of CXCL12a for a molecular adjuvant of vaccines based on VHSV replicon particles.","['CXCL12a', 'Molecular adjuvant', 'VHSV replicon particle', 'Vaccine']","['Myoung Gwang Choi', 'Min Sun Kim', 'Tae-Jin Choi', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
Over-passage of epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells increased viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) replication.,"Vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated viruses can be a way to prevent viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) disease, and the efficiency of viral production is a critical factor that can determine the practical use of developed vaccines in aquaculture farms. To know the effects of epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells over-subculture on VHSV replication, the VHSV titer produced from high-passage EPC cells (subcultured more than 200 times in our laboratory) was compared to the titer produced from low-passage EPC cells (subcultured 5-15 times). Furthermore, to know whether immune factors are involved in VHSV titers, differences not only in the expression of Mx1 and ISG15 genes but also in the apoptosis progression by VHSV infection between high- and low-passage EPC cells were analyzed. The VHSV titers from high-passage EPC cells were significantly higher than titers from low-passage EPC cells, suggesting that the changed properties of EPC cells by over-subculture were favorable for VHSV proliferation. The DNA laddering of high-passage EPC cells by VHSV infection took a longer time than that of low-passage EPC cells, suggesting that over-subculture might delay apoptosis in VHSV infected EPC cells, and the delay of apoptosis by over-subculture can be thought as one of the factors that increased VHSV titers in high-passage EPC cells. The increased folds of Mx1 and ISG15 genes in high-passage EPC cells were significantly lower than those in low-passage EPC cells when exposed to either poly (I:C) or VHSV. However, the expression levels of Mx1 and ISG15 genes of high-passage EPC cells that were not stimulated with poly I:C or VHSV were almost equal to or higher than the expression levels of low-passage EPC cells that were exposed to poly (I:C) or VHSV. This result suggests that high-passage EPC cells were already in an excited state in type I interferon responses without any stimulants. The full open reading frame (ORF) sequences of Mx1 gene between high- and low-passage EPC cells were completely same. However, there were some differences in the amino acids sequences of ISG15 gene between high- and low-passage EPC cells, suggesting that ISG15-mediated pathways might be different between high- and low-passage EPC cells, which might influence on the replication of VHSV. The present results showed that the changed properties of EPC cells by over-subculture were favorable for VHSV proliferation.","['Apoptosis', 'Over-subculture', 'Type I interferon response', 'Viral replication']","['Min Sun Kim', 'Seung Hyuk Choi', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
Intranasal immunization with a recombinant outer membrane protein H based Haemorrhagic septicemia vaccine in dairy calves.,"Haemorrhagic septicemia (HS) is a contagious disease in cattle with high morbidity and mortality rates. HS vaccine in Thailand is an oil-adjuvant formulation, and is difficult to administer. The present study aimed to formulate and evaluate the protection in dairy calves conferred by immunization with an in-house intranasal HS vaccine. The intranasal vaccine was formulated in a total volume of 500 µl containing either 50 or 100 µg of the recombinant outer membrane protein H (rOmpH) of Pasteurella multocida strain M-1404 (serovar B:2), and 10 µg of Cytosine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) as a mucosal adjuvant. Intranasal immunizations were conducted three times at three-week intervals. The antibodies post-immunization were detected by indirect ELISA and demonstrated efficient in vitro activity in suppressing a P. multocida strain from the complement-mediated killing assay. An intranasal vaccine induced both the serum IgG and secretory IgA levels that were significantly higher than the level conferred by the parenteral vaccine (P<0.05). Challenge exposure was conducted with a P. multocida strain M-1404 at day 72 of the experiments. The immunized calves had reduced clinical signs after challenge exposure that would normally result in disease proliferation. We conclude that intranasal vaccination of calves with rOmpH with CpG-ODN 2007 stimulated serum and secretory antibodies to rOmpH and whole cells of P. multocida strain M-1404 antigen. Moreover, it would result in protection in calves against artificial P. multocida infection.","['CpG-ODN 2007', 'Pasteurella multocida', 'haemorrhagic septicemia', 'intranasal vaccine', 'recombinant outer membrane protein']","['Korkiat Muangthai', 'Pallop Tankaew', 'Thanya Varinrak', 'Ratchanee Uthi', 'Suvichai Rojanasthien', 'Takuo Sawada', 'Nattawooti Sthitmatee']"
Detection and surveillance of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus using real-time RT-PCR. I. Initial comparison of four protocols.,"Eight laboratories worked collectively to evaluate 4 real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) protocols targeting viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) being considered for deployment to a USA laboratory testing network. The protocols utilized previously published primers and probe sets developed for detection and surveillance of VHSV. All participating laboratories received and followed a standard operating protocol for extraction and for each of the rRT-PCR assays. Performance measures specifically evaluated included limit of detection (defined as the smallest amount of analyte in which 95% of the samples are classified as positive), analytical specificity, assay efficiency across genotype representatives, within- and between-plate variation within a laboratory, and variation between laboratories using the same platform, between platforms, and between software versions. This evaluation clearly demonstrated that the TaqMan®-based assay developed by Jonstrup et al. (2013; J Fish Dis 36:9-23) produced the most consistent analytical performance characteristics for detecting all genotypes of VHSV across the 8 participating laboratories.

Phylogeny of the Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus in European Aquaculture.,"One of the most valuable aquaculture fish in Europe is the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, but the profitability of trout production is threatened by a highly lethal infectious disease, viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), caused by the VHS virus (VHSV). For the past few decades, the subgenogroup Ia of VHSV has been the main cause of VHS outbreaks in European freshwater-farmed rainbow trout. Little is currently known, however, about the phylogenetic radiation of this Ia lineage into subordinate Ia clades and their subsequent geographical spread routes. We investigated this topic using the largest Ia-isolate dataset ever compiled, comprising 651 complete G gene sequences: 209 GenBank Ia isolates and 442 Ia isolates from this study. The sequences come from 11 European countries and cover the period 1971-2015. Based on this dataset, we documented the extensive spread of the Ia population and the strong mixing of Ia isolates, assumed to be the result of the Europe-wide trout trade. For example, the Ia lineage underwent a radiation into nine Ia clades, most of which are difficult to allocate to a specific geographic distribution. Furthermore, we found indications for two rapid, large-scale population growth events, and identified three polytomies among the Ia clades, both of which possibly indicate a rapid radiation. However, only about 4% of Ia haplotypes (out of 398) occur in more than one European country. This apparently conflicting finding regarding the Europe-wide spread and mixing of Ia isolates can be explained by the high mutation rate of VHSV. Accordingly, the mean period of occurrence of a single Ia haplotype was less than a full year, and we found a substitution rate of up to 7.813 × 10-4 nucleotides per site per year. Finally, we documented significant differences between Germany and Denmark regarding their VHS epidemiology, apparently due to those countries' individual handling of VHS.",[],"['Michael Cieslak', 'Susie S Mikkelsen', 'Helle F Skall', 'Marine Baud', 'Nicolas Diserens', 'Marc Y Engelsma', 'Olga L M Haenen', 'Shirin Mousakhani', 'Valentina Panzarin', 'Thomas Wahli', 'Niels J Olesen', 'Heike Schütze']"
Mouse model of haemorrhagic septicaemia: dissemination and multiplication of Pasteurella multocida B:2 in vital organs after intranasal and subcutaneous challenge in mice.,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is an endemic disease of bovines, occurring in most tropical regions of Asia and Africa. In the present study, the suitability of using mice to study pathogenesis of HS was assessed using mortality, mean death time and bacterial multiplication in vital organs after infection with live P multocida. Mice were infected with 10(5), 10(3) and 10(1)cfu of P. multocida B:2 via intranasal and subcutaneous routes along with control groups. Bacterial multiplication in lung, liver and spleen of mice were determined at 24 h interval after intranasal and subcutaneous challenge. More than 80 % of challenged mice died within 48 h of inoculation, irrespective of the dose and route of inoculation. A heavy bacterial load (up to 10(8)cfu) was observed in lung, liver and spleen of mice titrated at 24 h and following death of mice. Results of the present study indicate that even ten bacteria are enough to cause mortality in mice and the organism multiplies rapidly in respiratory epithelium and disseminated to other vital organs viz liver and spleen suggesting the important role of mouse model in investigating the pathogenesis and challenge studies during vaccine development.",[],"['Subhash Kharb', 'Shiv Charan']"
Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) vs. VHSV (Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus): A Review.,"Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a very valuable fish species both in Europe and China. The culture of this flatfish is well-established but several bacteria, viruses, and parasites can produce mortality or morbidity episodes in turbot farms. Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV) is one of the most threatening pathogens affecting turbot, because neither vaccines nor treatments are commercially available. Although the mortality in the turbot farms is relatively low, when this virus is detected all the stock have to be destroyed. The main goals that need to be improved in order to reduce the incidence of this disease is to know what are the strategies or molecules the host use to fight the virus and, in consequence, try to potentiate this response using different ways. Certain molecules can be selected as potential antiviral treatments because of their high protective effect against VHSV. On the other hand, the use of resistance markers for selective breeding is one of the most attractive approaches. This review englobes all the investigation concerning the immune interaction between turbot and VHSV, which until the last years was very scarce, and the knowledge about VHSV-resistance markers in turbot. Nowadays, the availability of abundant transcriptomic information and the recent sequencing of the turbot genome open the door to a more exhaustive and profuse investigation in these areas.

Effects of NV gene knock-out recombinant viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) on Mx gene expression in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells and olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"To determine whether the NV gene of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is related to the type I interferon response of hosts, expression of Mx gene in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells and in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) in response to infection with either wild-type VHSV or recombinant VHSVs (rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP and rVHSV-wild) was investigated. A reporter vector was constructed for measuring Mx gene expression using olive flounder Mx promoter, in which the reporter Metridia luciferase was designed to be excreted to culture medium to facilitate measurement. The highest increase of luciferase activity was detected from supernatant of cells infected with rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP. In contrast cells infected with wild-type VHSV showed a slight increase of the luciferase activity. Interestingly, cells infected with rVHSV-wild that has artificially changed nucleotides just before and after the NV gene ORF, also showed highly increased luciferase activity, but the increased amplitude was lower than that by rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP. These results strongly suggest that the NV protein of VHSV plays an important role in suppressing interferon response in host cells, which provides a condition for the viruses to efficiently proliferate in host cells. In an in vivo experiment, the Mx gene expression in olive flounder challenged with the rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP was clearly higher than fish challenged with rVHSV-wild or wild-type VHSV, suggesting that lacking of the NV gene in the genome of rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP brought to strong interferon response that subsequently inhibit viral replication in fish.",[],"['Min Sun Kim', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
"A Case-control Study of Haemorrhagic Septicaemia in Buffaloes and Cattle in Karachi, Pakistan, in 2012.","A retrospective epidemiological case-control study was performed in Karachi, Pakistan, from January to April 2013. The owners of 217 dairy cattle and buffalo farms from six different locations in Karachi were interviewed. The aim of the study was to identify risk factors associated with the presence of haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS). Farms with a history of at least one instance of sudden death in a dairy animal during 2012 and a positive clinical HS diagnosis (made by local veterinarians) were defined as cases. Farms having no history of sudden deaths in 2012 were defined as controls. Univariable analyses were initially conducted, and factors with P ≤ 0.25 were offered to a multivariable logistic regression model to identify putative risk factors. The final multivariable logistic model contained five factors. Vaccination was found to be a protective factor (OR = 0.22) along with the length of time cattle were kept on farm (months). For every extra month cattle were kept, the odds of HS disease were reduced by a factor of 0.9. In contrast, for every extra animal in a herd, the risk of infection increased by a factor of 1.01. Supplying underground water and the presence of foot and mouth disease on the farm increased the risk by 2.90 and 2.37, respectively. To understand the epidemiology of HS in Karachi dairy herds, more in-depth research is required to study the risk and protective factors identified in this survey and to evaluate risk mitigation strategies, where possible.","['\nPasteurella multocida\n', 'multivariable analysis', 'pasteurellosis', 'retrospective', 'transboundary animal disease', 'univariable analyses']","['A M Moustafa', 'S N Ali', 'M D Bennett', 'T H Hyndman', 'I D Robertson', 'J Edwards']"
Induction of anti-viral genes during acute infection with Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genogroup IVa in Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii).,"Infection with the aquatic rhabdovirus Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genogroup IVa results in high mortality in Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and is hypothesized to be a potential limiting factor for herring recovery. To investigate anti-viral immunity in the Pacific herring, four immune response genes were identified: the myxovirus resistance (Clpa-Mx), a major histocompatibility complex IB (named Clpa-UAA.001), the inducible immunoproteosome subunit 9 (Clpa-PSMB9) and the neutrophil chemotactic factor (Clpa-LECT2). Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays were developed based on these gene sequences to investigate the host immune response to acute VHSV infection following both injection and immersion challenge. Virus levels were measured by both plaque assay and RT-qPCR and peaked at day 6 during the 10-day exposure period for both groups of fish. The interferon stimulated genes (Clpa-Mx, -UAA.001, and -PSMB9) were significantly up-regulated in response to VHSV infection at both 6 and 10 days post-infection in both spleen and fin. Results from this study indicate that Pacific herring mount a robust, early antiviral response in both fin and spleen tissues.

Protection of Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus from viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) by Poly(I:C) immunization.,"In immunization of fish with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C], a synthetic double-stranded RNA, injection of Poly(I:C) followed by challenge with a live virus induces a transient, non-specific antiviral state by interferon activity. When exposed to a virus while in this antiviral state, the fish acquire a specific and protective immunity against the corresponding viral disease and survive. In the present study, the effiacy of Poly(I:C) immunization was investigated in japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus using viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) as a model; the minimum dose of Poly(I:C) required for inducing protection and the duration of the antiviral state were determined, and a potentially curative effect of Poly(I:C) administration was assessed. The antiviral state was induced by administration of Poly(I:C) doses ranging from 12.5 to 200 microg fish(-1). Minimum dose to induce the antiviral state (relative percentage survival, RPS: 90%) was 12.5 microg fish(-1). No curative effect of Poly(I:C) was observed in fish pre-infected with VHSV. Fish injected with 200 microg Poly(I:C) fish(-1) were highly protected (RPS: 100%) from an artificial challenge with VHSV, and specific antibodies against VHSV were detected. The corresponding high level of antiviral state against VHSV was attained 1 d post Poly(I:C) injection, lasted for 6 d and susequently decreased. Moreover, the surviving fish were highly protected from re-challenge with VHSV (RPS: 100%). Thus, it was considered that an immunity against viral hemorrhagic septicemia was induced in the Japanese flounder by injecting live VHSV following Poly(I:C) administration.",[],"['Ikuo Takami', 'Se Ryun Kwon', 'Toyohiko Nishizawa', 'Mamoru Yoshimizu']"
"Virulence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotypes Ia, IVa, IVb, and IVc in five fish species.","The susceptibility of yellow perch Perca flavescens, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, koi Cyprinus carpio koi, and Pacific herring Clupea pallasii to 4 strains of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was assessed. Fish were challenged via intraperitoneal injection with high (1 × 106 plaque-forming units, PFU) and low (1 × 103 PFU) doses of a European strain (genotype Ia), and North American strains from the West coast (genotype IVa), Great Lakes (genotype IVb), and the East coast (genotype IVc). Pacific herring were exposed to the same VHSV strains, but at a single dose of 5 × 103 PFU ml-1 by immersion in static seawater. Overall, yellow perch were the most susceptible, with cumulative percent mortality (CPM) ranging from 84 to 100%, and 30 to 93% in fish injected with high or low doses of virus, respectively. Rainbow trout and Chinook salmon experienced higher mortalities (47 to 98% CPM) after exposure to strain Ia than to the other virus genotypes. Pacific herring were most susceptible to strain IVa with an average CPM of 80% and moderately susceptible (42 to 52% CPM) to the other genotypes. Koi had very low susceptibility (≤5.0% CPM) to all 4 VHSV strains. Fish tested at 7 d post challenge were positive for all virus strains, with yellow perch having the highest prevalence and concentrations of virus, and koi the lowest. While genotype Ia had higher virulence in salmonid species, there was little difference in virulence or host-specificity between isolates from subtypes IVa, IVb, and IVc.

Olive flounder CD276 (B7-H3) a coinhibitory molecule for T cells: Responses during viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) stimulation.,"Coinhibitory pathways in the B7-CD28 family provide critical inhibitory signals that regulate immune homeostasis, defense and protect tissue integrity. CD276 (B7-H3) is an important immune checkpoint member of this family, which is induced on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and plays an important role in the inhibition of T-cell function. We have characterized the CD276 gene of olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. OfCD276 has an ORF of 912 bp that codes for 303 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 33 kDa. It is a type I transmembrane protein with a single extracellular V- and C-like Ig domains, a transmembrane region, and a highly diverse cytoplasmic tail. This gene was distinctly expressed in gill, spleen, and skin, and sparsely expressed in other tissues. Pathogen stimulation by VHSV revealed that transcription of OfCD276 was induced on early hours in liver and expressed late in head kidney, spleen, intestine and gill tissues. Flow cytometry analysis of leukocytes revealed the percentage of granulocytes and lymphocytes that expressed OfCD276 molecules on their cell surface was 85.1% and 3.1%, respectively. Our study shows a significant role played by this coinhibitory molecule that participate in the regulation of the cell mediated immune response.","['CD276', 'Coinhibitor', 'Immune checkpoint', 'Olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)', 'T cell immunity', 'VHSV']","['Jee Youn Hwang', 'Ji-Min Jeong', 'Mun-Gyeong Kwon', 'Jung Soo Seo', 'Seong Don Hwang', 'Maeng-Hyun Son', 'Jin-Sol Bae', 'Kwang-Min Choi', 'Dong-Hee Cho', 'Joseph Jeswin', 'Chan-Il Park']"
Modulation of proteome expression by F-type lectin during viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus infection in fathead minnow cells.,"Lectins found in fish tissues play an important role in the innate immune response against viral infection. A fucose-binding type lectin, RbFTL-3, from rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) was identified using expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis. The expression of RbFTL-3 mRNA was higher in intestine than other tissues of rock bream. To determine the function of RbFTL-3, VHSV-susceptible fathead minnow (FHM) cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) or pcDNA3.1(+)-RbFTL-3 and further infected with VHSV. The results show that the viability of FHM cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-RbFTL-3 is higher than that of cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) (relative cell viability: 28.9% vs 56.2%). A comparative proteomic analysis, performed to explore the proteins related to the protective effect of RbFTL-3 in the cells during VHSV infection, identified 90 proteins differentially expressed in VHSV-infected FHM cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) or pcDNA3.1(+)-RbFTL-3. The expression of RbFTL-3 inhibits a vascular-sorting protein (SNF8) and diminishes the loss of prothrombin, which are closely associated with controlling viral budding and hemorrhage in fish cells, respectively. Subsequent Ingenuity Pathways Analysis enabled prediction of their biofunctional groupings and interaction networks. The results suggest RbFTL-3 modulates the expression of proteins related to viral budding (SNF8, CCT5 and TUBB) and thrombin signaling (F2) to increase the viability of VHSV infected cells.

Use of a two-step ultrafiltration procedure to concentrate viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in seawater.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) has been reported to be stable in both fresh as well as seawater, suggesting that VHSV exists in natural aquatic environments and might have an effect on the wild and cultured fish. However, VHSV is below the detectable limits of laboratory tests in natural seawater. In this study, a two-step ultrafiltration (UF) procedure was used to concentration of VHSV in seawater, providing samples that were tested for infectivity by cell culture and the presence of VHSV by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) methods. Overall, VHSV was approximately concentrated 100-1000 times in 1, 5 and 10 L, seawater volumes respectively: from 2.81×10(6) to 6.53×10(7)/mL and 10(3.3) to 10(3.8)TCID50/mL prior to the UF procedure, to 3.78×10(8), 1.16 × 10(11), and 9.12 × 10(10)/mL after the procedure. This is the first report of concentrating VHSV using an UF method that was specifically designed for seawater samples. In addition, the two-step UF procedure appears to be compatible with viral cell culture and qRT-PCR methods.

Passive immunization of Pacific herring against viral hemorrhagic septicemia.,"The plasma of Pacific herring Clupea pallasii that survived laboratory-induced viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) epizootics contained humoral substances that, when injected into naive animals, conferred passive immunity against the disease. Among groups exposed to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), injection of donor plasma from VHS survivors resulted in significantly greater survival (50%) and significantly lower tissue titers (1.5 x 10(5) plaque-forming units [PFU]/g) than the injection of plasma from VHSV-naive donors (6% survival; 3.7 x 10(6) PFU/g). Additionally, the magnitude of the protective immune response increased during the postexposure period; plasma that was collected from survivors at 123 d postexposure (931 degree-days) provided greater protection than plasma collected from survivors at 60 d postexposure (409 degree-days). These results provide proof of concept that the VHSV exposure history of Pacific herring populations can be determined post hoc; furthermore, the results can be used as the foundation for developing additional high-throughput diagnostic techniques that may be effective at quantifying herd immunity and forecasting the potential for future VHS epizootics in populations of wild Pacific herring.",[],"['P K Hershberger', 'J L Gregg', 'C A Grady', 'S E LaPatra', 'J R Winton']"
"Temporal Variation in Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus Antibodies in Freshwater Drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) Indicates Cyclic Transmission in Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin.","Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is an emerging pathogen that causes mass mortality in multiple fish species. In 2007, the Great Lakes freshwater strain, type IVb, caused a large die-off of freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) in Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, USA. To evaluate the persistence and transmission of VHSV, freshwater drum from Lake Winnebago were tested for antibodies to the virus using recently developed virus neutralization (VN) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. Samples were also tested by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) to detect viral RNA. Of 548 serum samples tested, 44 (8.03%) were positive by VN (titers ranging from 1:16 to 1:1,024) and 45 (8.21%) were positive by ELISA, including 7 fish positive by both assays. Antibody prevalence increased with age and was higher in one northwestern area of Lake Winnebago than in other areas. Of 3,864 tissues sampled from 551 fish, 1 spleen and 1 kidney sample from a single adult female fish collected in the spring of 2012 tested positive for VHSV by rRT-PCR, and serum from the same fish tested positive by VN and ELISA. These results suggest that VHSV persists and viral transmission may be active in Lake Winnebago even in years following outbreaks and that wild fish may survive VHSV infection and maintain detectable antibody titers while harboring viral RNA. Influxes of immunologically naive juvenile fish through recruitment may reduce herd immunity, allow VHSV to persist, and drive superannual cycles of transmission that may sporadically manifest as fish kills.

Oral immunization of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) with recombinant live viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) induces protection against VHSV infection.,"A recombinant viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP) that has enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene instead of NV gene was previously generated using reverse genetics technology. In this study, potential of the rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP to be used as a live oral vaccine candidate was assessed. The presence of the recombinant virus in internal organs of orally administered olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Although the recombinant VHSV-specific band was detected only when the number of PCR cycle was increased to 35, the band was detected from internal organs, such as kidney, spleen, and liver of fish that were reared at either 15 °C or 20 °C till even 20 days, suggesting that a few orally administered rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP might be transported to internal organs, and might keep weak replication ability in the organs. VHSV-neutralizing activity was induced by oral immunization of olive flounder with the NV gene knock-out recombinant VHSV not only in skin and intestinal mucus but also in serum, suggesting that mucosal and systemic adaptive immune responses were elicited by oral immunization. In challenge experiment, groups of fish immunized with 10⁴, 10⁵, and 2 × 10⁵ PFU of rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP/fish showed 25%, 50%, and 70% of relative percent survival (RPS), respectively. The RPSs were elevated to 60%, 75%, and 90% by a boost immunization in fish boost immunized with 10⁴, 10⁵, and 2 × 10⁵ PFU of rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP, respectively. The cumulative mortality of fish in the control groups was 100%. Conclusionly, the present results demonstrate that the NV gene knock-out recombinant VHSV administered orally to olive flounder can induce dose- and boosting-dependent VHSV-neutralizing antibody in mucus and serum, and can provide a high protection in olive flounder against a virulent VHSV challenge.",[],"['Min Sun Kim', 'Dong Soo Kim', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
"Spread of the emerging viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus strain, genotype IVb, in Michigan, USA.","In 2003, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) emerged in the Laurentian Great Lakes causing serious losses in a number of ecologically and recreationally important fish species. Within six years, despite concerted managerial preventive measures, the virus spread into the five Great Lakes and to a number of inland waterbodies. In response to this emerging threat, cooperative efforts between the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MI DNR), the Michigan State University Aquatic Animal Health Laboratory (MSU-AAHL), and the United States Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (USDA-APHIS) were focused on performing a series of general and VHSV-targeted surveillances to determine the extent of virus trafficking in the State of Michigan. Herein we describe six years (2005-2010) of testing, covering hundreds of sites throughout Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas. A total of 96,228 fish representing 73 species were checked for lesions suggestive of VHSV and their internal organs tested for the presence of VHSV using susceptible cell lines. Of the 1,823 cases tested, 30 cases from 19 fish species tested positive for VHSV by tissue culture and were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Gene sequence analyses of all VHSV isolates retrieved in Michigan demonstrated that they belong to the emerging sublineage ""b"" of the North American VHSV genotype IV. These findings underscore the complexity of VHSV ecology in the Great Lakes basin and the critical need for rigorous legislation and regulatory guidelines in order to reduce the virus spread within and outside of the Laurentian Great Lakes watershed.","['Laurentian Great Lakes', 'Michigan', 'emerging disease', 'viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Mohamed Faisal', 'Megan Shavalier', 'Robert K Kim', 'Elena V Millard', 'Michelle R Gunn', 'Andrew D Winters', 'Carolyn A Schulz', 'Alaa Eissa', 'Michael V Thomas', 'Martha Wolgamood', 'Gary E Whelan', 'James Winton']"
Gene Diversification of an Emerging Pathogen: A Decade of Mutation in a Novel Fish Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS) Substrain since Its First Appearance in the Laurentian Great Lakes.,"Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSv) is an RNA rhabdovirus, which causes one of the world's most serious fish diseases, infecting >80 freshwater and marine species across the Northern Hemisphere. A new, novel, and especially virulent substrain-VHSv-IVb-first appeared in the Laurentian Great Lakes about a decade ago, resulting in massive fish kills. It rapidly spread and has genetically diversified. This study analyzes temporal and spatial mutational patterns of VHSv-IVb across the Great Lakes for the novel non-virion (Nv) gene that is unique to this group of novirhabdoviruses, in relation to its glycoprotein (G), phosphoprotein (P), and matrix (M) genes. Results show that the Nv-gene has been evolving the fastest (k = 2.0 x 10-3 substitutions/site/year), with the G-gene at ~1/7 that rate (k = 2.8 x 10-4). Most (all but one) of the 12 unique Nv- haplotypes identified encode different amino acids, totaling 26 changes. Among the 12 corresponding G-gene haplotypes, seven vary in amino acids with eight total changes. The P- and M- genes are more evolutionarily conserved, evolving at just ~1/15 (k = 1.2 x 10-4) of the Nv-gene's rate. The 12 isolates contained four P-gene haplotypes with two amino acid changes, and six M-gene haplotypes with three amino acid differences. Patterns of evolutionary changes coincided among the genes for some of the isolates, but appeared independent in others. New viral variants were discovered following the large 2006 outbreak; such differentiation may have been in response to fish populations developing resistance, meriting further investigation. Two 2012 variants were isolated by us from central Lake Erie fish that lacked classic VHSv symptoms, having genetically distinctive Nv-, G-, and M-gene sequences (with one of them also differing in its P-gene); they differ from each other by a G-gene amino acid change and also differ from all other isolates by a shared Nv-gene amino acid change. Such rapid evolutionary differentiation may allow new viral variants to evade fish host recognition and immune responses, facilitating long-time persistence along with expansion to new geographic areas.",[],"['Carol A Stepien', 'Lindsey R Pierce', 'Douglas W Leaman', 'Megan D Niner', 'Brian S Shepherd']"
Development of a walleye spleen stromal cell line sensitive to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV IVb) and to protection by synthetic dsRNA.,"A cell line, WE-spleen6, has been developed from the stromal layer of primary spleen cell cultures. On conventional plastic, WE-spleen6 cells had a spindle-shaped morphology at low cell density but grew to become epithelial-like at confluency. On the commercial extracellular matrix (ECM), Matrigel, the cells remained spindle-shaped and formed lumen-like structures. WE-spleen6 cells had intermediate filament protein, vimentin and the ECM protein, collagen I, but not smooth muscle α-actin (SMA) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) and lacked alkaline phosphatase and phagocytic activities. WE-spleen6 was more susceptible to infection with VHSV IVb than a fibroblast and epithelial cell lines from the walleye caudal fin, WE-cfin11f and WE-cfin11e, respectively. Viral transcripts and proteins appeared earlier in WE-spleen6 cultures as did cytopathic effect (CPE) and significant virus production. The synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (pIC), induced the antiviral protein Mx in both cell lines. Treating WE-spleen6 cultures with pIC prior to infection with VHSV IVb inhibited the early accumulation of viral transcripts and proteins and delayed the appearance of CPE and significant viral production. Of particular note, pIC caused the disappearance of viral P protein 2 days post infection. WE-spleen6 should be useful for investigating the impact of VHSV IVb on hematopoietic organs and the actions of pIC on the rhabdovirus life cycle.

Development and validation of a reverse transcription quantitative PCR for universal detection of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infects over 70 fish species inhabiting marine, brackish or freshwater environments throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Over its geographic range, 4 VHSV genotypes and multiple subtypes exist. Here, we describe the development and validation of a rapid, sensitive and specific real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR assay (RT-qPCR) that amplifies sequence from representative isolates of all VHSV genotypes (I, II, III and IV). The pan-specific VHSV RT-qPCR assay reliably detects 100 copies of VHSV nucleoprotein RNA without cross-reacting with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, spring viremia of carp virus or aquatic birnavirus. Test performance characteristics evaluated on experimentally infected Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. revealed a diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) > or = 93% and specificity (DSp) = 100%. The repeatability and reproducibility of the procedure was exceptionally high, with 93% agreement among test results within and between 2 laboratories. Furthermore, proficiency testing demonstrated the VHSV RT-qPCR assay to be easily transferred to and performed by a total of 9 technicians representing 4 laboratories in 2 countries. The assay performed equivalent to the traditional detection method of virus isolation via cell culture with the advantage of faster turnaround times and high throughput capacity, further suggesting the suitability of the use of this VHSV RT-qPCR in a diagnostic setting.",[],"['Kyle A Garver', 'Laura M Hawley', 'Carol A McClure', 'Tamara Schroeder', 'Sandra Aldous', 'Fiona Doig', 'Michael Snow', 'Sandra Edes', 'Catherine Baynes', 'Jon Richard']"

The mortality rate of intraperitoneal-infected goldfish was 10 to 32%, although the virus was detected by quantitative RT-PCR in 77% (65/84) of the survivors at the end of the 42 d trial, suggesting a carrier state. Severe gross lesions were observed in many of the moribund and dead goldfish such as hemorrhaging in the skin, fin, liver, kidney, brain, intestine, and eye as well as abdominal distension, bilateral exophthalmia, and splenomegaly.

Mortality and carrier status of bluegills exposed to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus genotype IVb at different temperatures.,"The emergence of the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVb (VHSV-IVb) in the Great Lakes of North America has led to concern that the virus might spread to natural fisheries and aquaculture in the southern USA. We exposed bluegills Lepomis macrochirus to VHSV-IVb by intraperitoneal injection at six temperatures from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C and followed the disease course by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qrt-RT-PCR). Mortality of injected fish was 90% at 10 degrees C, 35% at 14 degrees C, and 10% at 18 degrees C; no mortality attributable to VHSV was observed at temperatures of 22-30 degrees C. In survivors tested at 21 d postchallenge, viral copies and prevalence determined by qrt-RT-PCR were inversely related to temperature, and VHSV-IVb could not be detected in fish held at temperatures above 22 degrees C. Similar results were obtained for bluegills that were exposed by cohabitation with the intraperitoneally injected fish. Acclimation of the fish to 12 degrees C after 21 d at higher temperatures did not appear to cause a re-emergence of the virus. Based on our findings, the temperature range of VHSV-IVb appears to be the same as published values for VHSV genotype I, which has an optimum of 9-12 degrees C and an upper limit of 18-20 degrees C.",[],"['Andrew E Goodwin', 'Gwenn E Merry']"
New sites of localisation of Pasteurella multocida B:2 in buffalo surviving experimental haemorrhagic septicaemia.,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is an acute septicaemic disease of buffalo and cattle caused by Pasteurella multocida B:2 and E:2. Field outbreaks of HS are known to result in localisation of bacteria in the tonsils of surviving buffalo, confirming that animals can become carriers and the role of respiratory tract in the transmission of the disease. This report describes additional sites of localisation of P. multocida B:2 in surviving buffalo following experimental induction of HS.Following P. multocida B:2 infection, all calves in group 1 and one calf in group 2 that was allowed to commingle with infected calves from group 1 were euthanised within 48 h. Pasteurella multocida B:2 was detected from the nasal and rectal swab samples on days 5 and 6 from the remaining calves in group 2. The first injection of dexamethasone into the carrier animals resulted in reemergence in samples from the nose, rectum and vagina. However, subsequent dexamethasone injections failed to re-activate P. multocida B:2. When surviving carrier calves in group 2 were euthanised at the end of the experiment, P. multocida B:2 was detected in the lungs and various organs of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts.Commingling naive buffalo calves with calves acutely infected with P. multocida B:2 resulted in carriers among surviving buffalo.

Experimental Infection of Koi Carp with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus type IVb.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) type IVb has a wide host range that includes at least three cyprinid species: Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas, Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides, and Bluntnose Minnow P. notatus. To date, VHSV IVb has only been found in wild fish. However, the possibility of infection in culture facilities remains. Koi Carp Cyprinus carpio are a major ornamental aquaculture species in the United States; however, their potential to become infected with VHSV IVb has not yet been examined. In this study, we exposed Koi to 3 × 10(6) PFU VHSV Great Lakes isolate MI03 by intraperitoneal injection. While we observed low mortality (0-5%), VHSV was isolated in cell culture from the majority of fish up to 28 d postexposure (DPE) and was detected by a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay up to 90 DPE, when the trial was terminated. The results of this study strongly suggest that Koi are at risk for VHSV infection, although their susceptibility by intraperitoneal injection appears to be low. This study also provides more evidence of the sensitivity of qRT-PCR for detection of VHSV IVb.",[],"['Emily R Cornwell', 'Sandra L Labuda', 'Geoffrey H Groocock', 'Rodman G Getchell', 'Paul R Bowser']"
Evaluation of an In-house indirect ELISA for detection of antibody against haemorrhagic septicemia in Asian elephants.,"Pasteurella multocida causes haemorrhagic septicemia in livestock and wild animals, including elephants. The disease has been reported in Asian elephants in India and Sri Lanka, but to date there have been no reported cases in Thailand. ELISA or indirect hemagglutination assays (IHA) have been demonstrated to be able to detect the antibody against the disease in cattle, but no data are available for elephants. The present study reports a novel in-house indirect ELISA for antibody detection of haemorrhagic septicemia in Asian elephants, and evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of the method using a Bayesian approach. The characteristics of ELISA and IHA were analyzed using a one population Bayesian model assuming conditional dependence between these two diagnostic tests. The IHA was performed as recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) manual for haemorrhagic septicemia. An in-house indirect ELISA was developed with a heat extract antigen of P. multocida strain M-1404 (serovar B:2) as a coating antigen and rabbit anti-immunoglobulin G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (eIgG-HRP). The checkerboard titration method was done using elephant sera immunized with P. multocida bacterin and negative sera from colostrum-deprived elephant calves. The concentrations of heat extract antigen (160μg/ml), sample serum (1:100), and eIgG-HRP (1:1000) were optimal for the assay. The calculated cut-off value was 0.103. Of the elephant sera, 50.59% (43/85) were considered seropositive by ELISA. The sensitivity of the ELISA test was higher than that of the IHA test [median=86.5%, 95% posterior probability interval (PPI)=52.5-98.9%] while the specificity was lower (median=54.1%, PPI=43.6-64.7%). The median sensitivity and specificity of IHA were 80.5% (PPI=43.8-98.0%) and 78.4% (PPI=69.0-87.0%), respectively. These findings suggest that our in-house indirect ELISA can be used as a tool to detect the antibody against haemorrhagic septicemia in Asian elephants.","['Asian elephant', 'Bayesian analysis', 'Haemorrhagic septicemia', 'Indirect ELISA']","['Pallop Tankaew', 'Thawatchai Singh-La', 'Chatchote Titaram', 'Veerasak Punyapornwittaya', 'Preeyanat Vongchan', 'Takuo Sawada', 'Nattawooti Sthitmatee']"
In vitro neutralization of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus by plasma from immunized zebrafish.,"We studied humoral long-term adaptive viral neutralization responses in zebrafish (Danio rerio), an increasingly useful vertebrate model for viral diseases actually limited by the absence of standardized anti-zebrafish immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. We established an alternative method, similar to those used in other fish, to achieve a first estimation of zebrafish anti-viral antibody-like responses. We used the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) model because, although protection after this non-natural infection was demonstrated in cold-acclimatized zebrafish, little is known about their induced anti-VHSV antibody-like responses. Therefore, we first optimized a micro-neutralization method based on immunostaining VHSV-infected fish cell monolayers to detect zebrafish neutralizing activity in plasma samples in one day. We then used the method to measure the specific anti-VHSV neutralization in plasma obtained from individual zebrafish under various VHSV challenges or immunization protocols. The neutralizing activity was inhibited by protein A-sepharose and rabbit anti-zebrafish IgM antibodies, suggesting the implication of IgM zebrafish antibodies in such responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate detectable and significant VHSV neutralization titers in zebrafish surviving VHSV infections. This micro-method might be useful, not only for the follow-up of infection/vaccine development in the zebrafish/VHSV model in particular, but also for similar work involving other in vitro neutralizable zebrafish pathogens. This technique might also further the development of alternative ELISA assay methods to measure specific immunoglobulins in zebrafish.",[],"['Blanca Chinchilla', 'Eduardo Gomez-Casado', 'Paloma Encinas', 'Alberto Falco', 'Amparo Estepa', 'Julio Coll']"
Specific nucleotides at the 3'-terminal promoter of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus are important for virulence in vitro and in vivo.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), a member of the Novirhabdovirus genus, contains an 11-nucleotide conserved sequence at the terminal 3'- and 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) that are complementary. To study the importance of nucleotides in the 3'-UTR of VHSV for replication of novirhabdoviruses, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues at the 3'-terminus and generated mutant viruses using a reverse genetics approach. Assessment of growth kinetics and in vitro real-time cytopathogenicity studies showed that the order of two nucleotides (A4G5) of the 3'-terminus of VHSV directly affects growth kinetics in vitro. The mutant A4G-G5A virus has reduced total positive-strand RNA synthesis efficiency (51% of wild-type) at 48h post-transfection and 70h delay in causing complete cytopathic effect in susceptible fish cells, as compared to the WT-VHSV. Furthermore, when the A4G-G5A virus was used to challenge zebrafish, it exhibited reduced pathogenicity (54% lower end-point mortality) compared to the WT-VHSV. From these studies, we infer that specific residues in the 3'-UTR of VHSV have a promoter function and are essential to modulate the virulence in cells and pathogenicity in fish.

Efficacy of vaccination of calves against hemorrhagic septicemia with a live aroA derivative of Pasteurella multocida B:2 by two different routes of administration.,"Two groups of four calves each were immunized either intramuscularly (i.m. vaccinated) or intranasally (i.n. vaccinated) at 2 and 6 weeks of age with ca. 10(9) CFU of a derivative of P. multocida serotype B:2 strain 85020 containing a deletion in the aroA gene (strain JRMT12). Both groups of calves and three unvaccinated control calves were challenged subcutaneously at 8 weeks of age with ca. 10(7) CFU of the wild-type 85020 strain. The first and second vaccinations caused a significant pyrexia and increase in the mean demeanor score (P <0.05) in i.m. but not i.n. vaccinated calves. Serum agglutinating activity against whole cells of P. multocida strain 85020 and immunoglobulin G antibody concentrations increased after the second vaccination in i.m. but not in i.n. vaccinated animals, and this difference was statistically significant (P <0.05). Concentrations of serum amyloid A (SAA) increased significantly 3 h after both the primary (P <0.05) and booster (P <0.001) i.m. vaccinations, but not in i.n. vaccinated calves. All four i.m. vaccinated calves were solidly immune to challenge with wild-type P. multocida B:2. However, the mean rectal temperatures, demeanor scores, and serum SAA concentrations of i.n. vaccinated and control calves increased significantly (P <0.01). Three i.n. vaccinated and two control calves were killed for humane reasons within 14 h postchallenge, and postmortem examination revealed pathological lesions consistent with hemorrhagic septicemia. These data showed that the aroA mutant strain, given i.m. as two doses 4 weeks apart, acted as an effective live-attenuated vaccine strain to protect calves against challenge with the virulent parent strain.",[],"['J Christopher Hodgson', 'Anna Finucane', 'Mark P Dagleish', 'Saeed Ataei', 'Roger Parton', 'John G Coote']"

Chronic and persistent viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus infections in Pacific herring.,"Chronic viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infections were established in a laboratory stock of Pacific herring Clupea pallasii held in a large-volume tank supplied with pathogen-free seawater at temperatures ranging from 6.8 to 11.6 degrees C. The infections were characterized by viral persistence for extended periods and near-background levels of host mortality. Infectious virus was recovered from mortalities occurring up to 167 d post-exposure and was detected in normal-appearing herring for as long as 224 d following initial challenge. Geometric mean viral titers were generally as high as or higher in brain tissues than in pools of kidney and spleen tissues, with overall prevalence of infection being higher in the brain. Upon re-exposure to VHSV in a standard laboratory challenge, negligible mortality occurred among groups of herring that were either chronically infected or fully recovered, indicating that survival from chronic manifestations conferred protection against future disease. However, some survivors of chronic VHS infections were capable of replicating virus upon re-exposure. Demonstration of a chronic manifestation of VHSV infection among Pacific herring maintained at ambient seawater temperatures provides insights into the mechanisms by which the virus is maintained among populations of endemic hosts.",[],"['P K Hershberger', 'J L Gregg', 'C A Grady', 'L Taylor', 'J R Winton']"
Early immune responses in rainbow trout liver upon viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection.,"Among the essential metabolic functions of the liver, in mammals, a role as mediator of systemic and local innate immunity has also been reported. Although the presence of an important leukocyte population in mammalian liver is well documented, the characterization of leukocyte populations in the teleost liver has been only scarcely addressed. In the current work, we have confirmed the presence of IgM+, IgD+, IgT+, CD8α+, CD3+ cells, and cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver by flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry analysis. Additionally, the effect of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) on the liver immune response was assessed. First, we studied the effect of viral intraperitoneal injection on the transcription of a wide selection of immune genes at days 1, 2 and 5 post-infection. These included a group of leukocyte markers genes, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), chemokines, chemokine receptor genes, and other genes involved in the early immune response and in acute phase reaction. Our results indicate that T lymphocytes play a key role in the initial response to VHSV in the liver, since CD3, CD8, CD4, perforin, Mx and interferon (IFN) transcription levels were up-regulated in response to VHSV. Consequently, flow cytometry analysis of CD8α+ cells in liver and spleen at day 5 post-infection revealed a decrease in the number of CD8α+ cells in the spleen and an increased population in the liver. No differences were found however in the percentages of B lymphocyte (IgM+ or IgD+) populations. In addition, a strong up-regulation in the transcription levels of several PRRs and chemokines was observed from the second day of infection, indicating an important role of these factors in the response of the liver to viral infections.

Transcription of immune genes upon challenge with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in DNA vaccinated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"Even though DNA vaccination has proven as one of the most effective methods in controlling fish rhabdoviruses, the immune mechanisms responsible for protection are still unknown. Many studies have focused on studying which cytokines and immune genes are triggered in response to the vaccine at different times post-vaccination. However, to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for protection, to our understanding it is also of great relevance to study the immune response to the virus in fish that have been previously vaccinated and compare it to the effects that the virus might have on non-vaccinated fish. This type of study has never been performed to date in fish. Thus, in the current work, we vaccinated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with a DNA vaccine against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), and 30 days post-vaccination we challenged the fish with a virulent VHSV. It was then, that we studied the immune response to the virus at very early times post-infection in fish, in order to compare the effects of VHSV on vaccinated or non-vaccinated trout. We studied the levels of expression of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ialpha and IIalpha genes, immunoglobulin M (IgM), CD8alpha, type I interferon (IFN), Mx, IFN-gamma and natural killer enhancing factor (NKEF) in head kidney, spleen and blood. When we compared the effect that VHSV had on vaccinated fish to the effect that the virus produced in fish vaccinated with the empty plasmid, the genes that were significantly up-regulated were IL-1beta and MHC IIalpha in the spleen at day 1 post-infection, MHC Ialpha in all organs at day 1 post-infection, and IFN and Mx in the spleen and blood at days 1 and 3 post-infection, respectively. Genes that correlate with an increased specific immune response were not significantly increased in response to VHSV in these vaccinated animals. The results suggest that DNA vaccination induces a memory state in fish that, on the contrary to what would occur in mammals, primes the non-specific immune responses upon a later encounter with the virus.",[],"['A Cuesta', 'C Tafalla']"

"Evolution of the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus: divergence, selection and origin.","Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is an economically significant rhabdovirus that affects an increasing number of freshwater and marine fish species. Extensive studies have been conducted on the molecular epizootiology, genetic diversity, and phylogeny of VHSV. However, there are discrepancies between the reported estimates of the nucleotide substitution rate for the G gene and the divergence times for the genotypes. Herein, Bayesian coalescent analyses were conducted to the time-stamped entire coding sequences of the six VHSV genes. Rate estimates based on the G gene indicated that the marine genotypes/subtypes might not all evolve slower than their major European freshwater counterpart. Age calculations on the six genes revealed that the first bifurcation event of the analyzed isolates might have taken place within the last 300 years, which was much younger than previously thought. Selection analyses suggested that two codons of the G gene might be positively selected. Surveys of codon usage bias showed that the P, M and NV genes exhibited genotype-specific variations. Furthermore, we proposed that VHSV originated from the Pacific Northwest of North America.","['Divergence', 'Substitution rate', 'TMRCA', 'VHSV']","['Mei He', 'Xue-Chun Yan', 'Yang Liang', 'Xiao-Wen Sun', 'Chun-Bo Teng']"
MLST typing of Pasteurella multocida associated with haemorrhagic septicaemia and development of a real-time PCR specific for haemorrhagic septicaemia associated isolates.,"Two serovars of Pasteurella multocida, B:2 and E:2, have been reportedly associated with haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), a peracute and devastating disease mainly affecting cattle and water buffaloes. We multilocus sequence typed (MLST) 64 isolates of P. multocida including 55 associated with HS and found that they mainly included sequence type (ST) 122 (n=50) and rarely ST63 (n=1), ST147 (n=2) and ST162 (n=2) compared to other members of the species isolated from other lesion types and hosts. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms suitable for specific detection of STs associated with HS were detected in the est gene. A new HS-est-RT-PCR (est indicating the target gene) specifically detected ST122, ST63, ST147 and ST162 associated with HS. The new HS-est-RT-PCR did not detect strains of ST151 with capsular type D isolated from pigs that were found positive with a previously published HS PCR detection method. The new HS-est-RT-PCR represents a fast and specific detection of the specific types of P. multocida involved in HS. The HS-est-RT-PCR developed in the current study seems to more accurately identify isolates of P. multocida associated with HS compared to PCR detection methods previously published.","['Acute septicaemia', 'Clonal complex ST122', 'Rirdc']","['Andreas Petersen', 'Magne Bisgaard', 'Kirsty Townsend', 'Henrik Christensen']"
Absence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and infectious hemorrhagic necrosis virus (INHV) in a Tunisian fish farm: a case study.,"Beyond the obvious problems related to the sustainable management of wild stocks, current fish farming practices in the Mediterranean area entail important environmental risks and potential outbreaks of fish diseases linked to massive translocations across regional boundaries. Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) are well-known fish diseases caused by the VHSV and IHNV viruses, and positive cases are subject to obligatory reporting to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). In August 2004, the OIE published the first record of a VHS outbreak in a sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) aquaculture facility on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. However, D. labrax is not considered as a susceptible host species for viral hemorrhagic septicaemia according to OIE's International Aquatic Animal Health Code (2009) and VHSV was not previously reported in the Mediterranean. In this sense and given the high risk of disease translocation associated with farmed fish in marine aquaculture, the present study was aimed at investigating the presence of VHSV and IHNV in stocks of sea bass and sea bream (Sparus aurata) reared inside a Tunisian coastal fish farm. Cell culture, IFAT and RT-PCR were applied to screen for both VHSV and IHNV in 69 pooled samples of sea bass and 24 pooled samples of sea bream. All three techniques showed the absence of both viruses within fish at the selected site.",[],"['N Cherif', 'S Hammami']"
Pepscan mapping of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus glycoprotein G major lineal determinants implicated in triggering host cell antiviral responses mediated by type I interferon.,"Surface glycoproteins of enveloped virus are potent elicitors of type I interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses in a way that may be independent of the well-studied genome-mediated route. However, the viral glycoprotein determinants responsible for initiating the IFN response remain unidentified. In this study, we have used a collection of 60 synthetic 20-mer overlapping peptides (pepscan) spanning the full length of glycoprotein G (gpG) of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) to investigate what regions of this protein are implicated in triggering the type I IFN-associated immune responses. Briefly, two regions with ability to increase severalfold the basal expression level of the IFN-stimulated mx gene and to restrict the spread of virus among responder cells were mapped to amino acid residues 280 to 310 and 340 to 370 of the gpG protein of VHSV. In addition, the results obtained suggest that an interaction between VHSV gpG and integrins might trigger the host IFN-mediated antiviral response after VHSV infection. Since it is known that type I IFN plays an important role in determining/modulating the protective-antigen-specific immune responses, the identification of viral glycoprotein determinants directly implicated in the type I IFN induction might be of special interest for designing new adjuvants and/or more-efficient and cost-effective viral vaccines as well as for improving our knowledge on how to stimulate the innate immune system.",[],"['V Chico', 'A Martinez-Lopez', 'M Ortega-Villaizan', 'A Falco', 'L Perez', 'J M Coll', 'A Estepa']"
Fugu double U6 promoter-driven long double-stranded RNA inhibits proliferation of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in fish cell lines.,"A long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-producing vector driven by fugu double U6 promotors, in which the two promoters were arranged in a head-to-head fashion, was newly constructed. To determine whether the DNA-vector-based long dsRNAs can induce sequence-specific RNA interference (RNAi), Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells and chinook salmon embryonic (CHSE-214) cells were transfected with the long dsRNA vector targeting the G gene of VHSV, and its effect on expression of the G gene and viral proliferation was investigated. The sequence-specific inhibitory effect was further confirmed by analysis of interferon (IFN)-triggered Mx1 gene expression and cross-protection against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). The fugu double U6 promoter-driven vector successfully produced long dsRNAs in EPC cells, a system that allows continuous production of long dsRNAs in transfected cells. The plasmid-based long dsRNAs targeting the VHSV G gene effectively suppressed G gene expression, but control dsRNAs targeting the EGFP gene did not. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in Mx gene expression between cells transfected with the long dsRNA-producing vector and those transfected with the control empty vector. These results suggest that G gene expression was suppressed not by type-I-IFN-mediated nonspecific inhibition but in a sequence-specific manner. Both EPC and CHSE-214 cells transfected with plasmids producing long dsRNAs targeting the VHSV G gene were protected against VHSV infection but were not protected against IHNV infection, suggesting sequence-specific RNAi-mediated inhibition of viral proliferation. In conclusion, we show, for the first time, long-dsRNA-mediated RNAi in fish cells. The DNA-vector-based long dsRNAs may provide an efficient tool for analysis of gene function in fish cells without preliminary burdensome work for selection of effective siRNA clones, and it may be applied as an antiviral measure in cultured fish.",[],"['Min Sun Kim', 'Bo Young Jee', 'Mi Young Cho', 'Jin Woo Kim', 'Hyun Do Jeong', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
"Effect of chronic exposure to pendimethalin on the susceptibility of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss L., to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).","In this study, the in vivo effects of chronic pollution by the active substance (AS) pendimethalin, a dinitroaniline herbicide, on the susceptibility of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss L., to an experimental challenge with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) were assessed. After four weeks of exposure to fresh water (C group) or 500 ng L(-1) of AS (P500 group), the fish were challenged by immersion in water containing 10(4) TCID(50) mL(-1) of VHSV. While exposure to pendimethalin was maintained throughout the experiment, mortalities were recorded during the 40 days post-infection (dpi) and organs were collected from dead fish for virological examination. At the end of the experiment, anti-VHSV antibodies and the classical pathway of complement activity were assessed in trout plasma. Exposure to pendimethalin significantly affected the distribution of cumulative mortality accelerating death in fish infected by VHSV. Pendimethalin appeared to decrease the Mean Time to Death (MTD) after virus treatment from 14.9 days (C-VHSV) to 10.2 days (P500-VHSV). Nevertheless, by the end of the experiment, differences in cumulative mortality were no longer observed between the two groups, which had reached the same stage (50 percent). Furthermore, a higher concentration of the virus was recovered from the pools of organs from the P500-VHSV group than the C-VHSV group. Moreover, at 40 dpi, although no significant difference was observed in the immune response between the two groups, more fish in the P500-VHSV group had set up an immune response by secreting antibodies than in the control viral group (C-VSHV).",[],"['Morgane Danion', 'Stéphane Le Floch', 'Jeanne Castric', 'François Lamour', 'Joëlle Cabon', 'Claire Quentel']"

Differentially expressed genes after viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus infection in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"A strain of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) was isolated from cultured olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) during epizootics in South Korean. This strain showed high mortality to olive flounder in in vivo challenge experiment. The complete genomic RNA sequences were determined and phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of glycoprotein revealed that this isolate was grouped into genotype IVa of genus Novirhabdovirus. Expression profile of genes in olive flounder was analyzed at day 1 and day3 after infection with this VHSV isolate by using cDNA microarray containing olive flounder 13K cDNA clones. Microarray analysis revealed 785 up-regulated genes and 641 down-regulated genes by at least two-fold in virus-infected fish compared to healthy control groups. Among 785 up-regulated genes, we identified seven immune response-associated genes, including the interferon (IFN)-induced 56-kDa protein (IFI56), suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), interleukin 8 (IL-8), cluster of differentiation 83 (CD83), α-globin (HBA), VHSV-induced protein-6 (VHSV6), and cluster of differentiation antigen 9 (CD9).

Shedding of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (Genotype IVb) by experimentally infected muskellunge (Esox masquinongy).,"Previous experimental infection demonstrated that juvenile muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) can survive experimental infection of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, Genotype IVb (VHSV IVb) at a low concentration of exposure. Herein we report that survivors of experimental infection with VHSV IVb shed the virus into the surrounding environment for an extended period of time. When muskellunge were exposed to VHSV IVb by immersion at a concentration of 1,400 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml, VHSV IVb was detected in the water of surviving fish for up to 15 weeks postexposure (p.e.) with the highest levels of shedding occurring between weeks 1 and 5 p.e. We estimated that each juvenile muskellunge can shed upwards of 1.36×10(5) PFU/fish/h after initial exposure signifying the uptake and amplification of VHSV to several orders of magnitude above the original exposure concentration. Muskellunge surviving low concentration exposure were re-infected with VHSV IVb by immersion at week 22 p.e. at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10(6) PFU/ml. Viral shedding was detected in all re-exposed fish, including mock rechallenged controls up to 15 consecutive weeks. Rates of viral shedding were substantially higher following rechallenge in the first 5 weeks. The highest rate of viral shedding was approximately 4.6×10(6) PFU/fish/h and shedding did not necessarily correspond to the re-exposure VHSV concentration. The results of this study shed new light into the dynamics of VHSV IVb shedding in a highly susceptible host and provide useful insights to fishery managers to design effective control strategies to this deadly virus.",[],"['Robert K Kim', 'Mohamed Faisal']"
Susceptibility of Pacific herring to viral hemorrhagic septicemia is influenced by diet.,"Groups of specific-pathogen-free Pacific herring Clupea pallasii were highly susceptible to infection by viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV); however, the level of mortality was influenced by diet during the 40-71 d before, during, and after the first exposure to the virus. Cumulative mortality was highest among the herring maintained on an experimental soy-based pellet, intermediate among those maintained on a commercially available fish-meal-based pellet, and lowest among those maintained on a second commercially available fish-meal-based pellet containing beta-glucans. Additionally, the herring maintained on the experimental soy-based feed demonstrated less growth than those on the commercially available feeds.

Loop‑mediated Isothermal Amplification assay (LAMP) based detection of Pasteurella multocida in cases of haemorrhagic septicaemia and fowl cholera.,"Twenty two isolates of Pasteurella multocida were obtained from different tissues of dead birds and animals (cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goat) suspected of fowl cholera and haemorrhagic septicaemia. The isolates were confirmed as P. multocida by various biochemical tests and PM PCR. An attempt was made to standardize Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using newly designed primer sequences of KMT1 gene. Loop mediated isothermal amplification was conducted using 6 sets of primers at 65°C for 30 minutes and the result was confirmed by visual observation using SYBR green fluorescence dye as marker of positive reaction under UV transilluminator. On electrophoretic analysis of the products on 2% agarose gel, a ladder like pattern was observed, which suggested a positive amplification, whereas no amplification was observed in negative controls. Additionally, product of positive reaction yielded a green fluorescence following addition of SYBR green under UV transilluminator. It was observed that LAMP is a more sensitive test than polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as the former could detect DNA to lower limit of 22.8 pg/µl, while the latter could detect DNA to lower limit of 2.28 ng/ µl, thus LAMP could detect 100 times lesser concentration of DNA in comparison to PCR. Loop mediated isothermal amplification is a rather newer molecular technique, which can be used for rapid detection of infectious agent at field level and which does not require sophisticated instrument, i.e. thermal cycler. Furthermore, unlike the conventional PCR technique, LAMP requires lesser time to perform and result can be read visually. ",[],"['Mayurkumar Bhimani', 'Bharat Bhanderi', 'Ashish Roy']"
Immune responses to haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) vaccination in Trypanosoma evansi infected buffalo-calves.,"To assess the immunosuppressive effect of Trypanosoma evansi infection in buffalo-calves on immune responses to heterologous antigen, the study was planned to examine the responses of haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccination in simultaneously and previously (80 days before vaccination) T. evansi-infected buffalo-calves. Eight buffalo-calves were divided into three groups. Buffalo-calves of group A (n = 3) were previously (80 days before primary vaccination with haemorrhagic septicaemia [HS] vaccine) infected with T. evansi (1 x 10(7) tryps.calf(-1); sc) and that of group B (n = 3) were infected with T. evansi (1 x 10(7) tryps.calf(-1); sc) on the day of primary vaccination with HS vaccine.

"Susceptibility of goldsinny wrasse, Ctenolabrus rupestris L. (Labridae), to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype III: Experimental challenge and pathology.","Cleaner fish, such as wrasse, are being increasingly used to combat the sea lice infestation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in many European countries. To determine susceptibility of the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris L.) and pathogenesis of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype III isolate 12-654, previously associated with VHSV infection in the Shetland Islands in 2012, fish were experimentally challenged by intraperitoneal injection (IP), bath immersion and cohabitation routes. Cumulative proportion of moribund wrasse reached 17% following the virus immersion challenge while by the IP-route moribunds exceeded 50% within 14days post-challenge. Typical signs of VHS as reported in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), were not observed in moribund goldsinny wrasse. The most pronounced histopathological changes, consistent regardless of the route of infection, were observed within the heart and included atrium myofibril degeneration, focal infiltration and multifocal necrosis, with prominent swelling of the endocardium and occasional detachment. Pathological changes in the atrium were associated with presence of the viral antigen as confirmed by a positive immunohistochemical staining. Virus clearance and heart tissue recovery were noted although further experiments are required to confirm these observations. The results of a cohabitation experiment confirmed that goldsinny wrasse shed viable virus and therefore represent a risk of virus transmission to other VHSV susceptible species. Similarities between the pathology in goldsinny wrasse induced through the controlled experimental challenges and that of wrasse spp. from an infection occurrence in Shetland are discussed.

Comparison of quantitative RT-PCR with cell culture to detect viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) IVb infections in the Great Lakes.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is an important pathogen of cultured and wild fish in marine and freshwater environments. A new genotype, VHSV IVb, was isolated from a fish collected from the Great Lakes in 2003. Since the first isolation, VHSV IVb has been confirmed in 28 species, signaling the early invasion and continued spread of this Office International des Epizooties-reportable agent. For surveillance of this virus in both wild and experimental settings, we have developed a rapid and sensitive one-step quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay that amplifies a 100-base-pair conserved segment from both the genomic negative strand and the mRNA positive strand of the nucleoprotein (N) gene of VHSV IVb. This assay is linear over seven orders of magnitude, with an analytical capability of detecting a single copy of viral RNA and reproducibility at 100 copies. The assay is approximately linear with RNA input from 50 to 1000 ng per assay and works equally well with RNA prepared from a column-based or phenol-chloroform-based method. In wild-caught fish, 97% of the cases were found to be more than three orders of magnitude more sensitive using qRT-PCR than using cell culture. Of the 1,428 fish from the Great Lakes region tested in 2006 and 2007, 24% were positive by qRT-PCR whereas only 5% were positive by cell culture. All of the fish that were positive by cell culture were also positive by qRT-PCR. Importantly, qRT-PCR sensitivity is comparable to that of cell culture detection when comparing VHSV viral RNA levels with viral titer stocks, confirming that the high qRT-PCR signals obtained with diagnostic samples are due to the accumulation of N gene mRNA by transcriptional attenuation. The qRT-PCR assay is particularly valuable for rapid and high-throughput prescreening of fish before confirmatory testing by cell culture or sequencing tissue-derived amplicons and especially in detecting infection in fish that do not show clinical signs of VHS.",[],"['Kristine M Hope', 'Rufina N Casey', 'Geoffrey H Groocock', 'Rodman G Getchell', 'Paul R Bowser', 'James W Casey']"
"Epidemiological features and financial loss due to clinically diagnosed Haemorrhagic Septicemia in bovines in Karnataka, India.","The epidemiological features and financial losses due to Haemorrhagic Septicemia (HS) in bovines were studied in Karnataka state using the primary data collected from 133 clinically diagnosed HS affected farms. The various losses due to HS and the Benefit- Cost of the vaccination programme in cattle and water buffaloes were studied using mathematical models. The number of HS outbreaks were higher during the year 2002 and peaked during 2005 and thereafter declined due to targeted vaccination against HS. The morbidity and mortality risks were lower in large farms than medium and small farms, and lower in indigenous cattle compared to high yielding crossbred cattle and water buffaloes. The disease occurrence was more in in-milk animals causing serious economic loss to the farmers. Most outbreaks were observed during monsoon season, though the disease was prevalent throughout the year. The mean milk loss per animal was $2, $11 and $50 in indigenous cattle, water buffaloes and crossbred cattle, respectively. In the case of draught animals, the average effective draught power was unavailable for 1.2days/outbreak resulting in a loss of $5 per affected oxen. The treatment and extra labor expenses incurred per animal were $24 and $7, respectively. The average loss per animal due to mortality loss was $275, $284 and $415 in case of indigenous cattle, water buffaloes and crossbred cattle, respectively. The projected loss for the state of Karnataka were $23.89, $17.92 and $11.95 million under high, medium and low HS incidence scenarios, respectively. The Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) of the vaccination against HS has been estimated at 5.97:1, 4.48:1 and 2.98:1 under high, medium and low incidence scenarios, respectively. The results highlight the important epidemiological features and financial losses to the affected households and the state of Karnataka.","['Case fatality', 'Endemicity', 'Financial loss', 'Haemorrhagic Septicemia', 'Morbidity', 'Mortality']","['G Govindaraj', 'P Krishnamoorthy', 'K R Nethrayini', 'R Shalini', 'H Rahman']"
Optimization of fixed-permeabilized cell monolayers for high throughput micro-neutralizing antibody assays: application to the zebrafish/viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (vhsv) model.,"A new high throughput centrifugation-free method to estimate viral neutralizing antibody levels in low volumes and large numbers of plasma blood samples is described. Cell monolayers were, (i) plated on poly-d-Lys coated 96-wells, (ii) infected with viruses previously incubated with fish plasma containing antibodies, (iii) fixed with formaldehyde to increase cell recovery and avoid centrifugation steps, (iv) permeabilized with Saponin, (v) immunostained in the presence of Saponin by using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to viral protein, (vi) digested with trypsin to detach cells from the monolayer, in the absence of Saponin to reduce damage of intracellular MAb-antigen complexes, and (vii) gated by flow cytometry using automatic 96-well batch analysis. The method was applied to the determination of plasma neutralizing antibodies from zebrafish (Danio rerio) surviving infections with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) (an important rhabdovirus of salmonids). This semi-automatic, rapid and practical assay detected anti-VHSV neutralizing antibodies in the plasma (∼3 μl per fish) of 95.1% of the zebrafish surviving VHSV infections. The fixed-permeabilized monolayer (FIXPERM) micro-neutralization method might help to analyze sera/plasma from small fish under standarized high throughput conditions.","['Assay', 'Fixed-permeabilized monolayers', 'Highthroughput', 'Neutralizing antibodies', 'VHSV', 'Zebrafish']","['Blanca Chinchilla', 'Paloma Encinas', 'Amparo Estepa', 'Julio Coll', 'Eduardo Gomez-Casado']"
Generation and characterization of NV gene-knockout recombinant viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVa.,"A recombinant viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (rVHSV-deltaNV-EGFP) containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene instead of the NV gene was produced using the reverse-genetics method. For use as a positive control, another recombinant virus (rVHSV-wild) was also generated, which had an identical nucleotide sequence to the wild-type VHSV genome except for a few artificially replaced nucleotides. The rVHSVs were rescued using a system controlled by T7 RNA polymerase supplied by a retroviral vector. Generation of rVHSV-deltaNV-EGFP and rVHSV-wild was confirmed by sequencing of RT-PCR products, and rescue of infectious rVHSVs was confirmed by observation of plaque formation. Replication efficiency of rVHSV-wild was distinctly lower than that of wild-type VHSV, suggesting that the artificially replaced nucleotides, especially when immediately preceding the G or NV gene start codons, might affect the replication of the virus. Replication of rVHSV-deltaNV-EGFP was slightly lower than that of rVHSV-wild when epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells were infected with multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1.0, but much lower when cells were infected with MOI 0.00001. These results suggest that the NV gene plays an important role in VHSV replication through interactions with host-cell responses, and the lower replication ability of rVHSV-wild compared to wild-type VHSV might be caused by replaced nucleotides just before the NV gene open reading frame (ORF) rather than the G gene ORF. In olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus, rVHSV-wild produced slower-progressing mortalities than wild-type VHSV, whereas rVHSV-deltaNV-EGFP pathogenesis was highly attenuated. These results suggest that the NV protein of VHSV may play an important role not only in viral replication but also in viral pathogenesis.",[],"['Min Sun Kim', 'Dong Soo Kim', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
Outbreak of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) in lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) in Iceland caused by VHS virus genotype IV.,"A novel viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) of genotype IV was isolated from wild lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus), brought to a land-based farm in Iceland, to serve as broodfish. Two groups of lumpfish juveniles, kept in tanks in the same facility, got infected. The virus isolated was identified as VHSV by ELISA and real-time RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the glycoprotein (G) gene sequences, may indicate a novel subgroup of VHSV genotype IV. In controlled laboratory exposure studies with this new isolate, there was 3% survival in the I.P. injection challenged group while there was 90% survival in the immersion group. VHSV was not re-isolated from fish challenged by immersion. In a cohabitation trial, lumpfish infected I.P. (shedders) were placed in tanks with naïve lumpfish as well as naïve Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). 10% of the lumpfish shedders and 43%-50% of the cohabiting lumpfish survived after 4 weeks. 80%-92% of the Atlantic salmon survived, but no viral RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR nor VHSV was isolated from Atlantic salmon. This is the first isolation of a notifiable virus in Iceland and the first report of VHSV of genotype IV in European waters.","['Iceland', 'challenge models', 'genotype IV', 'lumpfish', 'viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV)']","['Sigríður Guðmundsdóttir', 'Niccoló Vendramin', 'Argelia Cuenca', 'Heiða Sigurðardóttir', 'Arni Kristmundsson', 'Tine Moesgaard Iburg', 'Niels Jørgen Olesen']"

Efficacy of intranasal vaccination of field buffaloes against haemorrhagic septicaemia with a live gdhA derivative Pasteurella multocida B:2.,"The efficacy of an intranasal haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccine containing live gdhA derivative Pasteurella multocida B:2 was tested in buffaloes in Sabah. Sixty buffaloes, kept grazing in the field with minimal human intervention were devided into three groups of 20 buffaloes per group. Buffaloes of group 1 were exposed intranasal to 5 ml vaccine containing 10(6) CFU/ml of live gdhA derivative P multocida B:2. Buffaloes of group 2 were not exposed to the vaccine but exposed to PBS and were allowed to commingle and graze in the same field as the buffaloes of group 1 while buffaloes of group 3 were similarly exposed to PBS and were grazing separately. Booster was on group 1, two weeks later. Twelve months after the first vaccination, three buffaloes from each group were brought into the experimental house and challenged subcutaneously with 10(9) CFU/ml of live wild-type P multocida B:2. All challenged buffaloes of groups 1 and 2 survived with only mild, transient signs while all control unvaccinated buffaloes developed severe signs of haemorrhagic septicaemia and were euthanased between 28 hours and 38 hours postchallenge with signs and lesions typical of haemorrhagic septicaemia. These data showed that the gdhA mutant strain, given intranasally as two doses two weeks apart, successfully induced systemic immunity in exposed buffaloes and also led to spread of vaccine strain to the in-contact animals, where it acted as an effective live vaccine to protect both exposed buffaloes and in-contact buffaloes against challenge with the virulent parent strain.",[],"['O Rafidah', 'M Zamri-Saad', 'S Shahirudin', 'E Nasip']"
Cell-mediated immune responses in rainbow trout after DNA immunization against the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus.,"To identify viral proteins that induce cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)-infected cells, rainbow trout were immunized with DNA vectors encoding the glycoprotein G or the nucleocapsid protein N of VHSV. The G protein was a more potent trigger of cytotoxic cells than the N protein. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) isolated from trout immunized against the G protein killed both VHSV-infected MHC class I matched (RTG-2) and VHSV-infected xenogeneic (EPC) target cells, suggesting the involvement of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and NK cells, respectively. In contrast, PBL from trout that were immunized against the N protein only killed VHSV-infected RTG-2 cells, indicating that this protein only elicits a CTL response. Further, a significant killing capacity of these PBL was only observed during summer months. PBL from fish that were immunized against the VHSV G protein significantly killed VHSV-infected but not infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV)-infected targets indicating antigen specificity. Thus, this is the first report on cytotoxic immune responses after DNA vaccination in fish. Furthermore, cells isolated from the inflamed site of DNA injection were stained and transferred to isogeneic DNA-vaccinated recipients. Most of the stained donor leukocytes accumulated at the recipients' DNA injection site showing, for the first time, leukocyte homing in fish. Transferred donor leukocytes mainly migrated to the homologous vaccine injection site rather than to injection sites of heterologous vaccines, suggesting the antigen specificity of homing. By demonstrating CMC responses to distinct viral proteins and homing in rainbow trout, these results substantially contribute to the understanding of the teleost immune system.",[],"['Katrin Utke', 'Holger Kock', 'Heike Schuetze', 'Sven M Bergmann', 'Niels Lorenzen', 'Katja Einer-Jensen', 'Bernd Köllner', 'Roy A Dalmo', 'Tomas Vesely', 'Mitsuru Ototake', 'Uwe Fischer']"
The role of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) NV gene in TNF-α- and VHSV infection-mediated NF-κB activation.,"The role of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) NV gene in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation was investigated. Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells pre-treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α showed a strong resistance against VHSV infection, but cells treated with TNF-α after VHSV infection showed no resistance, suggesting that immediate early TNF-α-mediated responses inhibit VHSV replication. Activation of NF-κB is a key step in TNF-α-mediated immunomodulatory pathways. In this study, activation of NF-κB by TNF-α exposure was inhibited in EPC cells harboring NV gene expressing vectors, indicating that the NV gene of VHSV can suppress TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. Furthermore, the NV gene knock-out recombinant VHSV (rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP) induced significantly higher NF-κB activity in EPC cells than wild-type VHSV, suggesting that VHSV adopted a strategy to suppress early activation of NF-κB in host cells through and NV gene.",[],"['Min Sun Kim', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
[Preparation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus].,"To prepare the monoclonal antibody (mAb) against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and analyze the biological properties.The BALB/c mice were immunized with the VHSV which was purified by differential centrifugation. Spleen cells of the immune mice were collected and fused with Sp2/0 myeloma cells by hybridoma technology. The indirect ELISA was used to screen hyridoma cells and identify the specificity of mAb. The Western blotting was used to identify antigen site.After three cycle of subcloning with limited dilution method, we obtained a cell strain that secreted mAb against VHSV and was named 4A5. The indirect ELISA showed that the titer of mAb ascites was 10⁻⁴;. It belonged to IgG3 subclass κ chain and couldn't react with other fish viruses or fish cell lines in the ELISA except VHSV. Western blotting revealed that mAb 4A5 bound to a 70 kDa of protein band of VHSV as antigen.The obtained mAb has a high specificity, which could be used for rapid diagnosis and detection of VHSV in aquaculture.",[],"['Hongli Jing', 'Jingbo Wang', 'Huan Cao', 'Xiangmei Lin']"
A new StaRT-PCR approach to detect and quantify fish Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSv): enhanced quality control with internal standards.,"Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSv) causes one of the world's most important finfish diseases, killing >80 species across Eurasia and North America. A new and especially virulent strain (IVb) emerged in the North American Great Lakes in 2003, threatening fisheries, baitfish, and aquaculture industries. Weeks-long and costly cell culture is the OIE and USDA-APHIS approved diagnostic. A new Standardized Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (StaRT-PCR) assay that uniquely incorporates internal standards to improve accuracy and prevent false negatives was developed and evaluated for its ability to detect and quantify VHSv. Results from StaRT-PCR, SYBR(®) green real time qRT-PCR, and cell culture were compared, as well as the effects of potential PCR inhibitors (EDTA and high RNA). Findings show that StaRT-PCR is sensitive, detecting a single molecule, with 100% accuracy at six molecules, and had no false negatives. In comparison, false negatives ranged from 14 to 47% in SYBR(®) green real time qRT-PCR tests, and 47-70% with cell culture. StaRT-PCR uniquely controlled for EDTA and RNA interference. Range of VHSv quantitation by StaRT-PCR was 1.0×10(0)-1.2×10(5) VHSv/10(6)actb1 molecules in wild caught fishes and 1.0×10(0)-8.4×10(5) molecules in laboratory challenged specimens. In the latter experiments, muskellunge with skin lesions had significantly more viral molecules (mean=1.9×10(4)) than those without (1.1×10(3)) (p<0.04). VHSv infection was detected earlier in injection than in immersion challenged yellow perch (two versus three days), with molecule numbers in both being comparable and relatively consistent over the remaining course of the experiment. Our results show that the StaRT-PCR test accurately and reliably detects and quantifies VHSv.",[],"['Lindsey R Pierce', 'James C Willey', 'Erin L Crawford', 'Vrushalee V Palsule', 'Douglas W Leaman', 'Mohamed Faisal', 'Robert K Kim', 'Brian S Shepherd', 'Lauren M Stanoszek', 'Carol A Stepien']"
Inter-species transmission of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) from turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) to rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss).,"Successful viral infection is a complex mechanism, involving many host-pathogen interactions that developed during coevolution of host and pathogen, and often result in host-species specificity. Nevertheless, many viruses are able to infect several host species and sporadically cross species barriers. The viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), a rhabdovirus with high economic impact on the aquaculture industry, has developed an exceptionally wide host range across marine and freshwater environments. Transmission of VHSV between host species therefore represents a potential risk for aquaculture, which currently is not addressed in biosecurity managements. The objective of this study was to investigate the inter-species transmission potential of VHSV and evaluate whether infected marine wild fish pose a potential risk on marine cultured rainbow trout. A cohabitation infection trial with turbot as donor and rainbow trout as recipient host species was conducted. Turbot were intraperitoneally injected with either a marine-adapted (MA) or a trout-adapted (TA) VHSV isolate and subsequently grouped with naïve rainbow trout. Both VHSV isolates were able to replicate and cause mortality in turbot, while only the TA isolate was able to cross the species barrier and infect rainbow trout with fatal outcome. The results demonstrate that a marine fish species can function as reservoir and transmitter of TA VHSV isolates.",[],"['Anna A Schönherz', 'Niels Lorenzen', 'Katja Einer-Jensen']"
Fin and gill biopsies are effective nonlethal samples for detection of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus genotype IVb.,"Nonlethal sampling is becoming a common method to diagnose fish diseases, especially with the availability of molecular testing. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a viral pathogen of finfish distributed worldwide. Although VHSV has been known to occur in some parts of the world for decades, a new genotype, IVb, recently emerged in the Laurentian Great Lakes of northeastern North America. Golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas; Mitchill, 1814) and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas; Rafinesque, 1820) were exposed to VHSV-IVb doses between 10(2) and 10(6) plaque forming units per fish by intraperitoneal injection at 10°C. Both species experienced significant mortality after exposure, ranging from 38% to 52% in golden shiners and from 35% to 95% in fathead minnows. In golden shiners, a fin or gill sample was somewhat less sensitive at detecting VHSV-IVb by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) than a pooled organ sample (consisting of liver, anterior and posterior kidney, spleen, and heart), however the relative sensitivity increased when a fin and gill sample were tested in parallel. In fathead minnows, a fin or gill sample tested alone or in parallel was relatively more sensitive than a pooled organ sample by qRT-PCR. Specificity was 100% for all sample types in both species. The results suggest that fin and gill biopsies are useful tools to test for VHSV in live fish.",[],"['Emily R Cornwell', 'Chelsea A Bellmund', 'Geoffrey H Groocock', 'Po Ting Wong', 'Katherine L Hambury', 'Rodman G Getchell', 'Paul R Bowser']"
Inhibition of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus replication using a short hairpin RNA targeting the G gene.,"RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism for post-transcriptional silencing of homologous genes by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), has emerged as an antiviral strategy in animals. In this study, the epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cell line, in combination with a fugu-U6-promoter-driven shRNA construct designed against G gene, was used to investigate whether short hairpin RNA (shRNA) could inhibit viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) proliferation by sequence-specific RNAi. The results showed that transfection with a shRNA-producing construct (shRNA-VG594) resulted in a sequence-specific knockdown of G gene mRNA in EPC cells. There were no significant differences in IFN-induced Mx1 gene expression among cells transfected with each shRNA vector including shRNA-VG594, -VG594sc (two nucleotides mismatch) and -EGFP (non-specific control), suggesting that knockdown of G gene expression was not due to an IFN response but instead by sequence-specific RNAi. Transfection of EPC cells with shRNA-VG594 conferred resistance to VHSV, and this anti-VHSV effect was not observed when using a two-nucleotide-mismatched shRNA-VG594sc or a shRNA targeting EGFP. Furthermore, shRNA-VG594 expressed in EPC cells did not confer protection against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), suggesting sequence-specific RNAi-dependent suppression of viral replication.",[],"['Min Sun Kim', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
Comparison of treatments to inactivate viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV-IVb) in frozen baitfish.,"Current US state and federal fish health regulations target the spread of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus-IVb (VHSV-IVb) through movement restrictions of live fish; however, they largely ignore the potential for the virus to be spread through commercial distribution and use of frozen baitfish from VHSV-IVb-positive regions. Some state laws do require treatment of frozen baitfish to inactivate VHSV, and additional methods have been proposed, but few scientific studies have examined the efficacy of these treatments. In this study, bluegills Lepomis macrochirus were challenged with VHSV-IVb and frozen to represent standard industry methods, disinfected by various treatments, and tested for infectious VHSV-IVb using virus isolation. The virus was isolated from 70% of fish subjected to 3 freeze/thaw cycles. All other treatment methods were effective in inactivating the virus, including treatment with isopropyl alcohol, mineral oil, salt and borax, and dehydration. Dehydration followed by rehydration is rapid and effective, and therefore, seems to be the best option for inactivating VHSV-IVb present in frozen baitfish while maintaining their usefulness as bait.",[],"['Nicholas B D Phelps', 'Andrew E Goodwin', 'Emily Marecaux', 'Sagar M Goyal']"

The use of a one-step real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for the surveillance of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in Minnesota.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a highly contagious and pathogenic virus of fish. The virus infects more than 70 fish species worldwide, in both fresh and salt water. A new viral strain (VHSV-IVb) has proven both virulent and persistent, spreading throughout the Great Lakes of North America and to inland water bodies in the region. To better understand the geographic distribution of the virus, we used a modified real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay for high-throughput testing of fish for VHSV. The assay was shown to be twice as sensitive as the gold standard, virus isolation, and did not cross react with other viruses found in fish. In addition, the diagnostic turnaround time was reduced from 28 to 30 d for virus isolation to 2-4 d for rRT-PCR. To demonstrate the usefulness of the rRT-PCR assay, 115 high-priority water bodies in Minnesota were tested by both methods from April 2010 to June 2011. All survey sites tested negative for VHSV by both methods. The survey results have informed fisheries managers on the absence of VHSV in Minnesota and have better prepared them for the eventual arrival of the disease. In addition, the results demonstrate the value of this rRT-PCR as a surveillance tool to rapidly identify an outbreak so that it can be controlled in a timely manner.",[],"['Nicholas B D Phelps', 'Devi P Patnayak', 'Yin Jiang', 'Sagar M Goyal']"
Typing of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus by monoclonal antibodies.,"Seven mAbs with specific reaction patterns against each of the four genotypes and eight subtypes of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) were produced, aiming to establish an immunoassay for typing VHSV isolates according to their genotype. Among the mAbs, VHS-1.24 reacted with all genotypes except genotype Ie, whilst mAb VHS-9.23 reacted with all genotypes except genotype III. mAb VHS-3.80 reacted with genotypes Ib, Ic, Id and II. mAb VHS-7.57 reacted with genotypes II and IVa, and mAb VHS-5.18 with genotype Ib only. Interestingly, mAb VHS-3.75 reacted with all of the genotype III isolates except a rainbow trout-pathogenic isolate from the west coast of Norway, and reacted in addition with the IVb isolate, CA-NB00-01, from the east coast of the USA. Finally, mAb VHS-1.88 reacted with all genotype IVb isolates from the Great Lakes, but not with CA-NB00-01. In conclusion, we can distinguish between all four genotypes and between five of eight subtypes of VHSV by testing isolates in immunoassay using a panel of nine mAbs. By Western blotting and transfection of cell cultures, it was shown that mAb VHS-1.24 recognized an epitope on the viral phosphoprotein (P), whilst all others recognized antigenic determinants on the nucleoprotein (N). From amino acid alignments of the various genotypes and subtypes of VHSV isolates, it was possible to determine the epitope specificity of mAb VHS-1.24 to be aa 32-34 in the P-protein; the specificities of mAbs VHS-3.80, VHS-7.57 and VHS-3.75 were found to be aa 43 and 45-48, aa 117 and 121, and aa 103, 118 and 121 of the N-protein, respectively.",[],"['Takafumi Ito', 'Jun Kurita', 'Motohiko Sano', 'Helle Frank Skall', 'Niels Lorenzen', 'Katja Einer-Jensen', 'Niels Jørgen Olesen']"
cDNA microarray analysis of disk abalone genes in gills and hemocytes after viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) challenge.,"A disk abalone Haliotis discus discus 4.2 K cDNA microarray was designed by selecting abalone expressed sequence tags (ESTs).

Among the 4188 genes analyzed, 280 (6.6%) transcripts were changed their expression level in gills and hemocytes against VHSV challenge compared to control animals. Total of 88 and 65 genes were up-regulated in gills and hemocytes, respectively. These genes can be grouped under various immune-functional categories such as transcription factors (Krüppell-like factor; ETS-family transcription factor), inflammatory and apoptosis related genes (TNF superfamily members, Fas ligand), IFN regulatory proteins (IFN-44 like, interferon gamma-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase) and detoxification proteins (glutathione peroxidase). In contrast, 25 and 102 genes were shown down-regulation in gills and hemocytes, respectively.

Evolution and biogeography of an emerging quasispecies: diversity patterns of the fish Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSv).,"Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSv) is an RNA rhabdovirus that causes one of the most important finfish diseases, affecting over 70 marine and freshwater species. It was discovered in European cultured fish in 1938 and since has been described across the Northern Hemisphere. Four strains and several substrains have been hypothesized, whose phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary radiation are evaluated here in light of a quasispecies model, including an in-depth analysis of the novel and especially virulent new substrain (IVb) that first appeared in the North American Laurentian Great Lakes in 2003. We analyze the evolutionary patterns, genetic diversity, and biogeography of VHSv using all available RNA sequences from the glycoprotein (G), nucleoprotein (N), and non-virion (Nv) genes, with Maximum Likelihood and bayesian approaches. Results indicate that the G gene evolves at an estimated rate of μ=2.58×10(-4) nucleotide substitutions per site per year, the N gene at μ=4.26×10(-4), and Nv fastest at μ=1.25×10(-3). Phylogenetic trees from the three genes largely are congruent, distinguishing strains I-IV as reciprocally monophyletic with high bootstrap and posterior probability support. VHSv appears to have originated from a marine ancestor in the North Atlantic Ocean, diverging into two primary clades: strain IV in North America (the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean), and strains I-III in the Northeastern Atlantic region (Europe). Strain II may comprise the basal group of the latter clade and diverged in Baltic Sea estuarine waters; strains I and III appear to be sister groups (according to the G and Nv genes), with the former mostly in European freshwaters and the latter in North Sea marine/estuarine waters. Strain IV is differentiated into three monophyletic substrains, with IVa infecting Northeastern Pacific salmonids and many marine fishes (with 44 unique G gene haplotypes), IVb endemic to the freshwater Great Lakes (11 haplotypes), and a newly-designated IVc in marine/estuarine North Atlantic waters (five haplotypes). Two separate substrains independently appeared in the Northwestern Pacific region (Asia) in 1996, with Ib originating from the west and IVa from the east. Our results depict an evolutionary history of relatively rapid population diversifications in star-like patterns, following a quasispecies model. This study provides a baseline for future tracking of VHSv spread and interpreting its evolutionary diversification pathways.",[],"['Lindsey R Pierce', 'Carol A Stepien']"
"Heterogeneity in levels of serum neutralizing antibodies against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus genotype IVB among fish species in Lake St. Clair, Michigan, USA.","The presence of neutralizing antibodies against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV-IVb) was investigated in sera of 13 fish species collected from Lake St. Clair, Michigan, USA, a VHSV-endemic water body. We tested 297 sera collected May 2004-June of 2010, using a complement-dependent 50% plaque neutralization test (50% PNT). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 23% (67/297) of the samples.

It has caused extensive losses of cultured and wild fish and has become established in the North American Great Lakes. Large die-offs of wild fish in the Great Lakes due to VHSV have alarmed the public and provoked government attention on the introduction and spread of aquatic animal pathogens in freshwaters. We investigated the relations between VHSV dispersion and shipping and boating activity in the Great Lakes by sampling fish and water at sites that were commercial shipping harbors, recreational boating centers, and open shorelines. Fish and water samples were individually analyzed for VHSV using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and cell culture assays. Of 1,221 fish of 17 species, 55 were VHSV positive with highly varied qRT-PCR titers (1 to 5,950,000 N gene copies). The detections of VHSV in fish and water samples were closely associated and the virus was detected in 21 of 30 sites sampled. The occurrence of VHSV was not related to type of site or shipping related invasion hotspots. Our results indicate that VHSV is widely dispersed in the Great Lakes and is both an enzootic and epizootic pathogen. We demonstrate that pathogen distribution information could be developed quickly and is clearly needed for aquatic ecosystem conservation, management of affected populations, and informed regulation of the worldwide trade of aquatic organisms.",[],"['Mark B Bain', 'Emily R Cornwell', 'Kristine M Hope', 'Geofrey E Eckerlin', 'Rufina N Casey', 'Geoffrey H Groocock', 'Rodman G Getchell', 'Paul R Bowser', 'James R Winton', 'William N Batts', 'Allegra Cangelosi', 'James W Casey']"
Susceptibility of three stocks of pacific herring to viral hemorrhagic septicemia.,"Laboratory challenges using specific-pathogen-free Pacific herring Clupea pallasii from three distinct populations indicated that stock origin had no effect on susceptibility to viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). All of the populations were highly susceptible to the disease upon initial exposure, with significantly greater cumulative mortalities occurring in the exposed treatment groups (56.3-64.3%) than in the unexposed control groups (0.8-9.0%). Interstock differences in cumulative mortality were not significant. The virus loads in the tissues of fish experiencing mortality were 10-10,000 times higher during the acute phase of the epizootics (day 13 postexposure) than during the recovery phase (days 30-42). Survivors of the epizootics were refractory to subsequent VHS, with reexposure of VHS survivors resulting in significantly less cumulative mortality (1.2-4.0%) than among positive controls (38.1-64.4%); interstock differences in susceptibility did not occur after reexposure. These results indicate that data from experiments designed to understand the ecology of VHS virus in a given stock of Pacific herring are broadly applicable to stocks throughout the northeastern Pacific.",[],"['P K Hershberger', 'J L Gregg', 'C A Grady', 'R M Collins', 'J R Winton']"
Time-course study of the protection induced by an interferon-inducible DNA vaccine against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia in rainbow trout.,"The highly effective DNA vaccines against diseases caused by fish rhabdoviruses in farmed fish consist of a DNA plasmid vector encoding the viral glycoprotein under the control of a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV). Among others, attempts to improve efficacy and safety of these DNA vaccines have focused on regulatory elements of plasmid vectors, which play a major role in controlling expression levels of vaccine antigens. Depending on the context, use of a fish-derived promoter with minimal activity in mammalian cells could be preferable. Another aspect related to the CMV promoter is that constitutive expression of the vaccine antigen may lead to rapid elimination of antigen expressing cells in the fish and thereby potentially reduce the long-term effects of the vaccine. In this study, we compared DNA vaccines with the interferon-inducible Mx promoter from rainbow trout and the CMV promoter, respectively. Plasmid constructs encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were used for the in vitro analysis, whereas DNA vaccines encoding the glycoprotein (G) of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) were applied for the in vivo examination. The in vitro analysis showed that while the DNA vaccine with the CMV promoter constitutively drove the expression of EGFP in both fish and human cell lines, the DNA vaccine with the Mx promoter inducibly enhanced the expression of EGFP in the fish cell line. To address the impact on protection, a time-course model was followed as suggested by Kurath et al. (2006), where vaccinated fish were challenged with VHSV at 2, 8 and 78 weeks post-vaccination (wpv). The DNA vaccine with the CMV promoter protected at all times, while vaccination with the DNA vaccine containing the Mx promoter only protected the fish at 8 wpv. However, following induction with Poly (I:C) one week before the challenge, high protection was also evident at 2 wpv. In conclusion, the results revealed a more fish host dependent activity of the trout Mx promoter compared to the traditionally used cross species-active CMV promoter, but improvements will be needed for its application in DNA vaccines to ensure long term protection.","['Antiviral responses', 'CMV', 'DNA vaccines', 'Mx', 'Promoter', 'Rainbow trout', 'VHS', 'VHSV', 'Viral haemorragic seticaemia virus']","['Dagoberto Sepúlveda', 'Ellen Lorenzen', 'Jesper Skou Rasmussen', 'Katja Einer-Jensen', 'Bertrand Collet', 'C J Secombes', 'Niels Lorenzen']"
Detection of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from two fish species at two sites in Lake Superior.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was first detected in the Laurentian Great Lakes in 2005 during a mortality event in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario. Subsequent analysis of archived samples determined that the first known isolation of VHSV in the Laurentian Great Lakes was from a muskellunge Esox masquinongy collected in Lake St. Clair in 2003. By the end of 2008, mortality events and viral isolations had occurred in all of the Laurentian Great Lakes except Lake Superior. In 2009, a focused disease surveillance program was designed to determine whether VHSV was also present in Lake Superior. In this survey, 874 fish from 7 sites along the U.S. shoreline of Lake Superior were collected during June 2009. Collections were focused on nearshore species known to be susceptible to VHSV. All fish were dissected individually by using aseptic techniques and were tested for the presence of VHSV genetic material by use of a quantitative reverse transcription (qRT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the viral nucleoprotein gene. Seventeen fish from two host species at two different sites tested positive at low levels for VHSV. All attempts to isolate virus in cell culture were unsuccessful. However, the presence of viral RNA was confirmed independently in five fish by using a nested PCR that targeted the glycoprotein (G) gene. Partial G gene sequences obtained from three fish were identical to the corresponding sequence from the original 2003 VHSV isolate (MI03) from muskellunge. These detections represent the earliest evidence for the presence of VHSV in Lake Superior and illustrate the utility of the highly sensitive qRT-PCR assay for disease surveillance in aquatic animals.",[],"['Emily R Cornwell', 'Geofrey E Eckerlin', 'Rodman G Getchell', 'Geoffrey H Groocock', 'Tarin M Thompson', 'William N Batts', 'Rufina N Casey', 'Gael Kurath', 'James R Winton', 'Paul R Bowser', 'Mark B Bain', 'James W Casey']"
Clonality and virulence traits of Escherichia coli associated with haemorrhagic septicaemia in turkeys.,"Fifty-five clinical isolates of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) from seven outbreaks of acute haemorrhagic septicaemia in turkeys were characterized by serotyping, plasmid profiling including restriction analysis with HindIII, ribotyping with EcoRI and HindIII, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and virulence profiling. A clonal relationship was demonstrated for each outbreak according to serotype, plasmid profiling, ribotyping, and MLST. In addition, isolates demonstrated highly similar virulence profiles, as all isolates were positive for F11 pili and possessed genes encoding aerobactin (iucD), increased serum survival (iss), temperature-sensitive haemagglutinin (tsh) and colicin V plasmid operon genes (cva/cvi). However, only 20% of the isolates produced colicin V and 42% exhibited serum resistance. All strains with O group O111 and a single O18ac strain (demonstrating non-clonal DNA profiles) were positive for enteroaggregative heat-stabile toxin (EAST1), while isolates of a single outbreak all possessed the enteroaggregative toxin gene (astA). All isolates were negative for genes encoding verocytotoxins (vtx/stx), iron-repressible protein (irp2), P-fimbria (papC), invasion plasmid antigen (ipaH), attaching and effacing gene (eae), enterohaemolysin (ehxA), and enterotoxins LT, STIa (ST(p)) and STIb (ST(h)). In conclusion, highly similar virulence profiles were demonstrated for isolates of E. coli associated with a single well-defined lesion type of colibacillosis in turkeys; acute haemorrhagic septicaemia. The isolates obtained, however, demonstrated a different phylogenetic background, underlining the importance of using well-defined strain collections for characterization of APEC pathotypes.",[],"['R H Olsen', 'M S Chadfield', 'J P Christensen', 'F Scheutz', 'H Christensen', 'M Bisgaard']"
Live vaccine of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) for Japanese flounder at fish rearing temperature of 21°C instead of Poly(I:C) administration.,"The process of ""Poly(I:C) immunization"" involves immunization of fish with a pathogenic live virus, followed by administration of Poly(I:C), which induces a transient, non-specific antiviral state. As a result, fish in an antiviral state survive the initial immunization with live virus. Moreover, these fish are able to mount a specific protective immune response against the injected pathogenic virus. In the present study, we investigated the optimum temperature for Poly(I:C) immunization of Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus with live viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). It was revealed that the optimum temperature was around at 17°C for Poly(I:C) immunization in Japanese flounder. Furthermore, the protection efficacy of Poly(I:C) immunization was significantly decreased by elevation of fish rearing temperature, and no efficacy was observed at a fish rearing temperature of 25°C. Interestingly, no mortality by VHSV infection was observed in fish reared at 21°C and 25°C even when those fish were not administered Poly(I:C). All of the survivors from the first VHSV-challenge at 21°C were strongly protected from re-challenge with VHSV. However, almost all of the survivors (≥82.6%) from the first challenge at 25°C were lost by the second challenge with VHSV. It was thus concluded that by rearing fish at 21°C and challenging with live VHSV, it is possible to induce strong specific immunity in Japanese flounder without Poly(I:C) administration.",[],"['Toyohiko Nishizawa', 'Ikuo Takami', 'Minji Yang', 'Myung-Joo Oh']"
Suppression subtractive hybridization coupled with microarray analysis to examine differential expression of genes in Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus leucocytes during Edwardsiella tarda and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus infection.,"Transcriptional changes in the peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) of Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus challenged by Edwardsiella tarda and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) were investigated using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) coupled with cDNA microarray analysis. First, we constructed an SSH cDNA library using mRNA samples isolated from PBL of P. olivaceus that had been experimentally infected with E. tarda. We then examined the transcriptional changes occurring in the PBL due to E. tarda and VHSV infection using a cDNA microarray produced using clones produced from the SSH library. A total of 565 and 180 cDNA sequences corresponding to mRNA species that are either up- or down-regulated by E. tarda infection were isolated by SSH. While host gene expression responses in response to E. tarda and VHSV infection share several response elements, distinct patterns of gene expression were also observed. Specifically, E. tarda infection enhanced the expression of cell adhesion molecules while VHSV enhanced the expression of interferon and proteasome-related genes. In challenge trials of the two infectious agents, expression profiles of chemokines were also observed to differ. The results indicated that distinguishing between viral and bacterial infection is possible based on the RNA expression profiles of PBL from infected fish.",[],"['Tomomasa Matsuyama', 'Atushi Fujiwara', 'Tomokazu Takano', 'Chihaya Nakayasu']"
Effects of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) on the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) monocyte cell line RTS-11.,"The effect of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was studied on the established rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) monocyte/macrophage-like cell line RTS11. The virus was not able to complete its replication cycle as infectious viral particles were not released from the cells. However, in RTS11, the virus was capable of producing mRNA from at least its N and G genes. At the protein level, only N protein was detected 2 days post-infection, whereas a faint band corresponding to the G protein was also observed after 5 days post-infection. These results suggest an interruption of viral protein translation at some point. The expression of N mRNA was significantly inhibited in cells pre-treated with Poly I:C, but not affected by 2-aminopurine (2-AP), an inhibitor of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), thus indicating that PKR has no effect on mRNA expression directly. However, when cells were preincubated with Poly I:C in the presence of 2-AP, the levels of N mRNA were restored suggesting that Poly I:C can limit viral transcription through an antiviral mechanism dependent of PKR. The effect of VHSV on the expression of transcripts for different immune genes was determined, but significant induction was found only for genes related to the type I interferon (IFN) response, such as IFN-1 and -2 and the three Mx isoforms. Heat-inactivated virus failed to induce IFN-1 and -2, suggesting that early events in the VHSV life cycle were necessary for the type I IFN response. Poly I:C alone also induced transcripts for the antiviral Mx proteins. Prior exposure of RTS11 to VHSV did not prevent Poly I:C from inducing transcripts for Mx1, Mx2 and Mx3. Perhaps the failure of VHSV to disable antiviral mechanisms in RTS11 accounts for the aborted infections.",[],"['Carolina Tafalla', 'Esther Sanchez', 'Niels Lorenzen', 'Stephanie J DeWitte-Orr', 'Niels C Bols']"
"A retrospective study on the epidemiology of anthrax, foot and mouth disease, haemorrhagic septicaemia, peste des petits ruminants and rabies in Bangladesh, 2010-2012.","Anthrax, foot and mouth disease (FMD), haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and rabies are considered to be endemic in Bangladesh. This retrospective study was conducted to understand the geographic and seasonal distribution of these major infectious diseases in livestock based on data collected through passive surveillance from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012. Data analysis for this period revealed 5,937 cases of anthrax, 300,333 of FMD, 13,436 of HS, 247,783 of PPR and 14,085 cases of dog bite/rabies. While diseases were reported in almost every district of the country, the highest frequency of occurrence corresponded to the susceptible livestock population in the respective districts. There was no significant difference in the disease occurrences between districts bordering India/Myanmar and non-border districts (p>0.05). Significantly higher (p<0.01) numbers of anthrax (84.5%), FMD (88.3%), HS (84.9%) and dog bite/rabies (64.3%) cases were reported in cattle than any other species. PPR cases were reported mostly (94.8%) in goats with only isolated cases (5.2%) in sheep. The diseases occur throughout the year with peak numbers reported during June through September and lowest during December through April, with significant differences (p<0.01) between the months. The annual usages of vaccines for anthrax, FMD, HS and PPR were only 7.31%, 0.61%, 0.84% and 11.59% of the susceptible livestock population, respectively. Prophylactic vaccination against rabies was 21.16% of cases. There were significant differences (p<0.01) in the administration of anthrax, FMD and HS vaccines between border and non-border districts, but not PPR or rabies vaccines. We recommend that surveillance and reporting of these diseases need to be improved throughout the country. Furthermore, all suspected clinical cases should be confirmed by laboratory examination. The findings of this study can be used in the formulation of more effective disease management and control strategies, including appropriate vaccination policies in Bangladesh.

Emergence of Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in the North American Great Lakes region is associated with low viral genetic diversity.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a fish rhabdovirus that causes disease in a broad range of marine and freshwater hosts. The known geographic range includes the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and recently it has invaded the Great Lakes region of North America. The goal of this work was to characterize genetic diversity of Great Lakes VHSV isolates at the early stage of this viral emergence by comparing a partial glycoprotein (G) gene sequence (669 nt) of 108 isolates collected from 2003 to 2009 from 31 species and at 37 sites. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all isolates fell into sub-lineage IVb within the major VHSV genetic group IV. Among these 108 isolates, genetic diversity was low, with a maximum of 1.05% within the 669 nt region. There were 11 unique sequences, designated vcG001 to vcG011. Two dominant sequence types, vcG001 and vcG002, accounted for 90% (97 of 108) of the isolates. The vcG001 isolates were most widespread. We saw no apparent association of sequence type with host or year of isolation, but we did note a spatial pattern, in which vcG002 isolates were more prevalent in the easternmost sub-regions, including inland New York state and the St. Lawrence Seaway. Different sequence types were found among isolates from single disease outbreaks, and mixtures of types were evident within 2 isolates from individual fish. Overall, the genetic diversity of VHSV in the Great Lakes region was found to be extremely low, consistent with an introduction of a new virus into a geographic region with previously naive host populations.",[],"['Tarin M Thompson', 'William N Batts', 'Mohamed Faisal', 'Paul Bowser', 'James W Casey', 'Kenneth Phillips', 'Kyle A Garver', 'James Winton', 'Gael Kurath']"
A reverse genetics system for the Great Lakes strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus: the NV gene is required for pathogenicity.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), belonging to the genus Novirhabdovirus in the family of Rhabdoviridae, causes a highly contagious disease of fresh and saltwater fish worldwide. Recently, a novel genotype of VHSV, designated IVb, has invaded the Great Lakes in North America, causing large-scale epidemics in wild fish. An efficient reverse genetics system was developed to generate a recombinant VHSV of genotype IVb from cloned cDNA. The recombinant VHSV (rVHSV) was comparable to the parental wild-type strain both in vitro and in vivo, causing high mortality in yellow perch (Perca flavescens). A modified recombinant VHSV was generated in which the NV gene was substituted with an enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP), and another recombinant was made by inserting the EGFP gene into the full-length viral clone between the P and M genes (rVHSV-EGFP). The in vitro replication kinetics of rVHSV-EGFP was similar to rVHSV; however, the rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP grew 2 logs lower. In yellow perch challenges, wtVHSV and rVHSV induced 82-100% cumulative per cent mortality (CPM), respectively, whereas rVHSV-EGFP produced 62% CPM and rVHSV-ΔNV-EGFP caused only 15% CPM. No reversion of mutation was detected in the recovered viruses and the recombinant viruses stably maintained the foreign gene after several passages. These results indicate that the NV gene of VHSV is not essential for viral replication in vitro and in vivo, but it plays an important role in viral replication efficiency and pathogenicity. This system will facilitate studies of VHSV replication, virulence, and production of viral vectored vaccines.",[],"['Arun Ammayappan', 'Gael Kurath', 'Tarin M Thompson', 'Vikram N Vakharia']"
"Dynamics of viral hemorrhagic septicemia, viral erythrocytic necrosis and ichthyophoniasis in confined juvenile Pacific herring Clupea pallasii.","Capture of wild, juvenile herring Clupea pallasii from Puget Sound (Washington, USA) and confinement in laboratory tanks resulted in outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), viral erythrocytic necrosis (VEN) and ichthyophoniasis; however, the timing and progression of the 3 diseases differed. The VHS epidemic occurred first, characterized by an initially low infection prevalence that increased quickly with confinement time, peaking at 93 to 98% after confinement for 6 d, then decreasing to negligible levels after 20 d. The VHS outbreak was followed by a VEN epidemic that, within 12 d of confinement, progressed from undetectable levels to 100% infection prevalence with >90% of erythrocytes demonstrating inclusions. The VEN epidemic persisted for 54 d, after which the study was terminated, and was characterized by severe blood dyscrasias including reduction of mean hematocrit from 42 to 6% and replacement of mature erythrocytes with circulating erythroblasts and ghost cells. All fish with ichthyophoniasis at capture died within the first 3 wk of confinement, probably as a result of the multiple stressors associated with capture, transport, confinement, and progression of concomitant viral diseases. The results illustrate the differences in disease ecology and possible synergistic effects of pathogens affecting marine fish and highlight the difficulty in ascribing a single causation to outbreaks of disease among populations of wild fishes.",[],"['Paul Hershberger', 'Alexandra Hart', 'Jake Gregg', 'Nancy Elder', 'James Winton']"
"Detection of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSV) from the leech Myzobdella lugubris Leidy, 1851."," The leech Myzobdella lugubris is widespread in the Lake Erie Watershed, especially Lake St. Clair. However, its role in pathogen transmission is not fully understood. In this same watershed, several widespread fish mortalities associated with the Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSV) were recorded. Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia is an emerging disease in the Great Lakes Basin that is deadly to the fish population, yet little is known about its mode of transmission. To assess the potential role of M. lugubris in VHSV transmission, leeches were collected from Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie and pooled into samples of five. Cell culture and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to determine the presence of the virus and its identity. Results showed that 57 of the 91 pooled leech samples were positive by cell culture for VHSV and 66 of the 91 pooled leech samples were positive by RT-PCR for the VHSV. Two representative virus isolates were sequenced for further genetic confirmation and genotype classification. VHSV detected within M. lugubris was homologous to the Great Lakes strain of VHSV genotype IVb.

Specific regulation of the chemokine response to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus at the entry site.,"The fin bases constitute the main portal of rhabdovirus entry into rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and replication in this first site strongly conditions the outcome of the infection. In this context, we studied the chemokine response elicited in this area in response to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), a rhabdovirus. Among all the rainbow trout chemokine genes studied, only the transcription levels of CK10 and CK12 were significantly upregulated in response to VHSV. As the virus had previously been shown to elicit a much stronger chemokine response in internal organs, we compared the effect of VHSV on the gills, another mucosal site which does not constitute the main site of viral entry or rhabdoviral replication. In this case, a significantly stronger chemokine response was triggered, with CK1, CK3, CK9, and CK11 being upregulated in response to VHSV and CK10 and CK12 being down-modulated by the virus. We then conducted further experiments to understand how these different chemokine responses of mucosal tissues could correlate with their capacity to support VHSV replication. No viral replication was detected in the gills, while at the fin bases, only the skin and the muscle were actively supporting viral replication. Within the skin, viral replication took place in the dermis, while viral replication was blocked within epidermal cells at some point before protein translation. The different susceptibilities of the different skin layers to VHSV correlated with the effect that VHSV has on their capacity to secrete chemotactic factors. Altogether, these results suggest a VHSV interference mechanism on the early chemokine response at its active replication sites within mucosal tissues, a possible key process that may facilitate viral entry.",[],"['Jana Montero', 'Jessica Garcia', 'M Camino Ordas', 'Isabel Casanova', 'Antonia Gonzalez', 'Alberto Villena', 'Julio Coll', 'Carolina Tafalla']"
Wild fish are negligible transmitters of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype Id in the VHS restriction zone in Finland.,"Wild fish were suspected to be the source of reinfection by viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in Finnish brackish water rainbow trout farms located in a restriction zone regarding viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) comprising the entire Province of Åland, Baltic Sea, in the 2000s. Altogether, 1636 wild fish of 17 different species living in the vicinity of infected fish farms were screened for VHSV during the years 2005-2008. Additionally, 2 uninfected wild fish species as well as farmed whitefish were introduced into a VHS-positive fish farm to test whether they became infected by VHSV from the clinically diseased rainbow trout. Wild fish did not test positive for VHSV on any occasion. In contrast, whitefish introduced to a VHS-positive farm were infected with VHSV genotype Id and started to replicate the virus for a short time during the trial. Whitefish are farmed together with, or in the vicinity of, farmed rainbow trout in the study area and, according to this study, are a possible source of the recurring infection in the restriction area.

Sequential pathology after experimental infection with marine viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus isolates of low and high virulence in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L).,"Three marine viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus isolates were used to bath challenge turbot with the purpose of studying mortality and the pathology and antigen distribution over time. Two high-virulence isolates, 860/94, 4p168 and a low-virulence isolate 1p3 from a Baltic Sea herring were used. Organ samples were collected sequentially at 2, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 45 days postinfection. Specimens were processed for virology, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Organs during the early stages of infection (from 2 to 7 days) had virus isolation from all three groups only on day 7. Virus titer in kidney and heart sampled at day 25 was higher for the two virulent isolates compared with the low-virulence isolate. The viral distribution in situ of the two more virulent isolates from turbot (860/94) and herring (4p168) resembled viral hemorrhagic septicemia in rainbow trout with regard to the target organs. Early infection of endothelial cells in both kidney and heart was observed. Accumulated mean mortality was 41.5% for the turbot isolate 860/94, 48% for the herring isolate 4p168, and 3.5% for the herring isolate 1p3. This study revealed that the isolates from turbot (860/94) and herring (4p168) induced significantly higher mortality compared with the virus-free control and the herring isolate (1p3).

Reproductive hormonal variations and adenohypophyseal lesions in pre-pubertal buffalo heifers inoculated with Pasteurella multocida type B: 2 and its immunogens.,"Hemorrhagic septicemia is a fatal disease of cattle and buffaloes caused by P. multocida.

A prominent feature observed in infected fish were the petechial and ecchymotic haemorrhages on the body surface and in visceral organs, as well as serosanguinous ascites; however, many fish had few and subtle, gross lesions. Histologically, virtually all fish had a vasculitis and multifocal necrosis of numerous tissues. Excellent correlation was found between the presence of VHSV IVb antigen detected by immunohistochemistry and the pathological changes noted by light microscopy. Intact and degenerate leukocytes, including cells resembling lymphocytes and macrophages, also had cytoplasmic viral antigen. By contrast, renal tubules and gonadal tissues (ovary and testis), were strongly immunopositive for VHSV IVb, but no lesions were noted.",[],"['L Al-Hussinee', 'S Lord', 'R M W Stevenson', 'R N Casey', 'G H Groocock', 'K L Britt', 'K H Kohler', 'G A Wooster', 'R G Getchell', 'P R Bowser', 'J S Lumsden']"
"Detection of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) from Diporeia spp. (Pontoporeiidae, Amphipoda) in the Laurentian Great Lakes, USA.","The mode of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) transmission in the Great Lakes basin is largely unknown. In order to assess the potential role of macroinvertebrates in VHSV transmission, Diporeia spp., a group of amphipods that are preyed upon by a number of susceptible Great Lakes fishes, were collected from seven locations in four of the Great Lakes and analyzed for the presence of VHSV. It was demonstrated that VHSV is present in some Diporeia spp. samples collected from lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan, but not from Lake Superior. Phylogenetic comparison of partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences (737 base pairs) of the five isolates to sequences of 13 other VHSV strains showed the clustering of Diporeia spp. isolates with the VHSV genotype IVb. This study reports the first incidence of a fish-pathogenic rhabdovirus being isolated from Diporeia, or any other crustacean and underscores the role macroinvertebrates may play in VHSV ecology.",[],"['Mohamed Faisal', 'Andrew D Winters']"
Limited interference at the early stage of infection between two recombinant novirhabdoviruses: viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus.,"The genome sequence of a hypervirulent novirhabdovirus, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) French strain 23-75, was determined. Compared to the genome of the prototype Fil3 strain, a number of substitutions, deletions, and insertions were observed. Following the establishment of a plasmid-based minigenome replication assay, recombinant VHSV (rVHSV) was successfully recovered. rVHSV exhibits wild-type-like growth properties in vitro as well as in vivo in rainbow trout. The dispensable role of NV for the novirhabdovirus replication was confirmed by generating rVHSV-DeltaNV, in which the NV gene was deleted. This deletion mutant was shown to be as debilitated as that previously described for infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), a distantly related novirhabdovirus (S. Biacchesi, M. I. Thoulouze, M. Bearzotti, Y. X. Yu, and M. Bremont, J. Virol. 74:11247-11253, 2000). Recombinant VHSV and IHNV expressing tdTomato and GFP(max) reporter genes, respectively, were generated, demonstrating the potential of these rhabdoviruses to serve as viral vectors. Interestingly, rIHNV-GFP(max) could be recovered using the replicative complex proteins of either virus, whereas rVHSV-Tomato could be recovered only by using its own replicative complex, reflecting that the genome signal sequences of VHSV are relatively distant from those of IHNV and do not allow their cross-recognition. Moreover, the use of heterologous protein combinations underlined the importance of strong protein-protein interactions for the formation of a functional ribonucleoprotein complex. The rIHNV-GFP(max) and rVHSV-Tomato viruses were used to simultaneously coinfect cell monolayers. It was observed that up to 74% of the cell monolayer was coinfected by both viruses, demonstrating that a limited interference phenomenon exists during the early stage of primary infection, and it was not mediated by a cellular antiviral protein or by some of the viral proteins.",[],"['Stéphane Biacchesi', 'Annie Lamoureux', 'Emilie Mérour', 'Julie Bernard', 'Michel Brémont']"
"A survey of wild marine fish identifies a potential origin of an outbreak of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia in wrasse, Labridae, used as cleaner fish on marine Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., farms.","Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) was isolated from five species of wrasse (Labridae) used as biological controls for parasitic sea lice predominantly, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Krøyer, 1837), on marine Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., farms in Shetland. As part of the epidemiological investigation, 1400 wild marine fish were caught and screened in pools of 10 for VHSV using virus isolation. Eleven pools (8%) were confirmed VHSV positive from: grey gurnard, Eutrigla gurnardus L.; Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus L.; Norway pout, Trisopterus esmarkii (Nilsson); plaice, Pleuronectes platessa L.; sprat, Sprattus sprattus L. and whiting, Merlangius merlangus L. The isolation of VHSV from grey gurnard is the first documented report in this species. Nucleic acid sequencing of the partial nucleocapsid (N) and glycoprotein (G) genes was carried out for viral characterization. Sequence analysis confirmed that all wild isolates were genotype III the same as the wrasse and there was a close genetic similarity between the isolates from wild fish and wrasse on the farms. Infection from these local wild marine fish is the most likely source of VHSV isolated from wrasse on the fish farms.

Identification of immunogenic proteins associated with protection against haemorrhagic septicaemia after vaccination of calves with a live-attenuated aroA derivative of Pasteurella multocida B:2.,"Pasteurella multocida serotype B:2 is the causative agent of haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), a fatal disease of cattle and buffaloes. As a step towards the identification of individual antigens that may protect against HS, proteins present in a sonicated cell extract (SCE) and outer-membrane protein (OMP) preparation of a wild-type P. multocida serotype B:2 were investigated by immunoblotting with sera from calves which had been protected against challenge with a virulent strain of P. multocida B:2 by vaccination with a live-attenuated aroA derivative of the challenge strain. Five proteins in SCE, of approximately 50, 37, 30, 26 and 16 kDa, were recognised by the sera. In an OMP preparation, two bands, at 37 and 50 kDa, were recognised as strongly immunogenic. Mass spectrometry analysis of proteins corresponding in size to those detected by immunoblotting identified the 37 kDa band as OmpA, but the band at 50 kDa was not identified with certainty.

Differences in virulence of marine and freshwater isolates of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in vivo correlate with in vitro ability to infect gill epithelial cells and macrophages of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"Two strains of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) with known different virulence characteristics in vivo were studied (by a time course approach) for their abilities to infect and translocate across a primary culture of gill epithelial cells (GEC) of rainbow trout (RBT; Oncorhynchus mykiss). The strains included one low-virulence marine VHSV (ma-VHSV) strain, ma-1p8, and a highly pathogenic freshwater VHSV (fw-VHSV) strain, fw-DK-3592B. Infectivities toward trout head kidney macrophages were also studied (by a time course method), and differences in in vivo virulence were reconfirmed, the aim being to determine any correlation between in vivo virulence and in vitro infectivity. The in vitro studies showed that the fw-VHSV isolate infected and caused a cytotoxic effect in monolayers of GEC (demonstrating virulence) at an early time point (2 h postinoculation) and that the same virus strain had translocated over a confluent, polarized GEC layer by 2 h postinoculation. The marine isolate did not infect monolayers of GEC, and delayed translocation across polarized GEC was seen by 48 h postinoculation. Primary cultures of head kidney macrophages were also infected with fw-VHSV, with a maximum of 9.5% virus-positive cells by 3 days postinfection, while for the ma-VHSV strain, only 0.5% of the macrophages were positive after 3 days of culture. In vivo studies showed that the fw-VHSV strain was highly virulent for RBT fry and caused high mortality, with classical features of viral hemorrhagic septicemia. The ma-VHSV showed a very low level of virulence (only one pool of samples from the dead fish was VHSV positive). This study has shown that the differences in virulence between marine and freshwater strains of VHSV following the in vivo infection of RBT correlate with in vitro abilities to infect primary cultures of GEC and head kidney macrophages of the same species.",[],"['Bjørn E Brudeseth', 'Helle F Skall', 'Øystein Evensen']"
Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) remains viable for several days but at low levels in the water flea Moina macrocopa.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) Genotype IVb has been isolated from amphipods belonging to the genus Diporeia, but it has yet to be established whether crustacean zooplankton act as vectors of this virus for fish species. Therefore, we evaluated the viability of infectious VHSV in the water flea Moina macrocopa. VHSV was re-isolated from replicate groups of M. macrocopa that had been immersed with 108.0, 107.0, and 105.0 TCID50 ml-1 of VHSV (DK-3592B, Genotype Ia). Furthermore, 40 M. macrocopa that had been immersed with 108.0 TCID50 ml-1 of VHSV for 72 h had VHSV titers of 102.7-104.3 TCID50. Thus, VHSV was clearly taken up by M. macrocopa and remained viable in this crustacean for several days. However, no mortality was observed over a 28 d period in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss that were fed VHSV-contaminated M. macrocopa for 14 d, and we found that the virus titer significantly decreased after a 4 h incubation with pyloric caecal extracts from rainbow trout, indicating that passage through the gut is likely to result in a significant decrease in viral titer. This may explain why consumption of prey containing low levels of VHSV did not result in clinical VHS.","['Moina macrocopa', 'Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss', 'Vector', 'Viability', 'Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus']","['Takafumi Ito', 'Niels Jørgen Olesen']"
A mortality event in wrasse species (Labridae) associated with the presence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) is an infectious disease of farmed and wild fish and has an extensive host range in both freshwater and marine environments. In December 2012, a wrasse population consisting of ballan, Labrus bergylta (Ascanius), corkwing, Symphodus melops (L.), cuckoo, Labrus mixtus L., goldsinny, Ctenolabrus rupestris (L.), and rock cook, Centrolabrus exoletus (L.), held at a marine hatchery in the Shetland Isles, Scotland, experienced a mortality event. Approximately 10 000 wrasse were being held at the facility on behalf of an Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., aquaculture company prior to being deployed for the biological control of parasites on marine pen Atlantic salmon, aquaculture sites. Fish Health Inspectors from Marine Scotland Science initiated a diagnostic investigation, and subsequent diagnostic testing confirmed the site to be VHSV positive by qRT-PCR and virus isolation followed by ELISA. A VHSV genotype-specific qRT-PCR assay revealed that the isolates belonged to genotype III, the European marine strain of the virus. The virus genotype was further confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing of the partial nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) genes followed by BLAST nucleotide searches. This study reports for the first time the detection of VHSV within multiple wrasse species and highlights the need for a comprehensive risk-based approach to the use of wrasse and other finfish species as biological controls within the aquaculture industry.

Comparative susceptibility of representative Great Lakes fish species to the North American viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus Sublineage IVb.,"The present study compared the susceptibility of representative Laurentian Great Lakes fish species to the emerging viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) Genotype IVb. The median lethal dose of infection by intraperitoneal injection (IP-LD50) was obtained from fish that were experimentally infected with the MI03 index strain of VHSV-IVb. Fish were injected at doses ranging from 7 x 10(7) to 7 x 10(-2) plaque-forming units (pfu) and maintained at 12 +/- 1 degrees C. The infection trials identified species of high, medium, and low susceptibility based on the IP-LD50 values. Pathogenicity of VHSV-IVb was highest in largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, which resulted in an IP-LD50 of 1.5 x 10(2) pfu, while also demonstrating the clinical diathesis of VHSV-infected fish. The virus was moderately pathogenic in yellow perch Perca flavescens (IP-LD50 of 2.5 x 10(5) pfu), but also showed the classical signs of VHSV infection. Salmonids were the least susceptible to VHSV-IVb with IP-LD50 values of no less than 1.4 x 106 pfu; however, in fish that succumbed to infection, characteristic VHSV lesions were observed. Histopathologic alterations were most profound in gill, skin, muscle, gonads, and liver of largemouth bass and yellow perch, while in salmonids, hemorrhages in the swimbladder and/or degenerative changes in the liver were the most common lesions noticed. VHSV was isolated from infected fish, and its identity was confirmed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. These results highlight the variations among fish species susceptibility to this emerging strain of VHSV and offer insights into the potential impact of VHSV-IVb on the Laurentian Great Lakes fish community.",[],"['Robert Kim', 'Mohamed Faisal']"
Routine clinical inspections in Norwegian marine salmonid sites: A key role in surveillance for freedom from pathogenic viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS).,"Since the mid-1980s, clinical inspections of aquaculture sites carried out on a regular basis by authorized veterinarians and fish health biologists (known as fish health services: FHS) have been an essential part of aquatic animal health surveillance in Norway. The aims of the present study were (1) to evaluate the performance of FHS routine clinical inspections for the detection of VHS and (2) to explore the effectiveness of risk-based prioritisation of FHS inspections for demonstrating freedom from VHS in marine salmonid sites in Norway. A stochastic simulation model was developed to estimate site sensitivity (SeS), population sensitivity (SeP), and probability of freedom (PFree). The estimation of SeS takes into consideration the probability that FHS submit samples if a site is infected, the probability that a sample is tested if submitted, the effective probability of infection in fish with clinical signs, laboratory test sensitivity, and the number of tested samples. SeP and PFree were estimated on a monthly basis over a 12 month period for six alternative surveillance scenarios and included the risk factors: region, species, area production density, and biosecurity level. Model results indicate that the current surveillance system, based on routine inspections by the FHS has a high capability for detecting VHS and that there is a high probability of freedom from VHS in Norwegian marine farmed salmonids (PFree >95%). Sensitivity analysis identified the probabilities that samples are submitted and submitted samples are tested, as the most influential input variables. The model provides a supporting tool for evaluation of potential changes in the surveillance strategy, and can be viewed as a platform for similar exotic viral infectious diseases in marine salmonid farming in Norway, if they share similar risk factors.","['Atlantic salmon', 'Disease freedom', 'Fish health service', 'Rainbow trout', 'Risk-based surveillance', 'Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia']","['Trude Marie Lyngstad', 'Hege Hellberg', 'Hildegunn Viljugrein', 'Britt Bang Jensen', 'Edgar Brun', 'Evan Sergeant', 'Saraya Tavornpanich']"
Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV IVb) risk factors and association measures derived by expert panel.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is an OIE-listed pathogen of fish, recently expanding in known host and geographic range in North America. Through a group process designed for subjective probability assessment, an international panel of fish health experts identified and weighted risk factors perceived important to the emergence and spread of the viral genotype, VHSV IVb, within and from the Great Lakes region of the US and Canada. Identified factors included the presence of known VHSV-susceptible species, water temperatures conducive for disease, hydrologic connectivity and proximity to known VHSV-positive areas, untested shipments of live or frozen fish from known positive regions, insufficient regulatory infrastructure for fish health oversight, and uncontrolled exposure to fomites associated with boat and equipment or fish wastes from known VHSV-positive areas. Results provide qualitative insights for use in VHSV surveillance and risk-management planning, and quantitative estimates of contextual risk for use in a Bayesian model combining multiple evidence streams for joint probability assessment of disease freedom status. Consistency checks suggest that the compiled factors positively reflect expert judgment of watershed risk for acquiring VHSV IVb. External validation is recommended as the availability of empirical data permits.",[],['Vhsv Expert Panel And Working Group']
Combining surveillance and expert evidence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia freedom: a decision science approach.,"The ability to combine evidence streams to establish disease freedom or prioritize surveillance is important for the evaluation of emerging diseases, such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) IVb in freshwater systems of the United States and Canada. Waterways provide a relatively unconstrained pathway for the spread of VHSV; and structured surveillance for emerging disease in open systems has many challenges. We introduce a decision framework for estimating VHSV infection probability that draws from multiple evidence streams and addresses challenges associated with the assessment of emerging disease. Using this approach, historical and risk-based evidence, whether empirical or expert-derived, supplement surveillance data to estimate disease probability. Surveillance-based estimates of VHSV prevalence were described using beta distributions. Subjective likelihood ratios (LRs), representing contextual risk, were elicited by asking experts to estimate the predicted occurrence of risk factors among VHSV-affected vs. VHSV-unaffected watersheds. We used the odds form of Bayes' theorem to aggregate expert and surveillance evidence to predict the risk-adjusted posterior probability of VHSV-infection for given watersheds. We also used LRs representing contextual risk to quantify the time value of past surveillance data. This evidence aggregation model predicts disease probability from the combined assessment of multiple sources of information. The method also provides a flexible framework for iterative revision of disease freedom status as knowledge and data evolve.",[],"['L Gustafson', 'K Klotins', 'S Tomlinson', 'G Karreman', 'A Cameron', 'B Wagner', 'M Remmenga', 'N Bruneau', 'A Scott']"
The ABA392/pET30a protein of Pasteurella multocida provoked mucosal immunity against HS disease in a rat model.,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is a well-known high fatality septicaemic disease happening among bovines. The disease is caused by the Pasteurella multocida serotype B:2 bacteria. P. multocida B:2 has high mortality and morbidity rates and is spread through the intranasal and oral routes in bovines. In this study, our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the recombinant protein vaccine, ABA392/pET30a via intranasal inoculation by targeting the mucosal immunity. The constructed recombinant protein vaccine ABA392/pET30a was subjected to an animal study using Sprague Dawley rats. The study was divided into two parts: active and passive immunization studies. Both studies were carried out through the determination of immunogenicity (using Total White Blood Cell (TWBC) Count with Indirect ELISA) and histopathogenicity, analyzing (Bronchus Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) formation) in lungs. As a result, the IgA and IgG development of both tested groups: group 1 (50μg/mL protein vaccine) and group 2 (100μg/mL protein vaccine) showed equivalent with the positive control group 4 (formalin-killed P. multocida B:2). However, there was a significant difference when compared with the negative control group 3 (normal saline). These results demonstrate that both the protein vaccine at the concentration 50μg/mL and 100μg/mL have the same efficacy as the commercially available positive control vaccine. From the studies, higher concentration of protein vaccine at 100μg/mL showed higher development of both IgA and IgG compared to 50μg/mL protein vaccine. Higher and rapid development of IgA compared to IgG showed that mucosal immunity has been induced through the intranasal administration of the protein vaccine. In addition, leucocytosis was observed at each dose of vaccination showed that the protein vaccine is capable to induce the immune responses of the host. Histopathogenicity studies of the vaccinated groups showed more BALT formation and no severe lesions after challenge compared to the negative control group. Besides, no inflammatory onsite or anaphylactic responses were observed after the intranasal inoculation which proved to be safer and provided longer lasting immunity. Therefore, recombinant protein vaccine ABA392/pET30a could be a potential candidate for intranasal administration which can provoke mucosal immunity against HS disease.","['Haemorrhagic septicaemia', 'Histopathogenicity', 'Immunogenicity', 'Mucosal immunity', 'Pasteurella multocida']","['Tzin Lim Kang', 'Rita Devi Velappan', 'Nurul Kabir', 'Jamaludin Mohamad', 'Nurshamimi Nor Rashid', 'Salmah Ismail']"
Model for ranking freshwater fish farms according to their risk of infection and illustration for viral haemorrhagic septicaemia.,"We developed a model to calculate a quantitative risk score for individual aquaculture sites. The score indicates the risk of the site being infected with a specific fish pathogen (viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV); infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus, Koi herpes virus), and is intended to be used for risk ranking sites to support surveillance for demonstration of zone or member state freedom from these pathogens. The inputs to the model include a range of quantitative and qualitative estimates of risk factors organised into five risk themes (1) Live fish and egg movements; (2) Exposure via water; (3) On-site processing; (4) Short-distance mechanical transmission; (5) Distance-independent mechanical transmission. The calculated risk score for an individual aquaculture site is a value between zero and one and is intended to indicate the risk of a site relative to the risk of other sites (thereby allowing ranking). The model was applied to evaluate 76 rainbow trout farms in 3 countries (42 from England, 32 from Italy and 2 from Switzerland) with the aim to establish their risk of being infected with VHSV. Risk scores for farms in England and Italy showed great variation, clearly enabling ranking. Scores ranged from 0.002 to 0.254 (mean score 0.080) in England and 0.011 to 0.778 (mean of 0.130) for Italy, reflecting the diversity of infection status of farms in these countries. Requirements for broader application of the model are discussed. Cost efficient farm data collection is important to realise the benefits from a risk-based approach.

Conformation- and fusion-defective mutations in the hypothetical phospholipid-binding and fusion peptides of viral hemorrhagic septicemia salmonid rhabdovirus protein G.,"Fourteen single and two double point mutants in the highly conserved region (positions 56 to 159) of the G gene of viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), a salmonid rhabdovirus, were selected and obtained in plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis. Fish cell monolayers transfected with the mutant plasmids were then assayed for protein G (pG) expression, conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody (MAb) reactivity, and cell-cell fusion. Some mutations located in the phospholipid-binding p2 peptide (positions 82 to 110; mutants P86A, A96E, G98A, and R107A) abolished both MAb recognition and fusion activity, while others (P79A, L85S, and R103A) abolished MAb recognition but retained fusion at similar or lower pHs compared to those for the wild type. Phospholipid-binding assays of p2-derived synthetic peptides suggested that phosphatidylserine binding was not affected by the mutations studied. On the other hand, three (P79A, L85S, and T135E) of the four mutants retaining fusion activity mapped around two locations showing amino acid variation in 22 VHSV isolates and in neutralizing MAb-resistant mutants described previously. Mutations located in the hypothetical fusion peptide (positions 142 to 159; mutants F147K, P148K, and W154K) abolished both MAb recognition and fusion activity. The existence of mutants with altered conformation and defective fusion in both p2 and fusion peptides provides further evidence in favor of the participation of these and adjacent regions in some of the steps of the VHSV fusion processes, as suggested by previous studies. In addition, because the studied region induced strong immunological responses in trout, some of the mutants described here might be used to design attenuated VHSV vaccines.",[],"['A Rocha', 'S Ruiz', 'C Tafalla', 'J M Coll']"
Potential distribution of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus in the Great Lakes region.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVb has been responsible for large-scale fish mortality events in the Great Lakes of North America. Anticipating the areas of potential VHSV occurrence is key to designing epidemiological surveillance and disease prevention strategies in the Great Lakes basin. We explored the environmental features that could shape the distribution of VHSV, based on remote sensing and climate data via ecological niche modelling. Variables included temperature measured during the day and night, precipitation, vegetation, bathymetry, solar radiation and topographic wetness. VHSV occurrences were obtained from available reports of virus confirmation in laboratory facilities. We fit a Maxent model using VHSV-IVb reports and environmental variables under different parameterizations to identify the best model to determine potential VHSV occurrence based on environmental suitability. VHSV reports were generated from both passive and active surveillance. VHSV occurrences were most abundant near shore sites. We were, however, able to capture the environmental signature of VHSV based on the environmental variables employed in our model, allowing us to identify patterns of VHSV potential occurrence. Our findings suggest that VHSV is not at an ecological equilibrium and more areas could be affected, including areas not in close geographic proximity to past VHSV reports.","['Great Lakes', 'Maxent', 'niche modeling', 'remote sensing', 'viral haemorrhagic septicaemia']","['L E Escobar', 'G Kurath', 'J Escobar-Dodero', 'M E Craft', 'N B D Phelps']"
Molecular characterization of the Great Lakes viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) isolate from USA.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a highly contagious viral disease of fresh and saltwater fish worldwide. VHSV caused several large scale fish kills in the Great Lakes area and has been found in 28 different host species. The emergence of VHS in the Great Lakes began with the isolation of VHSV from a diseased muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) caught from Lake St. Clair in 2003. VHSV is a member of the genus Novirhabdovirus, within the family Rhabdoviridae. It has a linear single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome of approximately 11 kbp, with six genes. VHSV replicates in the cytoplasm and produces six monocistronic mRNAs. The gene order of VHSV is 3'-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5'. This study describes molecular characterization of the Great Lakes VHSV strain (MI03GL), and its phylogenetic relationships with selected European and North American isolates.The complete genomic sequences of VHSV-MI03GL strain was determined from cloned cDNA of six overlapping fragments, obtained by RT-PCR amplification of genomic RNA. The complete genome sequence of MI03GL comprises 11,184 nucleotides (GenBank GQ385941) with the gene order of 3'-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5'. These genes are separated by conserved gene junctions, with di-nucleotide gene spacers. The first 4 nucleotides at the termini of the VHSV genome are complementary and identical to other novirhadoviruses genomic termini. Sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis show that the Great Lakes virus is closely related to the Japanese strains JF00Ehi1 (96%) and KRRV9822 (95%). Among other novirhabdoviruses, VHSV shares highest sequence homology (62%) with snakehead rhabdovirus.Phylogenetic tree obtained by comparing 48 glycoprotein gene sequences of different VHSV strains demonstrate that the Great Lakes VHSV is closely related to the North American and Japanese genotype IVa, but forms a distinct genotype IVb, which is clearly different from the three European genotypes. Molecular characterization of the Great Lakes isolate will be helpful in studying the pathogenesis of VHSV using a reverse genetics approach and developing efficient control strategies.",[],"['Arun Ammayappan', 'Vikram N Vakharia']"
Virulence marker candidates in N-protein of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV): virulence variability within VHSV Ib clones.,"Four major genotypes of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), which have been isolated from many marine and freshwater fish species, are known to differ in virulence. While fast and low-cost genotyping systems based on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been developed for typing of VHSV virulence, there is a need for supplementing the knowledge. In particular, 2 field isolates from viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) outbreaks in sea-reared rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in Sweden, SE-SVA-14 and SE-SVA-1033 (both genotype Ib), have yielded contradictory reactions. In the present study, upon cloning by limited dilution, both isolates appeared to be heterogeneous in terms of reactivity with nucleo (N)-protein-specific MAbs as well their gene sequences. Infection trials in rainbow trout further revealed differences in the virulence of these virus clones derived from the same primary isolate. Based on a comparative analysis of the entire genome of the clones tested, we suggest that the differences in virulence are tentatively linked to substitutions of amino acids (aa) in the N-protein region covered by aa 43-46 and aa position 168, or a combination of the two. The fact that such minor naturally occurring genetic differences affect the virulence implies that even low-virulent VHSV isolates in the marine environment should be considered as a potential threat for the trout farming industry. The described MAbs can represent useful tools for initial risk assessment of disease outbreaks in farmed trout by marine VHSV isolates.","['Genotype Ib', 'Nucleo-protein', 'Oncorhynchus mykiss', 'VHSV', 'Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus', 'Virulence']","['Takafumi Ito', 'Jun Kurita', 'Koh-Ichiro Mori', 'Helle Frank Skall', 'Niels Lorenzen', 'Niccolò Vendramin', 'Nikolaj Gedsted Andersen', 'Katja Einer-Jensen', 'Niels Jørgen Olesen']"
Genotyping and pathogenicity of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus from free-living turbot (Psetta maxima) in a Turkish coastal area of the Black Sea.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) is one of the most serious fish viral diseases for cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), although VHS virus (VHSV) seems to be ubiquitous among marine fishes. In the present study, VHSV isolation was performed with free-living and cultured turbot (Psetta maxima) in the Trabzon coastal area of the Black Sea to evaluate participation of VHSV in mass mortalities of seed-produced turbot larvae. VHSV was detected in 14 of 66 free-living spawners (positive ratio, 21.2%), 1 of 65 free-living immature fish (1.5%) and 7 of 40 cultured brood stock (17.5%), respectively. Based on a partial glycoprotein gene nucleotide sequence, Turkish VHSV isolates were classified into the class I-e of genotype I and were the most closely related to the GE-1.2 isolate (>98% identity), which was found >20 years ago in Georgia. Thus, it was revealed that Turkish VHSV isolates were not introduced from European countries, it could be an indigenous type of VHSV distributing in the Black Sea environment. In pathogenicity tests, the Turkish isolates did not induce mortality in turbot larvae and rainbow trout fingerlings.

New tools to study RNA interference to fish viruses: Fish cell lines permanently expressing siRNAs targeting the viral polymerase of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus.,"Previous studies have indicated that low transfection efficiency can be a major problem when gene inhibition by the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is attempted in fish cells. This may especially be true when targeting genes of viruses which are fast replicating and which can still infect cells that have not been transfected with the antiviral siRNAs. To increase the amount of antiviral siRNAs per cell a different strategy than transfection was taken here. Thus, we describe carp epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cell clones expressing siRNAs designed to target the L polymerase gene of the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), a rhabdovirus affecting fish. Eight siRNA sequences were first designed, synthesized and screened for inhibition of in vitro VHSV infectivity. Small hairpin (sh) DNAs corresponding to three selected siRNAs were then cloned into pRNA-CMV3.1/puro plasmids, transfected into EPC cells and transformed clones were obtained by puromycin selection. Sequence-specific interference with VHSV could only be observed with EPC clones transformed with a mixture of the three shDNAs, rather than with those clones obtained with individual sh DNAs. However, interference was not specific for VHSV as infection with an heterologous fish rhabdovirus, was also reduced to a similar extent. It was shown that this reduction was not due to an Mx response in the transformed cell clones. Here, we discuss some of the possible reasons for such data and future work directions. EPC clones stably expressing rhabdoviral specific siRNA sequences could be a strategy to further investigate the use of RNA interference for targeting costly fish pathogenic viruses.",[],"['S Ruiz', 'B D Schyth', 'P Encinas', 'C Tafalla', 'A Estepa', 'N Lorenzen', 'J M Coll']"
"Comparative susceptibility among three stocks of yellow perch, Perca flavescens (Mitchill), to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus strain IVb from the Great Lakes.","The Great Lakes strain of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus IVb (VHSV-IVb) is capable of infecting a wide number of naive species and has been associated with large fish kills in the Midwestern United States since its discovery in 2005. The yellow perch, Perca flavescens (Mitchill), a freshwater species commonly found throughout inland waters of the United States and prized for its high value in sport and commercial fisheries, is a species documented in several fish kills affiliated with VHS. In the present study, differences in survival after infection with VHSV IVb were observed among juvenile fish from three yellow perch broodstocks that were originally derived from distinct wild populations, suggesting innate differences in susceptibility due to genetic variance. While all three stocks were susceptible upon waterborne exposure to VHS virus infection, fish derived from the Midwest (Lake Winnebago, WI) showed significantly lower cumulative % survival compared with two perch stocks derived from the East Coast (Perquimans River, NC and Choptank River, MD) of the United States. However, despite differences in apparent susceptibility, clinical signs did not vary between stocks and included moderate-to-severe haemorrhages at the pelvic and pectoral fin bases and exophthalmia. After the 28-day challenge was complete, VHS virus was analysed in subsets of whole fish that had either survived or succumbed to the infection using both plaque assay and quantitative PCR methodologies. A direct correlation was identified between the two methods, suggesting the potential for both methods to be used to detect virus in a research setting.

In vivo study of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus coexistence in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis).,"The effect of IPNV-VHSV coinfection and superinfection on the mortality caused by both viruses in Senegalese sole has been analysed. No effect was observed after coinfection. However, a clear viral interference was recorded between a primary IPNV and a subsequent VHSV infection, which led to a survival increase in the infected sole of 50% points when compared with fish infected only with VHSV. The significantly higher Mx transcriptional values in the fish pre-exposed to IPNV (at least at first days after superinfection) and the increased daily mortality when low Mx transcriptional levels were recorded suggest that Mx may be involved in the protective effect against VHSV infection. However, in fish subjected to VHSV primary/IPNV secondary infection, no interference was observed.","['\nSolea senegalensis\n', 'Mx', 'infectious pancreatic necrosis virus', 'viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus', 'viral interference']","['C López-Vázquez', 'M C Alonso', 'C P Dopazo', 'I Bandín']"
"Effect of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus on Pacific herring in Prince William Sound, Alaska, from 1989 to 2005.","We critically review the role of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in the 1992-1993 collapse of the Prince William Sound (PWS) herring fishery. VHSV was detected in samples of moribund Pacific herring from PWS in spring 1993 when about 63% of the expected fish failed to appear. A low prevalence and severity of VHSV were observed in adult pre-spawning PWS herring in most of the years from 1994 to 2002. The North American strain of VHSV became established about 500 yr ago in many northeast Pacific marine fish species, including herring. In Alaska, the typical annual prevalence of VHSV in pre-spawning herring ranges from 0 to 17%. New threshold analysis of a 9 yr study indicates that only about half of the virus-infected adult fish in PWS were clinically affected; ulcers formerly attributed to VHS have been overestimated by a factor of about 3. We conclude that VHSV was not a primary causative factor in the PWS herring population collapse or in its failure to recover. Because older age classes of herring were not disproportionately missing in 1993, the protozoan Ichthyophonus hoferi was also not a likely cause of losses. The 'Exxon Valdez' oil spill occurred in PWS, Alaska, U.S.A., in 1989. Evidence for interaction of oil and VHSV expression is also evaluated. A study exposing herring to varying concentrations of weathered crude oil showed increasing prevalences of VHSV correlated with oil concentration; however, repeated experiments with juvenile and adult fish failed to corroborate these results or link oil to VHSV infection in herring.",[],"['Ralph A Elston', 'Theodore R Meyers']"
"In-silico analysis of Pasteurella multocida to identify common epitopes between fowl, goat and buffalo.","Pasteurella multocida represents a highly diverse group of bacteria infecting various hosts like the fowl, goat and buffalo leading to huge economic loss to the poultry and cattle industry. Previous reports indicated that the outer membrane proteins contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of Pasteurella multocida. The comparative in-silico genome wide analysis of four pathogenic Pasteurella multocida strains (Anand1-poultry, Anand1-goat, PMTB and VTCCBAA264) with their respective hosts was performed. A pipeline was developed to identify the list of non-homologous proteins of Pasteurella multocida strains and their hosts. The list was further analyzed for the identification of the essential outer membrane proteins responsible for the pathogenicity. Outer membrane proteins were further selected from these antigenic proteins on the basis of their pathogenic potential. A common B-cell epitope (TDYRNRDRS, ARRSVTSKEN, and KINDQWRW) determined via sequential and structural approach from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) assembly outer membrane complex protein was predicted from fowl, goat and buffalo. Furthermore, we identified T-cell epitopes based on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) assembly outer membrane complex protein via docking studies which were either similar to the B-cell epitopes or were occurring in the same patch except for MHC class II M fowl. We propose that this difference in epitope sequence is due to different interacting MHC class II protein predicted from the fowl. Hence, in the current study we found that a unique epitope based on the common antigenic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer membrane complex protein present in fowl, goat and buffalo can be a suitable target for vaccine development against the two economic devastating diseases; fowl cholera (FC) and hemorrhagic septicemia (HS).

Stability of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in freshwater and seawater at various temperatures.,"Three North American and 1 European viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) isolates taken from either a marine, freshwater, or estuarine host were assessed for survivability in raw and filtered freshwater and seawater at temperatures ranging from 4 to 30 degrees C. All 4 isolates were substantially more stable in freshwater than in seawater, and higher survival was observed at lower water temperatures. The average time required for 99.9% inactivation of VHSV in raw freshwater at 15 degrees C was 13 d, while in raw seawater VHSV was inactivated within an average of 4 d. No consistent correlation was observed between the origin and the stability of the virus isolates. Freshwater isolates were not always the most stable in freshwater; similarly, seawater isolates were not consistently more stable in seawater. Virus survival was greatly enhanced in filtered freshwater with some virus strains remaining infective after 1 yr at 4 degrees C.",[],"['Laura M Hawley', 'Kyle A Garver']"
Inhibitory effect of mycophenolic acid on the replication of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus.,"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) remain two of the most important pathogens of farmed trout worldwide. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is an inhibitor of cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme that catalyzes an essential step in the biosynthesis of GTP. In this report, the antiviral activity of MPA against IPNV and VHSV in cell culture was assessed. Cell viability, virus yield, protein and RNA synthesis determinations were used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of MPA. MPA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of IPNV and VHSV replication. It was found that MPA had a particularly potent effect against IPNV, inhibiting the production of infectious virus more than 10(5)-fold. MPA was also highly effective in preventing viral protein synthesis. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to measure viral RNA in cells infected by IPNV or VHSV to evaluate the inhibitory capacity of MPA as well as to compare MPA to the established antiviral drug ribavirin. MPA showed a good efficacy in decreasing accumulation of viral RNA at low concentrations. Finally, time of addition and wash out experiments suggested that MPA may have a dual mechanism of action, targeting both a cell and a viral function. This study provides evidence that MPA can function as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug for use in therapy of rainbow trout diseases.",[],"['Laura Marroquí', 'Amparo Estepa', 'Luis Perez']"
Experimental horizontal transmission of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus.,"Infection by viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) has recently occurred among wild and farmed Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus in Japan. In the present study, horizontal transmission of VHSV among Japanese flounder was experimentally demonstrated by immersion challenge. Exposure to a flounder isolate (Obama25) of VHSV revealed a dose-response, with higher mortality (81 and 70%) at the 2 higher exposure levels (6.0 and 4.0 log10 TCID50 ml(-1)). In a second experiment, high titers of VHSV were expressed from moribund and dead flounder based on virus detection in holding-tank waters 2 to 3 d prior to death of the fish and 1 d after death. The virus could not be detected in tank waters 2 d after death.

Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV Id) infections are detected more consistently using syndromic vs. active surveillance.,"The eradication of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV Id) from Finnish brackish-water rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss farms located in the restriction zone in the Province of Åland, Baltic Sea, failed several times in the 2000s. The official surveillance programme was often unable to find VHSV-positive populations, leading to the misbelief in the fish farming industry that virus eradication could be achieved. The ability of 3 other surveillance programmes to detect infected fish populations was compared with the official programme. One programme involved syndromic surveillance based on the observation of clinical disease signs by fish farmers, while 2 programmes comprised active surveillance similar to the official programme, but included increased sampling frequencies and 2 additional tests. The syndromic surveillance concentrated on sending in samples for analysis when any sign of a possible infectious disease at water temperatures below 15°C was noticed. This programme clearly outperformed active surveillance. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method proved to be at least as sensitive as virus isolation in cell culture in detecting acute VHSV infections. An ELISA method was used to test fish serum for antibodies against VHSV. The ELISA method may be a useful tool in VHSV eradication for screening populations during the follow-up period, before declaring an area free of infection.","['Aquaculture', 'ELISA', 'Finland', 'Fish farm', 'Novirhabdovirus', 'Oncorhynchus mykiss', 'RT-PCR', 'Rainbow trout', 'Rhabdoviridae', 'Virus eradication']","['Pia Vennerström', 'Elina Välimäki', 'Tapani Lyytikäinen', 'Maria Hautaniemi', 'Gabriele Vidgren', 'Perttu Koski', 'Anna-Maija Virtala']"
"Regulation of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) interleukin-8 receptor (IL-8R) gene transcription in response to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), DNA vaccination and chemokines.","An interleukin-8 receptor (IL-8R)-like sequence has been previously reported in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss); however, no further studies to confirm its biological activity or regulation of expression have been performed. In this report, we have studied the regulation of the transcription of this receptor in response to different stimuli both in vivo and in vitro. We found that in response to a viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection, the levels of expression of IL-8R are suppressed in the head kidney, spleen and muscle, in contrast to what occurs in response to Poly I:C. These results might indicate a suppressive effect of the virus and a mechanism that enables it to elude the immune response. This response is no longer observed in vitro in the rainbow trout macrophage cell line RTS11, which has been shown to be resistant to VHSV complete replication, and where the virus produced no effect on the levels of mRNA expression of IL-8R. In these cells, as observed in vivo, Poly I:C significantly induced the expression of IL-8R, increase that came along with an increase in the chemotactic activity towards IL-8. In response to DNA vaccination, we found that the levels of mRNA expression are significantly increased only in the muscle at very early times post-vaccination. As an additional step to clarify whether this receptor is in fact being used by IL-8, we intramuscularly injected plasmids coding for different rainbow trout chemokines (IL-8 and other CC chemokines such as CK5B, CK6 and CK7A). Only plasmids coding for IL-8 and CK-6 were capable of significantly increasing the levels of transcription of IL-8R in the muscle. This effect was confirmed by the up-regulation of IL-8R mRNA production in head kidney leucocytes in response to recombinant IL-8 and CK-6.",[],"['Jana Montero', 'Amparo Estepa', 'Julio Coll', 'Carolina Tafalla']"
Temporary protection of rainbow trout gill epithelial cells from infection with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus IVb.,"The branchial epithelium is not only a primary route of entry for viral pathogens, but is also a site of viral replication and subsequent shedding may also occur from the gill epithelium. This study investigated the potential of agents known to stimulate innate immunity to protect rainbow trout epithelial cells (RTgill-W1) from infection with VHSV IVb. RTgill-W1 cells were pretreated with poly I:C, FuGENE(®) HD + poly I:C, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS + poly I:C or heat-killed VHSV IVb and then infected with VHSV IVb 4 days later. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was determined at 2, 3, 4, 7 and 11 days post-infection. Virus in cells and supernatant was detected using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All of the treatments delayed the onset of CPE (per cent of monolayer destruction), compared with untreated controls; however, killed VHSV or poly I:C combined with LPS was the most effective. Similarly, the detection of viral RNA in the supernatant was delayed, and the quantity was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by all treatments with the exception of LPS alone (4 days). Unlike many of the other treatments, pretreatment of RTgill-W1 with heat-killed VHSV did not upregulate interferon 1, 2 or MX 1 gene expression.

Trade practices are main factors involved in the transmission of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS), caused by the novirhabdovirus viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), causes significant economic problems to European rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), production. The virus isolates can be divided into four distinct genotypes with additional subgroups. The main source of outbreaks in European rainbow trout farming is sublineage Ia isolates. Recently, this group of isolates has been further subdivided in to two subclades of which the Ia-2 consists of isolates occurring mainly in Continental Europe outside of Denmark. In this study, we sequenced the full-length G-gene sequences of 24 VHSV isolates that caused VHS outbreaks in Polish trout farms between 2005 and 2009. All these isolates were identified as genotype Ia-2; they divided however into two genetically distinct subgroups, that we name Pol I and Pol II. The Pol I isolates mainly caused outbreaks in the southern part of Poland, while Pol II isolates predominantly were sampled in the north of Poland, although it seems that they have been transmitted to other parts of the country. Molecular epidemiology was used for characterization of transmission pathways. This study shows that a main cause of virus transmission appears to be movement of fish.

Protective immunity conferred by attenuated aroA derivatives of Pasteurella multocida B:2 strains in a mouse model of hemorrhagic septicemia.,"Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) is a fatal systemic disease of cattle and buffaloes. In South Asia HS is caused by infection with Pasteurella multocida serotype B:2. Some control is achieved with alum-precipitated or oil-adjuvanted killed whole-cell vaccines injected subcutaneously, but these vaccines provide only short-term immunity and require annual administration for effective use. Live attenuated vaccines have the advantage of a natural route of entry into the host, but for live strains to be used as vaccines, the mode of attenuation should be well defined. We constructed aroA attenuated derivatives of two P. multocida serotype B:2 strains by allelic exchange of the native aroA sequence with aroA sequences disrupted with a kanamycin resistance cassette or with marker-free aroA sequences containing an internal deletion. These strains were confirmed to be aroA mutants by PCR and Southern blot analysis, enzyme assay, and lack of growth on minimal medium. The aroA derivatives were highly attenuated for virulence in a mouse model of HS. Mouse challenge experiments showed that intraperitoneal or intranasal vaccination of an aroA strain completely protected mice against challenge with a high dose (>1,000 50% lethal doses) of either the parent strain or the other wild-type B:2 strain.

shRNAs targeting either the glycoprotein or polymerase genes inhibit Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus replication in zebrafish ZF4 cells.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) represents an important disease of finfish. To explore the potential of shRNAs to combat this disease nucleotide sequences of either the VHSV glycoprotein (G) or polymerase (L) gene were targeted.

Five of the six shRNA molecules successfully reduced VHSV replication by between 2 and 4 logs in titre relative to an irrelevant control shRNA at all MOIs and also reduced viral CPE at the highest MOI. To ensure that observed reductions in viral titre were dependent on shRNA silencing, potential non-specific antiviral responses were assessed.

Use of a cDNA microarray to study immunity against viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) following DNA vaccination.,"Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus juveniles were vaccinated against viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) by intramuscular injection of 10 microg of a plasmid DNA vector which encodes the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) glycoprotein (G) gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Experimental challenge of two viral doses (1 x 10(2) TCID50 and 1 x 10(3) TCID50) one month post-vaccination revealed that the G gene was able to induce protective immunity against VHS and this lasted until 21 days after the challenge. The VHSV G-protein gene DNA vaccine had a high protective efficiency, giving relative percentage survival (RPS) values of at least 93%. The defense mechanisms activated by the DNA vaccine were further elucidated by microarray analysis. Non-specific immune response genes such as NK, Kupffer cell receptor, MIP1-alpha and Mx1 protein gene were observed to be up-regulated by the VHSV G-protein DNA vaccine at 1 and 3 days post-immunization. Also, specific immune-related genes including the CD20 receptor, CD8 alpha chain, CD40 and B lymphocyte cell adhesion molecule were also up-regulated during that time. We observed significant up-regulation of some immune-related genes that are necessary for antiviral defense. Significant up- and/or down-regulation of unknown genes was also observed upon DNA vaccination.

Risk of introducing viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) to the Chilean South Pacific via sardine imports from Europe.,"Chile imports from Spain 100s of metric tons of frozen sardine Sardina pilchardus fished in European oceans, which, with several other clupeids, are presumed susceptible to infection with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). The frozen sardines are directly introduced into the sea as bait to catch southern hake Merluccius australis in the same areas where wild and pen-raised salmonids are present. A simulation model was therefore developed to evaluate the potential risk of infection of wild Chilean southern hake with VHSV from imported bait. The model indicated that VHSV-susceptible fish species present in Chilean waters, like southern hake, are not at immediate risk of infection. However, sensitivity analyses showed that infectious doses at lower concentrations of VHSV combined with higher VHSV-prevalence import scenarios could likely result in VHSV infections of a moderate number of indigenous southern hake (> or =54 fish yr(-1)).",[],"['Luis Pablo Hervé-Claude', 'Tim E Carpenter', 'Ronald P Hedrick']"
Involvement of the nervous system following experimental infection with Pasteurella multocida B:2 in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis): A clinicopathological study.,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is an acute, fatal, septicaemic disease of cattle and buffaloes caused by one of two specific serotypes of Pasteurella multocida B:2 and E:2 in Asian and African, respectively. It is well known that HS affect mainly the respiratory and digestive tracts. However, involvement of the nervous system in pathogenesis of HS has been reported in previous studies without details. In this study, nine buffalo calves of 8 months old were distributed into three groups. Animals of Group 1 and 2 were inoculated orally and subcutaneously with 10 ml of 1 × 10(12) cfu/ml of P. multocida B:2, respectively, while animals of Group 3 were inoculated orally with 10 ml of phosphate buffer saline as a control. All calves in Group 1 and Group 3 were euthanised after 504 h (21 day) post-infection, while calves in Group 2 had to euthanise after 12 h post-infection as they develop sever clinical signs of HS. Significant differences were found in Group 2 in the mean scores of clinical signs, gross and histopathological changes which mainly affect different anatomic regions of the nervous system. In addition, successful bacterial isolation of P. multocida B:2 were obtained from different sites of the nervous system.

Susceptibility of various Japanese freshwater fish species to an isolate of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVb.,"Genotype IVb of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) was isolated for the first time in the Great Lakes basin in 2003, where it spread and caused mass mortalities in several wild fish species throughout the basin. In order to prevent further spreading of the disease and to assess risks of new genotypes invading new watersheds, basic microbiological information such as pathogenicity studies are essential. In this study, experimental infections were conducted on 7 indigenous freshwater fish species from Japan by immersion with a VHSV genotype IVb isolate. In Expt 1, cumulative mortalities in bluegill Lepomis macrochirus used as positive controls, Japanese fluvial sculpin Cottus pollux, and iwana Salvelinus leucomaenis pluvius were 50, 80 and 0%, respectively. In Expt 2, cumulative mortalities of 100, 100 and 10% were observed in Japanese fluvial sculpin C. pollux, Japanese rice fish Oryzias latipes and yoshinobori Rhinogobius sp., respectively. No mortality was observed in honmoroko Gnathopogon caerulescens, akaza Liobagrus reini or Japanese striped loach Cobitis biwae. VHSV was detected by RT-PCR from samples of kidney, spleen, and brain from all dead fish, and virus re-isolation by cell culture was successful from all dead fish. We detected the virus in the brain from a few surviving bluegill 50 d post exposure by both cell culture and RT-PCR. These results revealed that VHSV IVb could become a serious threat to wild freshwater fish species in Japan, and that some surviving fish might become healthy carriers of the virus.

Rapid detection and quantitation of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in experimentally challenged rainbow trout by real-time RT-PCR.,"A quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) was developed to detect and determine the amount of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in organs of experimentally infected rainbow trout. Primers and TaqMan probes targeting the glycoprotein (G) and the nucleoprotein (N) genes of the virus were designed. The efficiency, linear range and detection limit of the Q-RT-PCR were assessed on cell cultured virus samples. VHSV N gene amplification was more efficient and more sensitive than the VHSV G amplicon. On cell culture grown virus, samples could be accurately assayed over a range of seven logs of infectious particles per reaction. To demonstrate the utility of Q-RT-PCR in vivo, bath infection trials were carried out and samples from fish spleen, kidney, liver and blood were harvested and tested for VHSV. Q-RT-PCR was a more reliable method than either conventional RT-PCR or the cell culture assay for virus diagnosis.

Do imports of rainbow trout carcasses risk introducing viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus into England and Wales?,"A qualitative import risk assessment was undertaken to assess the likelihood of introduction and establishment of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype 1a in England and Wales (E&W), via the processing of imported rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) carcasses from continental Europe. The likelihood was estimated for one import from an infected farm. Four main routes by which susceptible populations could be exposed to VHSV via processing waste were considered: (i) run-off from solid waste to watercourses, (ii) contamination of birds or rodents with VHSV by scavenging solid waste, (iii) discharge of liquid waste to mains drainage, and (iv) discharge of liquid waste directly to watercourses. Data on the biophysical characteristics of VHSV, its epidemiology, fish processing practices and waste management were collected. Likelihoods for each step of the four pathways were estimated. Pathway 4 (discharge of liquid waste to a watercourse) was judged as the most likely to result in infection of susceptible individuals. Levels of virus entering the aquatic environment via pathways 1-3 were judged to be many times lower than pathway 4 due mainly to the treatment of solid waste (pathways 1 and 2) and high levels of dilution (pathways 1, 2 and 3). Thirty-four trout farms process fish, of which seven have imported carcasses for processing. Compared with other processing facilities, on-farm processing results in a higher likelihood of VHSV exposure and establishment via all four pathways. Data availability was an issue; the analysis was particularly constrained by a lack of data on the prevalence of VHSV in Europe, volume of trade of carcasses into the UK and processing practices in E&W. It was concluded that the threat of VHSV introduction into E&W could be reduced by treatment of liquid effluent from processing plants and by sourcing carcasses for on-farm processing only from approved VHSV free areas.","['commodities', 'processing', 'risk assessment', 'viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus']","['F M Pearce', 'B C Oidtmann', 'M A Thrush', 'P F Dixon', 'E J Peeler']"
"Comparative immune responses in Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus after vaccination with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) recombinant glycoprotein and DNA vaccine using a microarray analysis.","A viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), recombinant glycoprotein vaccine (VHSVg) and a DNA vaccine (pCMV-VHSg) were injected in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Each fish was injected with 10 microg vaccine dissolved in 50 microl phosphate buffer saline (PBS). One month after the vaccination, the fish were challenged intraperitoneally with either 1 x 10(2) or 1 x 10(3) TCID(50) of virus. Fish that received the VHSg DNA vaccine were highly protected against virus infection over a 21-day observation period, with cumulative mortalities ranging from 4 to 10%. However, the recombinant protein vaccine group appeared to have low survival rates. Using microarray analysis, humoral defense-related genes such as complement component C3, complement regulatory plasma proteins, IgM, IgD, MHC class II-associated invariant chain and CD20 receptor were observed to be up-regulated by the VHSg recombinant protein vaccine at 1 or 21 days post vaccination. On the other hand, cellular defense-related genes such as CD8 alpha chain, T-cell immune regulator, MIP1-alpha and apoptosis-associated protein were not detected. Specific antibodies against VHSVg protein were detected in both vaccinated groups at a titer of 1:40 at 28 days post vaccination.",[],"['Ju Yong Byon', 'Tsuyoshi Ohira', 'Ikuo Hirono', 'Takashi Aoki']"
Improved stability of live attenuated vaccine gdhA derivative Pasteurella multocida B:2 by freeze drying method for use as animal vaccine.,"The efficacy of attenuated strain of gdhA derivative Pasteurella multocida B:2 mutant as a live vaccine to control haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) disease in cattle and buffaloes has been demonstrated. In order to use P. multocida B:2 mutant as a commercial product, it is essential to optimise its formulation for high viability and stability of the live cells. The effectiveness of freeze-drying process using different protective agent formulations for improving cells viability was explored. Sugar and nitrogen compounds were used as protective agents in freeze-drying and the capability of these compounds in maintaining the viability of mutant P. multocida B:2 during subsequent storage was investigated. A complete loss in viability of freeze-dried mutant P. multocida B:2 was monthly observed until 6-12 months of storage at -30 °C, 4 °C and 27 °C when nitrogen compound or no protective agent was added. Trehalose and sucrose showed significantly high survival rate of 93-95% immediately after freeze-drying and the viability was retained during the subsequent storage at -30 °C and 4 °C. A smooth cell surface without any cell-wall damage was observed for the cells formulated with trehalose under scanning electron micrograph. This study presented a freeze-drying process generating a dried live attenuated vaccine formulation with high stability for commercial applications.","['Cell morphology', 'Cell viability', 'Freeze drying', 'Protective agents', 'Storage', 'gdhA derivative Pasteurella multocida B:2 mutant']","['Siti Nur Hazwani Oslan', 'Murni Halim', 'Nurfahanah Amirah Ramle', 'Mohd Zamri Saad', 'Joo Shun Tan', 'Mohd Rizal Kapri', 'Arbakariya B Ariff']"

"The Laurentian Great Lakes strain (MI03) of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus is highly pathogenic for juvenile muskellunge, Esox masquinongy (Mitchill).","The Great Lakes strain of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) isolated from adult subclinical muskellunge, Esox masquinongy (Mitchill), in Lake St. Clair, MI, USA was shown to be highly pathogenic in juvenile muskellunge through intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection and waterborne challenge. Mortality began as early as 3 days after exposure in waterborne challenged fish, whereas fish infected by the i.p. route experienced the first mortality by 5 days post-infection (p.i.). The median lethal intraperitoneal injection dose (IP-LD(50)) was approximately 2.21 plaque forming units (PFU) as opposed to the median lethal immersion challenge dose (IM-LD(50)) of 1.7 x 10(4) PFU mL(-1). A high, medium and low dose of infection caused acute, subacute and chronic progression of the disease, respectively, as was evident by the cumulative mortality data. Clinical signs of disease observed in dead and moribund fish were very pale gills, dermal petechial haemorrhages along the flanks, severe nuchal haemorrhages, intramuscular haemorrhages at the fin-muscle junction and focal haemorrhaging on the caudal peduncle. Internal lesions included livers that were pale, discoloured and friable, and kidneys that were either congested or degenerative in appearance, and petechial to ecchymotic haemorrhages on the swim bladder wall. Histopathologic examination demonstrated massive haemorrhages in the swimbladder wall and muscle, severe vacuolation and multifocal necrosis of the liver, multifocal necrosis of the gills and depletion of lymphoid tissues within the spleen. Kidney tissues also exhibited a mixed pattern of degeneration that included tubular necrosis, interstitial oedema and congestion.

In vivo virulence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss correlates inversely with in vitro Mx gene expression.,"The in vitro replication of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) isolates from each VHSV genotype and the associated cellular host Mx gene expression were analysed. All the isolates were able to infect RTG-2 cells and induce increased Mx gene expression (generic assay detecting isoforms 1 and 3 [Mx1/3]). A trout pathogenic, genotype Ia isolate (J167), showing high replication in RTG-2 cells (by infective titre and N gene expression) induced lower Mx1/3 gene expression than observed in VHSV isolates known to be non-pathogenic to rainbow trout: 96-43/8, 96-43/10 (Ib); 1p49, 1p53 (II); and MI03 (IVb). Paired co-inoculation assays were analysed using equal number of plaque forming units per ml (PFU) of J167 (Ia genotype) with other less pathogenic VHSV genotypes. In these co-inoculations, the Mx1/3 gene expression was significantly lower than for the non-pathogenic isolate alone. Of the three rainbow trout Mx isoforms, J167 did not induce Mx1 up-regulation in RTG-2 or RTgill-W1 cells. Co-inoculating isolates resulted in greater inhibition of Mx in both rainbow trout cell lines studied. Up-regulation of sea bream Mx in SAF-1 cells induced by 96-43/8 was also lower in co-inoculation assays with J167. The RTG-P1 cell line, expressing luciferase under the control of the interferon-induced Mx rainbow trout gene promoter, showed low luciferase activity when inoculated with pathogenic strains: J167, DK-5131 (Ic), NO-A-163/68 (Id), TR-206239-1, TR-22207111 (Ie), 99-292 (IVa), and CA-NB00-01 (IVc). Co-inoculation assays showed a J167-dose dependent inhibition of the luciferase activity. The data suggest that virulent VHSV isolates may interfere in the interferon pathways, potentially determining higher pathogenicity.

"Reversible inhibition of spreading of in vitro infection and imbalance of viral protein accumulation at low pH in viral hemorrhagic septicemia rhabdovirus, a salmonid rhabdovirus.","The inhibition of viral hemorrhagic septicemia rhabdovirus (VHSV) in vitro infection by pHs of <7 (low pH) has been previously reported. Nevertheless, the details of the mechanism underlying this effect remain obscure. We present evidence showing that low-pH inhibition occurs during a viral postadsorption step. Thus, while VHSV bound, replicated within single cells, and presented its G protein on the membranes of infected cells at both low and physiological pHs, both cell-to-cell spreading of infection (as estimated by the appearance of foci of infected cells) and fusion (as estimated by a syncytium assay) were inhibited by this low pH. The decreased VHSV titers and the inhibition of both cell-to-cell spreading of infection and fusion could be reversed by adjusting the pH to 7.5 at any time during infection. This effect should be taken into account to avoid false negatives in the diagnosis of VHSV by cell culture. On the other hand, the cell-to-cell spreading of infection at pH 7.5 could be stopped at any time by reducing the pH to 6.5. Since at low pH there were changes in the protein G conformation and smaller and imbalanced amounts of N with respect to M1, M2, and G viral proteins, alterations of the assembly and/or budding of VHSV are most probably involved in the absence of newly released infective virions.",[],"['V Mas', 'A Rocha', 'L Perez', 'J M Coll', 'A Estepa']"
Molecular Epidemiology of Pasteurella multocida Circulating in India by Multilocus Sequence Typing.,"Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), a sequence-based typing method for bacterial pathogens, is currently the best method for long-term epidemiological study and to understand the population structure of the bacteria. This investigation was carried out to study the diversity of Pasteurella multocida isolates circulating in India. Ten different sequence types (ST) identified in this study are ST 122 from cattle, goat, mithun and pig; ST 50 from pig; ST 9 from cattle and sheep; ST 229 from cattle and goat; ST 71 and ST 277 from cattle; and ST 129, ST 280, ST 281 and ST 282 from avian species. Of these, ST 277, ST 280, ST 281 and ST 282 were identified for the first time. The analysis of results provides novel epidemiological information on the circulation of multiple STs across India. The majority of STs or their variants identified in this study have already been reported from different parts of the globe. This suggests that probably transboundary spread of strains across countries and continents has occurred across evolutionary time and is still happening. The isolation of ST 122 from small ruminants and pigs suggests that these species may be included in the preventive vaccination policy for effective control of haemorrhagic septicaemia in India.

Development of a walleye cell line and use to study the effects of temperature on infection by viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus group IVb.,"A cell line, WE-cfin11f, with a fibroblast-like morphology was developed from a walleye caudal fin and used to study the intersection of thermobiology of walleye, Sander vitreus (Mitchill), with the thermal requirements for replication of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) IVb. WE-cfin11f proliferated from 10 to 32 °C and endured as a monolayer for at least a week at 1-34 °C. WE-cfin11f adopted an epithelial shape and did not proliferate at 4 °C. Adding VHSV IVb to cultures at 4 and 14 °C but not 26 °C led to cytopathic effects (CPE) and virus production. At 4 °C, virus production developed more slowly, but Western blotting showed more N protein accumulation. Infecting monolayer cultures at 4 °C for 7 days and then shifting them to 26 °C resulted in the monolayers being broken in small areas by CPE, but with time at 26 °C, the monolayers were restored. These results suggest that at 26 °C, the VHSV IVb life cycle stages responsible for CPE can be completed, but the production of virus and the initiation of infections cannot be accomplished.

Molecular variability among strains of Pasteurella multocida isolated from an outbreak of haemorrhagic septicaemia in India.,"The applicability of conventional and molecular methods for rapid detection and differentiation of Pasteurella multocida serogroup B isolates involved in an outbreak of haemorrhagic septicaemia affecting Indian buffaloes, was studied. Five isolates were obtained and were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic characterization. None of the five isolates could be differentiated on the basis of cultural, biochemical, pathogenicity and antimicrobial sensitivity patterns. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques were found to be specific and sensitive for rapid detection and differentiation of isolates. Repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP-) PCR, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC-) PCR and single-primer PCR differentiated all the five isolates into different profiles. All the isolates involved in the outbreak were found to have a genetic profile different from standard P. multocida strain (P52). However, three isolates had similar profiles, whereas each of the remaining two had a different profile. The study indicates the involvement of multiple strains of P. multocida in a single outbreak of haemorrhagic septicaemia in buffaloes.

Diagnostic capacity for viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) infection in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is greatly increased by combining viral isolation with specific antibody detection.,Detection of disease specific antibodies in farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has been proposed as an alternative or supplement to the currently approved procedures for diagnosis and surveillance in this species. In samples from natural outbreaks of the disease viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) at two freshwater farms in southern Denmark serologic testing was used to broaden the diagnostic window from outbreak to diagnosis in the laboratory as compared to traditional procedures of isolation and identification of the virus. The serologic assay clearly increased the chance of detecting present or previous infections where the pathogen could not be isolated by standard methods (indicating older infections where the virus had been cleared). Our data allowed us to monitor the levels of neutralising antibodies in relation to the presence of the virus in fish experiencing two different types of outbreaks at two different farms. By sequence analysis of the viral glycoprotein from selected isolates we found no evidence for escape mutants having developed in the fish showing high titres of neutralising antibodies.,[],"['B D Schyth', 'E Ariel', 'H Korsholm', 'N J Olesen']"
Poly (I:C) and imiquimod induced immune responses and their effects on the survival of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) from viral haemorrhagic septicaemia.,"The stimulation of immune genes by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) and imiquimod in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and their role in control of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) infection were examined. Poly (I:C) (100 μg/fish) treated olive flounder had very low mortality (5%) post VHSV infection, while the imiquimod treated group had 65% and 85% mortality at a dose of 100 μg/fish and 50 μg/fish, respectively. Though the imiquimod treated group had high mortality, it was lower than the untreated group, which had 90% mortality. In vivo experiments were conducted to determine effect of the two ligands on immune modulation in the head kidney of olive flounder. Poly (I:C) activated the immune genes (TLR-3, TLR-7, MDA-5, LGP-2, IRF-3, IRF-7, IL-1β type I IFN and Mx) very early, within 1 d post stimulation, faster and stronger than imiquimod. Though Mx levels were enhanced by imiquimod, the host was still susceptible to VHSV. The poly (I:C) treated group had a high immune response at the time of infection and 1 dpi, though it decreased at later stages. The imiquimod treated group and the unstimulated group had a higher immune response to VHSV compared to the poly (I:C) treated group. The nucleoprotein copies of VHSV were very low in the poly (I:C) treated group but interestingly, were high in both untreated and imiquimod treated fish. Thus, host survival from a viral infection does not only depend on the quantity of immune response but also the time of response. Although imiquimod enhanced immune gene expression in olive flounder, a delayed response could be the reason for high mortality to VHS compared with poly (I:C), which induced the immune system effectively and efficiently to protect the host.","['Imiquimod', 'Interferon', 'Mx', 'Olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)', 'Poly (I:C)', 'TLR', 'VHSV']","['Satheesha Avunje', 'Sung-Ju Jung']"
Interaction between Pasteurella multocida B:2 and its derivatives with bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC).,"Pasteurella multocida B:2 causes bovine haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), leading to rapid fatalities in cattle and buffaloes. An attenuated derivative of P. multocida B:2 GDH7, was previously constructed through mutation of the gdhA gene and proved to be an effective live attenuated vaccine for HS. Currently, only two potential live attenuated vaccine candidates for HS are being reported; P. multocida B:2 GDH7 and P. multocida B:2 JRMT12. This study primarily aims to investigate the potential of P. multocida B:2 GDH7 strain as a delivery vehicle for DNA vaccine for future multivalent applications.An investigation on the adherence, invasion and intracellular survival of bacterial strains within the bovine aortic endothelial cell line (BAEC) were carried out.

Intracellular trafficking of the vaccine strain, P. multocida B:2 GDH7 was subsequently visualized by tracking the reporter proteins via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).The ability of P. multocida B:2 GDH7 to model bactofection represents a possibility for this vaccine strain to be used as a delivery vehicle for DNA vaccine for future multivalent protection in cattle and buffaloes.","['Bactofection', 'Bovine aortic endothelial cell', 'DNA vaccine', 'Haemorrhagic septicaemia', 'Pasteurella multocida']","['Nuriqmaliza M Kamal', 'M Zamri-Saad', 'Mas Jaffri Masarudin', 'Sarah Othman']"
Effects of temperature on infectivity and of commercial freezing on survival of the North American strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"Temperature affected the growth of the North American strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in experimentally infected cell cultures and in Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax. In addition, commercial freezing significantly reduced the infectivity of VHSV in tissues of experimentally infected sardine. Isolates of VHSV representing the geographic range of North American VHSV replicated in the EPC (Epithelioma papulosum cyprini) cell line at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C, but the more northern isolates from British Columbia, Canada, demonstrated significantly reduced growth at 20 degrees C compared to VHSV from more southern locations (p <0.001). An injection challenge of Pacific sardine with VHSV from California resulted in 66.7% mortality at a seawater temperature of 13 degrees C compared to 6.7% at 20 degrees C. Commercial blast-freezing of sardine experimentally infected with VHSV reduced median concentrations of virus in the kidney and spleen from 5.25 x 10(6) to 5.5 x 10(3) pfu (plaque-forming units) g(-1). Decreased growth of the California isolate of VHSV at higher temperatures following experimental infection of the sardine and reduced virus survival following commercial freezing of infected sardine are factors that would lessen the risk of transmission of VHSV through frozen baitfishes.",[],"['Kristen D Arkush', 'Holly L Mendonca', 'Anne M McBride', 'Susan Yun', 'Terry S McDowell', 'Ronald P Hedrick']"

Toll-like receptors and interferon associated immune factors in viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus-infected olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"Pattern recognition receptor (PRR) toll-like receptors (TLRs), antiviral agent interferon (IFN) and the effector IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) play pivotal role in antiviral innate immunity of a host. The present in-vivo experiment was conducted to investigate the role of these innate immune factors in early phase as well as during recovery of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) infection by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A less lethal VHSV infection was generated in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and was sampled at 3, 6, and 12h post infection (hpi), and 1, 2, 4, and 7 days post infection (dpi).

Viral copies were drastically reduced in 4 and 7 dpi fish, and also the immune response was considerably reduced but remained elevated, except for ISG 15 which found equal to control in 7 dpi fish. A high degree of correlation was observed between immune genes and viral copy number in each of the sampled fish at 12 hpi. A fish with ascites sampled at 7 dpi displayed high viral copy but under-expressed immune genes except for Mx. When viral copies were high at 1 and 2 dpi, both TLR 2 and TLR 7 were down-regulated, perhaps indicating immune suppression by the virus.

The ability of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Pasteurella multocida B:2 to induce clinical and pathological lesions in the nervous system of buffalo calves following experimental inoculation.,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of P. multocida B:2, a causative agent of haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) in cattle and buffaloes, is considered as the main virulence factor and contribute in the pathogenesis of the disease. Recent studies provided evidences about the involvement of the nervous system in pathogenesis of HS. However, the role of P. multocida B:2 immunogens, especially the LPS is still uncovered. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the role of P. multocida B:2 LPS to induce pathological changes in the nervous system.

Survey of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus in wild fishes in the southeastern Black Sea.,"Species diversity in the Black Sea ecosystem has been declining rapidly over the last 2 decades. To assess the occurrence and distribution of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in various wild fish species, a wild marine fish survey was carried out in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The pooled or individual samples of kidney, liver, and spleen of 5025 specimens, belonging to 17 fish species, were examined virologically using cell culture. The cells showing cytopathic effects (CPE) were subjected to ELISA and multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-mPCR), for VHSV and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), after blind passaging to determine the virus species causing CPE. The virus species and possibility of co-infection with IPNV were verified by the RT-mPCR developed in this study. Twelve species of fish (pontic shad Alosa immaculata, red mullet Mullus barbatus, three-bearded rockling Gaidropsarus vulgaris, black scorpionfish Scorpaena porcus, Mediterranean horse mackerel Trachurus mediterraneus, whiting Merlangius merlangus euxinus, stargazer Uranoscopus scaber, pilchard Sardina pilchardus, garfish Belone belone, round goby Neogobius melanostomus, thornback ray Raja clavata, and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus) tested positive for VHSV Genotype Ie (VHSV-Ie). Except whiting, pilchard, and round goby, the rest are new host records for VHSV. The extent and spread of VHSV-Ie was significantly higher among bottom fish than among pelagic fish. Sensitivity and specificity of the RT-mPCR developed was sufficiently high, suggesting that this assay may be used for both diagnostic and surveillance testing. According to the RT-mPCR results, IPNV was not present in wild fish. These results support the hypothesis that the VHSV-Ie genotype, highly prevalent among fish species in the Black Sea, may have a serious impact on the population dynamics of wild fish stocks.

Aliivibrio salmonicida requires O-antigen for virulence in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).,"Aliivibrio salmonicida is the causative agent of cold-water vibriosis, a hemorrhagic septicemia of salmonid fish. The bacterium has been shown to rapidly enter the fish bloodstream, and proliferation in blood is seen after a period of latency. Although the pathogenesis of the disease is largely unknown, shedding of high quantities of outer-membrane complex VS-P1, consisting of LPS and a protein moiety, has been suggested to act as decoy and contribute to immunomodulation. To investigate the role of LPS in the pathogenesis, we constructed O-antigen deficient mutants by knocking out the gene encoding O-antigen ligase waaL. As this gene exists in two copies in the Al. salmonicida genome, we constructed single and double in-frame deletion mutants to explore potential effects of copy number variation. Our results demonstrate that the LPS structure of Al. salmonicida is essential for virulence in Atlantic salmon. As the loss of O-antigen did not influence invasive properties of the bacterium, the role of LPS in virulence applies to later stages of the pathogenesis. One copy of waaL was sufficient for O-antigen ligation and virulence in experimental models. However, as a non-significant decrease in mortality was observed after immersion challenge with a waaL single mutant, it is tempting to suggest that multiple copies of the gene are beneficial to the bacterium at lower challenge doses. The loss of O-antigen was not found to affect serum survival in vitro, but quantification of bacteria in blood following immersion challenge suggested a role in in vivo survival. Furthermore, fish challenged with the waaL double mutant induced a more transient immune response than fish challenged with the wild type strain. Whether the reduction in virulence following the loss of waaL is caused by altered immunomodulative properties or impaired survival remains unclear. However, our data demonstrate that LPS is crucial for development of disease.","['Aliivibrio salmonicida', 'Atlantic salmon', 'Cold-water vibriosis', 'Lipopolysaccharide', 'O-antigen', 'Pathogenesis']","['Simen Foyn Nørstebø', 'Leif Lotherington', 'Marius Landsverk', 'Ane Mohn Bjelland', 'Henning Sørum']"
A novel multiplex RT-qPCR method based on dual-labelled probes suitable for typing all known genotypes of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) is a notifiable fish disease, whose causative agent is a rhabdovirus isolated from a wide range of fish species, not only in fresh but also in marine and brackish waters. Phylogenetic studies have identified four major genotypes, with a strong geographical relationship. In this study, we have designed and validated a new procedure--named binary multiplex RT-qPCR (bmRT-qPCR)--for simultaneous detection and typing of all four genotypes of VHSV by real-time RT-PCR based on dual-labelled probes and composed by two multiplex systems designed for European and American/Asiatic isolates, respectively, using a combination of three different fluorophores. The specificity of the procedure was assessed by including a panel of 81 VHSV isolates covering all known genotypes and subtypes of the virus, and tissue material from experimentally infected rainbow trout, resulting in a correct detection and typing of all strains. The analytical sensitivity was evaluated in a comparative assay with titration in cell culture, observing that both methods provided similar limits of detection. The proposed method can be a powerful tool for epidemiological analysis of VHSV by genotyping unknown samples within a few hours.","['VHSV', 'multiplex RT-qPCR', 'typing']","['D Vázquez', 'C López-Vázquez', 'H F Skall', 'S S Mikkelsen', 'N J Olesen', 'C P Dopazo']"
"Responses of pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins and cytological analysis in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during haemorrhagic septicaemia infection in buffaloes.","Sudden death is usually the main finding in field animals during haemorrhagic septicaemia outbreaks caused by Pasteurella multocida type B:2 that causes acute, fatal and septicaemic disease in cattle and buffaloes. This situation may be due to failure in early detection of the disease where early treatment of antibiotics may improve the prognosis of the animal and other surviving animals. Thus, there is a grey area on the knowledge on the potential usage of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins as early biomarkers in the diagnosis of haemorrhagic septicaemia. In addition, exploration of the cerebrospinal fluid during infection has never been studied before. Therefore, this study was designed to fill up the grey areas in haemorrhagic septicaemia research. Twenty-one buffalo calves were divided into seven treatment groups where group 1 was inoculated orally with 10 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline pH 7 which act as a negative control group. Groups 2 and 3 were inoculated orally and subcutaneously with 10 mL of 10<sup>12</sup> colony-forming unit of P. multocida type B:2. Group 4 and 5 buffaloes were inoculated orally and intravenously with 10 mL of lipopolysaccharide broth. Groups 6 and 7 were administered orally and subcutaneously with 10 mL of outer membrane protein broth. During the post-infection period of 21 days, blood and cerebrospinal fluid were sampled for the analyses of pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins and cytological examination. Buffalo calves infected with P. multocida and its immunogens via different routes of inoculation showed significant changes (p < 0.05) of pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins and cytological changes in both the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Buffalo calves from groups 3 and 7 showed the highest pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas group 6 had the highest acute phase protein concentration and group 5 revealed the highest value for cytology changes. In summary, results obtained in this study could be used as a profiling study to add novel knowledge to the haemorrhagic septicaemia research as well as the development of biomarkers.","['Acute phase proteins', 'Biomarkers', 'Buffalo calves', 'Cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cytology', 'Haemorrhagic septicaemia', 'Pasteurella multocida', 'Pro-inflammatory cytokines']","['Eric Lim Teik Chung', 'Faez Firdaus Abdullah Jesse', 'Ali Dhiaa Marza', 'Hayder Hamzah Ibrahim', 'Yusuf Abba', 'Mohd Zamri-Saad', 'Abdul Wahid Haron', 'Mohd Azmi Mohd Lila', 'Abdul Aziz Saharee', 'Abdul Rahman Omar', 'Md Zuki Abu Bakar', 'Mohd Jefri Norsidin']"

"Molecular epidemiology of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in British Columbia, Canada, reveals transmission from wild to farmed fish.","Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is a fish pathogen found throughout the Northern Hemisphere and is capable of infecting and causing mortality in numerous marine and freshwater hosts. In the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada, the virus has been detected for 20 yr with many occurrences of mass mortalities among populations of Pacific herring Clupea pallasii (Valenciennes) and sardine Sardinops sagax as well as detections among cultured Atlantic Salmo salar and Chinook Oncorhynchus tshawytscha salmon. We compared nucleotide sequence of the full glycoprotein (G) gene coding region (1524 nt) of 63 VHSV isolates sampled during its recorded presence from 1993 to 2011 from 6 species and a total of 29 sites. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all isolates fell into sub-lineage IVa within the major VHSV genetic group IV. Of the 63 virus isolates, there were 42 unique sequences, each of which was ephemeral, being repeatedly detected at most only 1 yr after its initial detection. Multiple sequence types were revealed during single viral outbreak events, and genetic heterogeneity was observed within isolates from individual fish. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed a close genetic linkage between VHSV isolates obtained from pelagic finfish species and farmed salmonids, providing evidence for virus transmission from wild to farmed fish.",[],"['Kyle A Garver', 'Garth S Traxler', 'Laura M Hawley', 'Jon Richard', 'Jay P Ross', 'Jan Lovy']"
Genotype-specific Taqman® assays for the detection and rapid characterisation of European strains of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is the agent of a disease that causes mortality events in marine and freshwater fish. It is one of the most important pathogens in European rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) aquaculture. Four major genotypes of the virus are recognised reflecting different geographic and host ranges. Genotyping of VHS isolates is important for disease management enabling monitoring of disease spread into new geographical regions or susceptible species. This study sought to develop molecular tools for rapid and efficient classification of European VHSV genotypes. Specificity of genotype-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays targeting the viral nucleoprotein (N) gene was tested using 66 viral isolates. All designed Taqman(®) RT-qPCR assays were genotype specific, displayed a high sensitivity and together constituted a diagnostic method for the rapid discrimination of European VHSV genotypes. Practical diagnostic applications of such assays demonstrated in this study include: (1) rapid genotype determination of isolates; and (2) identification of mixed-genotype isolates originating from pooled samples in areas where genotype distribution is known to overlap. However, the most important application will be supporting international VHSV surveillance programmes through the provision of a rapid specific and sensitive isolate characterisation method.",[],"['Fiona Bland', 'Michael Snow', 'Kyle A Garver', 'Iveta Matejusova']"
Concurrent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus septicemia and pyomyositis in a patient with dengue hemorrhagic fever: a case report.,"Concurrent presence of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), tropical pyomyositis and septicemia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a previously healthy person has never been reported. These three conditions even individually are potentially fatal. ""Here we describe a case of a patient contracting dengue and developing DHF along with concurrent pyomyositis likely to be due to MRSA, leading to MRSA septicemia with abscesses formed by MRSA"".A 44-year old previously healthy Sinhalese man presented on day 3 of the illness with fever, headache, arthralgia and myalgia and watery loose stools. His pulse rate was 76/min, blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, while cardiovascular, respiratory and abdomen examination findings were unremarkable. The test for the dengue NS1 antigen was positive on the same day. We have diagnosed dengue and started managing him symptomatically as per the current national guidelines. The patient developed DHF with bilateral pleural effusion and ascitis. On the day 5 he developed severe myalgia, tenderness and non pitting edema of lower limbs especially in the thighs. His creatine kinase levels were high and an ultrasound scan confirmed myositis of both thighs. We suspected myositis due to dengue but investigated for possible simultaneous sepsis as well. On day 9 his blood culture became positive for MRSA. Considering the sensitivity of the bacteria intravenous vancomycin and ciprofloxacin was administered for 21 days. He developed a small abscess at the site of the first intravenous access and a large one above the ankle on the left. On day 12 the latter was drained and the pus culture yielded MRSA sensitive to the same antibiotics. The rapid test for dengue IgM was negative initially but later a positive MAC-ELISA test entrenched dengue infection. After improvement he was sent home on day 33 of the illness. He has developed two other abscesses in the proximity of the drained one and they were drained on day 57. The patient recovered.When dengue patients develop symptoms and signs of myositis, prompt investigations for pyomyositis and the treatment can save lives.","['Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhgic fever', 'Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Septicemia', 'Sri Lanka', 'Tropical pyomyositis']","['N D B Ehelepola', 'R K G M Rajapaksha', 'D M U B Dhanapala', 'T D K Thennekoon', 'S Ponnamperuma']"
"Toll-like 4 receptor variant, Asp299Gly, and reduced risk of hemorrhagic cystitis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a major cause of morbidity after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern recognition receptor of the innate immune system and induces inflammation. Individuals with the single nucleotide polymorphisms Thr399Ile (rs4986791) or Asp299Gly (rs4986790) of TLR4 show diminished inflammatory responsiveness to endotoxins. The genotype of TLR4 was determined in 166 children who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and in their donors. Asp299Gly was present in 21 patients (13%) and 24 donors (14%). Thr399Ile was found in 22 patients (13%) and 25 donors (15%). The incidence of HC was significantly lower in patients with Asp299Gly (0% vs 23%; P = .009) and in patients who underwent transplantation from a donor with Asp299Gly (4% vs 23%; P = .05). The trend was the same for Thr399Ile-donor positive (8% vs 22%; P = .17), recipient positive (9% vs 22%; P = .25), donor or recipient positive (8% vs 23%; P = .04). Multivariate analysis revealed age, conditioning with busulfan, and absence of Asp299Gly as independent risk factors for HC. In conclusion, the TLR4 Asp299Gly variant seems to confer protection against hemorrhagic cystitis. This study provides the first indication that the innate immune system through TLR4 signaling pathway plays a role in the pathogenesis of HC after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",[],"['Bernd Gruhn', 'Norman Klöppner', 'Nadine Pfaffendorf-Regler', 'James Beck', 'Felix Zintl', 'Stephan Bartholomä', 'Klaus-Michael Debatin', 'Daniel Steinbach']"
Host and geographic range extensions of the North American strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was isolated from populations of Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax from the coastal waters of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, and central and southern California, USA. The virus was also isolated from Pacific mackerel Scomber japonicus in southern California, from eulachon or smelt Thaleichthys pacificus, and surf smelt Hypomesus pretiosus pretiosus from Oregon, USA. Mortality and skin lesions typical of viral hemorrhagic septicemia in other marine fish species were observed among sardine in Canada and in a few surf smelt from Oregon, but the remaining isolates of VHSV were obtained from healthy appearing fish. The prevalence of VHSV among groups of apparently healthy sardine, mackerel and smelt ranged from 4 to 8%, in California and Oregon. A greater prevalence of infection (58%) occurred in groups of sardine sampled in Canada that sustained a naturally occurring epidemic during 1998-99. A captive group of surf smelt in Oregon exhibited an 81% prevalence of infection with clinical signs in only a few fish. The new isolates were confirmed as North American VHSV and were closely related based on comparisons of the partial nucleotide sequence of the glycoprotein (G) gene. The VHSV isolates from sardine in Canada and California were the most closely related, differing from isolates obtained from other marine fish species and salmonids in British Columbia, Canada, Alaska and Washington, USA. These new virus isolations extend both the known hosts (sardine, mackerel and 2 species of smelt) and geographic range (Oregon and California, USA) of VHSV.",[],"['R P Hedrick', 'W N Batts', 'S Yun', 'G S Traxler', 'J Kaufman', 'J R Winton']"
Studies on pathogenesis following single and double infection with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were bath challenged with viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) virus or infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) virus or with both viruses simultaneously. The viral distribution and development of histologic lesions were examined using immunohistochemistry, while virus titer in kidney was determined by viral titration in cell culture. Single infections with VHS virus and IHN virus showed similar distributions of virus in internal organs. The early identification of virus in gill epithelium, 1 and 2 days postinfection (PI) for VHS virus and IHN virus, respectively, indicates that this organ is the point of entry for both viruses. The detection of VHS virus at 1 day PI and 3 days PI for IHN virus is indicative of kidney and spleen being the target organs for these viruses. A simultaneous infection of VHS virus and IHN virus resulted in both viruses establishing an infection. Further double infection did not result in a statistically significant lower titer of both viruses in kidney but a more restricted distribution of IHN virus in internal organs compared with the single infected group. The most striking finding is that, for IHN virus, virus was not detected in the brain in situ in the double-infected group. This study provides support for the conclusion that simultaneous infection with two piscine rhabdoviruses in a susceptible host results in some degree of interaction at the cell level, leading to a reduced systemic distribution of IHN virus.",[],"['B E Brudeseth', 'J Castric', 'O Evensen']"
Transcriptome analysis of rainbow trout in response to non-virion (NV) protein of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV).,"The non-virion (NV) protein of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), an economically important fish novirhabdovirus, has been implicated in the interference of some host innate mechanisms (i.e. apoptosis) in vitro. This work aimed to characterise the immune-related transcriptome changes in rainbow trout induced by NV protein that have not yet been established in vivo. For that purpose, immune-targeted microarrays were used to analyse the transcriptomes from head kidney and spleen of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) after injection of recombinant NV (rNV). Results showed the extensive downregulation (and in some cases upregulation) of many innate and adaptive immune response genes not related previously to VHSV infection. The newly identified genes belonged to VHSV-induced genes (vigs), tumour necrosis factors, Toll-like receptors, antigen processing and presentation, immune co-stimulatory molecules, interleukins, macrophage chemotaxis, transcription factors, etc. Classification of differentially downregulated genes into rainbow trout immune pathways identified stat1 and jun/atf1 transcription factor genes as the most representative of the multipath gene targets of rNV. Altogether, these results contribute to define the role and effects of NV in trout by orchestrating an immunosuppression of the innate immune responses for favouring viral replication upon VHSV infection. Finally, these transcriptome results open up the possibility to find out new strategies against VHSV and better understand the interrelationships between some immune pathways in trout.

"Differential viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus genotype IVb infection in fin fibroblast and epithelial cell lines from walleye, Sander vitreus (Mitchill), at cold temperatures.","A cell line, WE-cfin11e, with an epithelial-like morphology was developed from a caudal fin of walleye, Sander vitreus (Mitchill), characterized as distinct from the established walleye caudal fin fibroblast-like cell line, WE-cfin11f, and compared with WE-cfin11f for susceptibility to VHSV IVb. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to localize the intermediate filament protein, vimentin, the tight junction protein, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), the extracellular matrix protein, collagen I, and the viral protein, G. Although both cell lines contained vimentin, only WE-cfin11e stained for ZO-1 and only WE-cfin11f stained for collagen I. Ascorbic acid increased the accumulation of collagen I and caused the appearance of collagen fibres only in WE-cfin11f cultures. At 14 °C, both cell lines produced VHSV IVb, but the infection developed more rapidly in WE-cfin11f. At 4 °C, both cell lines became infected with VHSV IVb as judged by the expression of viral proteins, N and G, but only WE-cfin11f produced virus. The results suggest that cold temperatures can modulate viral tropism.","['VHSV', 'caudal fin', 'epithelial cells', 'fibroblast', 'viral tropism', 'walleye']","['N T K Vo', 'A W Bender', 'J S Lumsden', 'B Dixon', 'N C Bols']"
Impacts on rural livelihoods in Cambodia following adoption of best practice health and husbandry interventions by smallholder cattle farmers.,"To better understand how smallholder farmers whom own the majority of Cambodian cattle can contribute to efforts to address food security needs in the Mekong region, a five-year research project investigating methods to improve cattle health and husbandry practices was conducted. Cattle production in Cambodia is constrained by transboundary animal diseases (TADs) including foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) plus poor nutrition, reproduction and marketing knowledge. The project worked in six villages in Kandal, Takeo and Kampong Cham province during 2007-12. Farmers from three 'high intervention' (HI) villages incrementally received a participatory extension programme that included FMD and HS vaccination, forage development and husbandry training. Evaluation of project impacts on livelihoods was facilitated by comparison with three 'low intervention' (LI) villages where farmers received vaccinations only. Results of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) and socio-economic surveys conducted in 2012 of 120 participating farmers identified that farmer knowledge in the HI project sites exceeded LI sites on the topics of biosecurity, internal parasites, nutrition and reproduction. HI farmers adopted biosecurity practices including a willingness to vaccinate for FMD and HS at their own cost, separate sick from healthy cattle, grow and feed forages and displayed awareness of the benefits of building fattening pens. HI farmers that grew forages observed time savings exceeding two hours per day each for men, women and children, enabling expansion of farm enterprises, secondary employment and children's schooling. Logistic regression analysis revealed that farmers in the HI group significantly increased annual household income (P < 0.001), with 53% reporting an increase of 100% or more. We conclude that improving smallholder KAP of cattle health and production can lead to improved livelihoods. This strategy should be of interest to policymakers, donors, researchers and extension workers interested in addressing TAD control, food insecurity and rural poverty in Southeast Asia.","['One Health', 'food security', 'foot-and-mouth disease', 'forages', 'haemorrhagic septicaemia', 'poverty']","['J R Young', ""R A O'Reilly"", 'K Ashley', 'S Suon', 'I V Leoung', 'P A Windsor', 'R D Bush']"
"Factors controlling the early stages of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia epizootics: low exposure levels, virus amplification and fish-to-fish transmission.","Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus, Genogroup IVa (VHSV), was highly infectious to Pacific herring, Clupea pallasii (Valenciennes), even at exposure doses occurring below the threshold of sensitivity for a standard viral plaque assay; however, further progression of the disease to a population-level epizootic required viral amplification and effective fish-to-fish transmission. Among groups of herring injected with VHSV, the prevalence of infection was dose-dependent, ranging from 100%, 75% and 38% after exposure to 19, 0.7 and 0.07 plaque-forming units (PFU)/fish, respectively. Among Pacific herring exposed to waterborne VHSV (140 PFU mL(-1) ), the prevalence of infection, geometric mean viral tissue titre and cumulative mortality were greater among cohabitated herring than among cohorts that were held in individual aquaria, where fish-to-fish transmission was prevented. Fish-to-fish transmission among cohabitated herring probably occurred via exposure to shed virus which peaked at 680 PFU mL(-1) ; shed virus was not detected in the tank water from any isolated individuals. The results provide insights into mechanisms that initiate epizootic cascades in populations of wild herring and have implications for the design of VHSV surveys in wild fish populations.",[],"['P K Hershberger', 'J L Gregg', 'C A Grady', 'L M Hart', 'S R Roon', 'J R Winton']"
Induction of rainbow trout MH class I and accessory proteins by viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.,"Major histocompatibility (MH) class I receptors are glycoproteins which play a critical role during responses to intracellular pathogens by presenting endogenous peptides to cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes (CD8+). To date, little is known about MH class I regulation at the protein level during viral infections in fish. In this study, we characterised the MH class I pathway response to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and upon infection with viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVa using the rainbow trout monocyte/macrophage cell line RTS11. A 14-day challenge with VHSV IVa at 14°C demonstrated enhanced expression of the class I heavy chain, β2 microglobulin (β2M) and tapasin, while the expression of other accessory molecules ERp57 and calreticulin remained unchanged. However, when infection occurred at 2°C no change in expression levels of any of these molecules was observed. β2M accumulated in the media of RTS11 over time, however the β2M concentrations were 2 fold higher in cultures infected with VHSV 14 days post infection. Strikingly, when cells were maintained at 2°C the secretion of β2M was significantly reduced in both infected and non-infected cultures. These results indicate that VHSV infection alters the kinetics of β2M release as well as the expression of MH class I and suggests that cellular immunity against VHSV can be compromised at low temperatures which may increase host susceptibility to this virus during the winter.

Comparative analysis of the outer membrane protein profiles of isolates of the Pasteurella multocida (B:2) associated with haemorrhagic septicaemia.,"Outer membrane proteins (OMP) of P. multocida (serotype B:2) field isolates (n = 6) and a vaccine strain (P-52) were extracted by a sarkosyl method and characterized using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. About 20 polypeptide bands were observed in the profile of the vaccine strain with MW ranging from 16 to 90 kDa and, based on band thickness and intensity of staining, three polypeptides of MW 31, 33 and 37 kDa were considered to be the major OMPs. The profiles of the field isolates showed minor differences when compared with that of the vaccine strain. The OMP of 33 kDa was only expressed by the vaccine strain. Four field isolates expressed an OMP of 39 kDa, which did not appear in the profiles of the remaining two field isolates and the P-52 strain. Similarly, an OMP of 25 kDa was exclusively seen in the profile of a single isolate. By immunoblotting studies, using anti-P. multocida (P-52) whole-cell hyperimmune serum raised in rabbits as well as buffalo immune sera, it became evident that the polypeptide of 37 kDa was the most antigenic OMP in the profiles of all the isolates, including the P-52 strain. Other polypeptides were either weakly antigenic or visible in the profile of only a few of the isolates. The study thus identified the major OMP of P. multocida (B:2) and suggested that this highly antigenic 37 kDa OMP has potential for further protective and immunodiagnostic studies.",[],"['P Tomer', 'G C Chaturvedi', 'P Malik', 'D P Monga']"

In addition, a comparison between QTL detected for resistance and survival time to other important bacterial and parasite diseases affecting turbot (furunculosis and scuticociliatosis) was also carried out. Finally, the relationship between QTL affecting resistance/survival time to the virus and growth-related QTL was also evaluated. Several genomic regions controlling resistance and survival time to VHS were detected. Also significant associations between the evaluated traits and genotypes at particular markers were identified, explaining up to 14 % of the phenotypic variance. Several genomic regions controlling general and specific resistance to different diseases in turbot were detected.

Spatio-temporal risk factors for viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) in Danish aquaculture.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) is an economically very important fish disease in the northern hemisphere. When the VHS virus was first isolated in Denmark 50 yr ago, more than 80% of the 800 Danish fish farms were considered to be infected, but vigilant surveillance and eradication programmes led to a drastic reduction in prevalence, and finally, to complete eradication of VHS. Denmark thus obtained official status as an approved VHS-free member state within the European Union in November 2013. Data on outbreaks within the country have been collected since 1970, and here we combined these data with the geographical coordinates of fish farms to identify clusters of high disease prevalence and other risk factors. Our analyses revealed a statistically significant cluster in the southwestern part of the country, which persisted throughout the study period. Being situated within such a cluster was a significant risk factor for VHS. For freshwater rainbow trout farms situated inland, the number of upstream farms was a determining risk factor for VHS, as was distance to the nearest VHS-infected farm and year. Whether the farm used fresh or marine water in production did not have any influence on the risk of VHS, when accounting for whether the farm was situated inside a cluster of high risk. This information can be used when implementing risk-based surveillance programmes.

"Epidemiological aspects of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus genotype II isolated from Baltic herring, Clupea harengus membras L.","This study was carried out to clarify the role of wild fish, especially Baltic herring, Clupea harengus membras L., in the epidemiology of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in brackish water in Finland. Baltic herring with no visible signs of disease were collected from the Archipelago Sea, the Gulf of Bothnia and the eastern Gulf of Finland. In total, 7580 herring were examined by virus isolation as 758 pooled samples and 3029 wild salmonid broodfish as pooled samples during 2004-2006. VHSV was isolated from 51 pooled herring samples in bluegill fibroblast-2 cells, but not in epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells. The majority of isolations were from the coastal archipelago and from fish caught during the spawning season. Based on glycoprotein (G) gene sequences, the virus was classified as a member of genotype II of VHSV. Pairwise comparisons of the G gene regions of herring isolates revealed that all the isolates were closely related, with 98.8-100% nucleotide homology. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that they were closely related to the strains isolated previously from herring and sprat, Sprattus sprattus (L.), in Gotland and to the VHSV isolates from European river lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis (L.), in the rivers that flow into the Bothnian Bay. The infection in Baltic herring is likely to be independent of the VHSV Id epidemic in farmed rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum).",[],"['T Gadd', 'M Jakava-Viljanen', 'H Tapiovaara', 'P Koski', 'L Sihvonen']"
In vitro analysis of the factors contributing to the antiviral state induced by a plasmid encoding the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus glycoprotein G in transfected trout cells.,"We have found out that transfection of the RTG-2 cell line with the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) glycoprotein G (G(VHSV))-coding plasmid induces an anti-VHSV state, similar to that induced by poly I:C. Taking the advantage of the constitutive expression of toll-like receptor 9 gene (tlr9) in RTG-2 cells, we have investigated whether this antiviral state was induced by the cytosine-phosphodiester-guanine (CpG) motifs present in the plasmid DNA, by the endogenous expression of G(VHSV) protein or by both elements. For that, we have analysed the expression profile of the rainbow trout tlr9 and several genes related to TLR9-mediated immune response in the absence or presence of a lysosomotropic drug that specifically blocks TLR9-CpG DNA interaction. The results suggested that the high levels of cell protection conferred by a plasmid encoding G(VHSV) gene are due to G(VHSV) rather than to the CpG motifs within plasmid DNA. Therefore, plasmid DNA might not play a key role in the immune response elicited by DNA vaccines or perhaps other receptors instead TLR9 could be implicated in CpG motifs recognition and signalling. In addition, since RTG-2 cells express tlr9 gene, this cell line could be a good tool for screening TLR9 agonists, such as the immunomodulatory oligonucleotides (IMOs), as fish DNA vaccine adjuvants.",[],"['M Ortega-Villaizan', 'V Chico', 'A Martinez-Lopez', 'A Falco', 'L Perez', 'J M Coll', 'A Estepa']"
Weissella sp. outbreaks in commercial rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farms in Brazil.,"The genus Weissella contains 14 bacterial species that usually occur in nutrient-rich environments and in fermented foods and beverages. Outbreaks of hemorrhagic septicemia were reported in three commercial rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farms in Brazil in 2008 and 2009. Seventy-seven Gram-positive isolates were obtained from 41 diseased fish from these farms. The bacterial strains were identified as Weissella at the genus level using biochemical tests, Weissella genus-specific PCR, and 16S rRNA sequencing. To evaluate potential routes of infection, rainbow trout juveniles were experimentally infected with the pathogen. In addition, the resistance of the pathogen to five antibiotics was tested, and provisional epidemiological cut-off values were calculated using the normalized resistance interpretation (NRI). All isolates presented similar phenotypic profiles and positive reactions for Weissella genus-specific PCR. The 16S rRNA sequences of the Brazilian strains showed 100% similarity with sequences of Chinese isolates that previously were identified as the first case of Weissella sp. infection in fish. The disease was successfully reproduced in the laboratory by intraperitoneal injection, immersion, and cohabitation between diseased and healthy fish. All isolates were resistant to sulfonamide, and based on NRI analysis, one, two, and three isolates were classified as non-wild-type (NWT) for erythromycin, oxytetracycline, and norfloxacin, respectively. This is the first description of multiple cases of Weissella sp. infection in rainbow trout farms outside of China, of infectious routes for the disease, and of provisional epidemiological cut-off values for resistance of these bacteria to four antibiotics.",[],"['H C P Figueiredo', 'F A A Costa', 'C A G Leal', 'G A Carvalho-Castro', 'R C Leite']"
Identifying potential virulence determinants in viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) for rainbow trout.,"We identified viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) isolates classified within Genotype Ib which are genetically similar (>99.4% glycoprotein amino acid identity) yet, based on their isolation history, were suspected to differ in virulence in juvenile rainbow trout. The virulence of an isolate recovered in 2000 from a viral haemorrhagic septicaemia disease episode in a marine rainbow trout farm in Sweden (SE-SVA-1033) was evaluated in juvenile rainbow trout via intraperitoneal injection and immersion challenge alongside 3 isolates recovered from wild-caught marine fish (DK-4p37, DK-5e59 and UKMLA98/6HE1) suspected of being of low pathogenicity to trout. Mortality data revealed that isolate SE-SVA-1033 caused VHSV-specific mortality in both intraperitoneal and immersion challenges (75.0 and 15.4%, respectively). The remaining Genotype Ib isolates caused significantly lower mortalities using the same experimental infection routes (<35.0 and <2.0%, respectively). Having identified VHSV isolates with clear differences in their pathogenicity, coding and inter-genic non-coding regions of 2 isolates (SE-SVA-1033 and DK-4p37) were determined and compared in order to identify potential markers responsible for the observed differences in virulence. Only 4 predicted amino acid substitutions were identified across the genome sequenced; these occurred in the N (R46G), G (S113G), NV (L12F) and L (S56A) proteins. These findings form the basis for further studies aimed at determining the biological significance of these mutations and suggest that small changes at the molecular level can cause significant changes in the virulence properties of VHSV isolates.",[],"['S Campbell', 'B Collet', 'K Einer-Jensen', 'C J Secombes', 'M Snow']"
Impaired TLR2 and TLR7 response in olive flounder infected with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus at host susceptible 15 °C but high at non-susceptible 20 °C.,"The olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) is susceptible to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) at 15 °C but no mortality is observed at 20 °C even though the virus can grow profusely in vitro. Thus, we designed an experiment to better understand the immune response of olive flounder to VHSV when the host reared at 15 °C or 20 °C and infected with the virus. Olive flounder (18-22 g) reared at 15 ± 0.5 °C or 20 ± 0.5 °C were intra-peritoneally injected with VHSV (10(7.8) TCID50/fish) and sampled (n = 5) for head kidney at 3, 6, 12 hpi, 1, 2, 4 and 7 dpi; similarly, mock injected control groups (n = 5). Real-time PCR-based absolute quantification method was followed to quantify copies of VHSV gRNA and mRNA, while the immune gene expression of the olive flounder was quantified relative to internal control, β-actin. Viral infection resulted in a cumulative mortality of 24% in olive flounder reared at 15 °C, but no mortality was recorded in the 20 °C group or control groups. TLR2 and TLR7 expression at 15 °C was enhanced during early-infection phase (3-6 hpi) and recovery phase (4-7 dpi) when viral transcription was low, but expression was significantly reduced (12 hpi-1 dpi) at peak-infection period. However, the 20 °C group showed low viral transcription and expressed high level of TLR7 and a moderately higher unchanged level of TLR2. In both the groups, TLR3 expression was unaffected. Nevertheless, expression of MDA5 and LGP2 increased significantly irrespective of rearing temperature at the time of peak infection, hence at 15 °C VHSV down-regulated expression of TLR2 and TLR7 but not MDA5 or LGP2. Comparatively, at 15 °C IRF3 expressed high but IRF7 remained very low. Interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8) were significantly elevated in both the groups, but quicker and for a shorter period at 20 °C. In the 15 °C group, an extended period of expression of ILs could create an unsafe prolonged inflammatory condition. The olive flounders expressed high ISGs at 15 °C but were lagging by 12 h than 20 °C group. Based on these findings, we concluded that viral-mediated disruption of TLR2 and TLR7 expression in the 15 °C group could have delayed the host interferon response and provided a window for high viral growth. However, an effective host immune response at 20 °C contained VHSV from reaching the critical limit.",[],"['Satheesha Avunje', 'Myung-Joo Oh', 'Sung-Ju Jung']"
"Application of a sensitive, specific and controlled real-time PCR assay to surveillance indicates a low prevalence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in wild herring, Clupea harengus L., in Scottish waters.","Surveillance data on the distribution of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in the North Sea (UK), targeting Atlantic herring in areas with previous virus detection, were obtained from research cruises conducted during 2005. The sensitive molecular approach of real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was applied alongside a newly developed endogenous positive control assay specific for herring (elongation factor 1α) to ensure integrity of template. Three hundred and five pools from 1937 individual herring were tested, and no evidence of VHSV in association with wild Atlantic herring was detected. Samples were obtained from Scottish waters where marine aquaculture is conducted. The results confirm that previous tissue culture studies have most likely not significantly underestimated the prevalence of carrier herring in this area.

"Genetic relatedness among Japanese, American and European isolates of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) based on partial G and P genes.","Molecular virological analyses of 8 Japanese VHSV (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus) isolates from wild and farmed Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus were performed to investigate their genetic relatedness to American and European isolates of VHSV. Phylogenetic analyses based on the partial nucleotide sequences of G and P genes revealed that there are 2 genogroups of VHSV in Japan. The first one represented by the Obama25 isolate is closely related to the American isolates (Genogroup I) while the other, the KRRV9601 isolate, is closely related to the traditional European isolates (Genogroup III). The 2 types of Japanese VHSV showed differences in the relative mobility of the G protein and intensity of the antibody reaction on the P and M proteins. The Obama25 type of VHSV is widely distributed as a native virus in the coastal areas of western Japan and has been responsible for the occurrence of VHSV infection in farmed Japanese flounder while the KRRV9601 isolate is considered to have been introduced from a foreign country.",[],"['T Nishizawa', 'H Iida', 'R Takano', 'T Isshiki', 'K Nakajima', 'K Muroga']"
Fulminant <i>Bacillus cereus</i> septicaemia with multiple organ ischaemic/haemorrhagic complications in a patient undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia.,"<i>Bacillus cereus</i> is a Gram-positive spore-forming rod widely found in the environment and is thought to be a frequent source of contamination. This micro-organism is reportedly a significant pathogenic agent among immunocompromised individuals. Furthermore, multiple cases of fulminant septicaemia have been reported among individuals receiving chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia. In some cases, <i>B. cereus</i> septicaemia was associated with multiple haemorrhages. We, herein, describe a patient with an extremely acute course of <i>B. cereus</i> septicaemia characterised by haemorrhage and infarction of multiple organs, which led to his death. Our findings suggest that delayed treatment of <i>B. cereus</i> in patients with haematologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy may result in extremely poor outcomes; thus, immediate empirical treatment with vancomycin should be considered.","['haematology (incl blood transfusion)', 'infectious diseases', 'stroke']","['Yusuke S Hori', 'Satoshi Kodera', 'Yurie Nagai', 'Yoshio Suzuki']"
First isolation and genotyping of viruses from recent outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) in Slovenia.,"In November and December 2007, the virus causing viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) was detected in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss from 2 fish farms in Slovenia. During 2008 and 2009 the infection spread only among rainbow trout farms and 4 new outbreaks were confirmed. High mortality and clinical signs of VHS were observed among the diseased fish. VHSV was confirmed by virus isolation, immunoperoxidase test, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and phylogenetic analysis. Based on 1 complete (1524 nucleotides [nt]) and 9 partial (600 nt) glycoprotein gene nucleotide sequences, 9 VHSV isolates from the 6 VHS outbreaks were genetically closely related (99 to 100% identity), and were classified into the Subgroup I-a of Genotype I, most closely related to the German isolates Dstg21-07, Dstg36-06, and Dstg54-1-07 (99 to 100% identity). Phylogenetic analysis and epidemiological investigations confirmed that the VHS virus had been (re)introduced with imported live fish, and that subsequent outbreaks were linked to the initial infection. Our study shows that direct nucleotide sequencing of RT-PCR products, amplified from the tissue of VHSV-infected fish, represents a reliable tool for fast routine genotyping in diagnostic laboratories. This is the first report of a natural epidemic associated with VHSV infection in Slovenia since the eradication of the disease in 1977.",[],"['Ivan Toplak', 'Peter Hostnik', 'Danijela Rihtaric', 'Niels Jørgen Olesen', 'Helle Frank Skall', 'Vlasta Jencic']"
Recombinant transferrin binding protein A (rTbpA) fragments of Pasteurella multocida serogroup B:2 provide variable protection following homologous challenge in mouse model.,"Transferrin binding protein A (TbpA), an iron acquisition surface protein that also acts as virulence factor, is widely distributed among strains of Pasteurella multocida. In the present study, a total of seven clones of TbpA fragments (39D to F777; 39D to Q697; 188V to F777; 188V to Q697; 39D to P377; 188V to P377 and 39D to F187) belonging to P. multocida B:2 were constructed, over-expressed and purified as recombinant fusion proteins from Escherichia coli using affinity chromatography.

Recognition of cis-acting elements of infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus by homologous and heterologous helper proteins.,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) are grouped in the Novirhabdovirus genus within the family Rhabdoviridae. There are many similarities between these two viruses including the lengths of the leader and trailer regions and the homologies of the terminal sequences. We have developed two systems in which IHNV and VHSV minigenomes encoding the marker green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be expressed from plasmids by T7 RNA polymerase. These negative sense minigenome RNAs can be replicated, transcribed and packaged into infectious particles when coinfected with homologous helper viruses. After infection of the minigenome transfected BHK-T7 cells by heterologous helper viruses GFP expression was observed, but packaging of the minigenome RNAs into virus particles did not occur. Packaging of chimeric minigenomes by IHNV and VHSV was also not observed. Cotransfections of the negative sense minigenome plasmids with plasmids encoding nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P) and RNA polymerase (L) of IHNV and VHSV were carried out in all combinations. Minigenome constructs were expressed only after cotransfection with a set of helper plasmids (N, P and L) all originated from one virus. These results indicate that the cis-acting elements responsible for the encapsidation and transcription were recognized by the homologous and heterologous helper proteins, but packaging of the minigenome RNAs required homologous helper viruses.",[],"['Bernd Hoffmann', 'Heike Schütze', 'Thomas C Mettenleiter']"
Development of an oral vaccine for immunisation of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia.,"In the European Union Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (VHS) eradication is still based on stamping out. Due to the lack of effective low cost vaccines immune prophylaxis is currently not used to combat VHS. This paper describes a new oral delivery method for immunisation of trout with attenuated virus. The vaccine consists of lyophilised virus surrounded by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and was extruded under low temperature. In the stomach of trout, the use of additional neutralising and adsorbing bases resulted in a neutral pH around the vaccine pellets, thus protecting the antigen against gastric acid. The in vivo efficacy of this delivery method was examined in three animal challenge experiments using an attenuated VHS virus (VHSV) strain as a vaccine. After vaccination, VHSV mRNA in gut, heart, kidney, spleen and blood was amplified by semi-nested PCR after RT-PCR. Indirect immune fluorescence test detected VHS vaccine virus in the gut. The expression of MHC class II, CD4 and CD8alpha mRNAs after oral vaccination was measured in gut using real-time RT-PCR. Antibody levels were measured by ELISA one week before vaccination and five weeks after vaccination. Animals were challenged six weeks after vaccination with highly virulent VHSV and mortality was recorded. The experiments showed that orally delivered vaccine virus was released from the vaccine preparation, penetrated the gut mucosa and led to higher expression levels of MHC class II and CD4 mRNAs when compared to control guts. VHSV antibodies were detected after oral vaccination. Immunisation with this new vaccine formulation was followed by a significant protection against VHSV. While the cumulative mortality in the non-vaccinated control group reached 70%, more than 75% of the orally vaccinated fish were protected upon challenge.",[],"['Malte Adelmann', 'Bernd Köllner', 'Sven M Bergmann', 'Uwe Fischer', 'Bodo Lange', 'Werner Weitschies', 'Peter-Joachim Enzmann', 'Dieter Fichtner']"
Microarray-based identification of differentially expressed genes in families of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) after infection with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV).,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is one of the major threats to the development of the aquaculture industry worldwide. The present study was aimed to identify genes differentially expressed in several turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) families showing different mortality rates after VHSV. The expression analysis was conducted through genome-wide expression profiling with an oligo-microarray in the head kidney. A significant proportion of the variation in the gene expression profiles seemed to be explained by the genetic background, indicating that the mechanisms by which particular species and/or populations can resist a pathogen(s) are complex and multifactorial. Before the experimental infections, fish from resistant families (low mortality rates after VHSV infection) showed high expression of different antimicrobial peptides, suggesting that their pre-immune state may be stronger than fish of susceptible families (high mortality rates after VHSV infection). After infection, fish from both high- and low-mortality families showed an up-modulation of the interferon-induced Mx2 gene, the IL-8 gene and the VHSV-induced protein 5 gene compared with control groups. Low levels of several molecules secreted in the mucus were observed in high-mortality families, but different genes involved in viral entrance into target cells were down-regulated in low-mortality families. Moreover, these families also showed a strong down-modulation of marker genes related to VHSV target organs, including biochemical markers of renal dysfunction and myocardial injury. In general, the expression of different genes involved in the metabolism of sugars, lipids and proteins were decreased in both low- and high-mortality families after infection. The present study serves as an initial screen for genes of interest and provides an extensive overview of the genetic basis underlying the differences between families that are resistant or susceptible to VHSV infection.",[],"['P Díaz-Rosales', 'A Romero', 'P Balseiro', 'S Dios', 'B Novoa', 'A Figueras']"
Structural analysis and cross-protective efficacy of recombinant 87 kDa outer membrane protein (Omp87) of Pasteurella multocida serogroup B:2.,"Pasteurella multocida serogroup B:2, a causative agent of haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) in cattle and buffalo especially in tropical regions of Asian and African countries, is known to possess several outer membrane proteins (OMPs) as immunogenic antigens.

Development of a monoclonal antibody against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVa.,"The viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) comprises 4 major genotypes and a number of subtypes with, in most cases, distinct geographical distribution. A quick and simple detection method that can discriminate the different genotypes is desirable for a quick and more efficient prevention of the spread of genotypes to new geographical areas. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) against VHSV genotype IVa was produced, with the aim of providing a simple method of discriminating this genotype from the other VHSV genotypes (I, II, III and IVb). Balb/c mice were injected with purified VHSV-JF00Ehil (genotype IVa) from diseased farmed Japanese flounder. Ten hybridoma clones secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against VHSV were established. One of these, MAb VHS-10, reacted only with genotype IVa in indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) and ELISA. Using cell cultures that were transfected with each of the viral protein genes, it was shown that the MAb VHS-10 recognizes a nonlinear genotype IVa-specific epitope on the VHSV N-protein.",[],"['T Ito', 'N J Olesen', 'H F Skall', 'M Sano', 'J Kurita', 'K Nakajima', 'T Iida']"

"Oral transmission as a route of infection for viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum).","Surveys among wild marine fish have revealed occurrence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) infections in a high number of diverse fish species. In marine aquaculture of rainbow trout, preying on invading wild fish might thus be a risk factor for introduction and adaptation of VHSV and subsequent disease outbreaks. Our objective was to determine whether an oral transmission route for VHSV in rainbow trout exists. Juvenile trout were infected through oral, waterborne and cohabitation transmission routes, using a recombinant virus strain harbouring Renilla luciferase as reporter gene. Viral replication in stomach and kidney tissue was detected through bioluminescence activity of luciferase and qRT-PCR. Replication was detected in both tissues, irrespective of transmission route. Replication patterns, however, differed among transmission routes. In trout infected through oral transmission, replication was detected in the stomach prior to kidney tissue. In trout infected through waterborne or cohabitation transmission, replication was detected in kidney prior to stomach or in both tissues simultaneously. We demonstrate the existence of an oral transmission route for VHSV in rainbow trout. This implies that preying on invading infected wild fish is a risk factor for introduction of VHSV into marine cultures of rainbow trout.",[],"['A A Schönherz', 'M H H Hansen', 'H B H Jørgensen', 'P Berg', 'N Lorenzen', 'K Einer-Jensen']"

Temperature-dependent viral replication and antiviral apoptotic response in viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV)-infected olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"The olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) shows a high rate of mortality to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in the winter and spring but has zero mortality over 20 °C. In this experiment, we studied the effect of rearing temperature on viral replication, viral transcription and antiviral apoptotic immune response in VHSV-infected olive flounder by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Olive flounder were given intra-peritoneal injections of VHSV (10(7.8) TCID(50)/ml) and were reared at 15 °C or 20 °C. Five fish were randomly sampled for head kidney at 3, 6 and 12 h post-infection (hpi) and 1, 2, 4 and 7 days post-infection (dpi). Total RNA extracted from the tissue was reverse transcribed and used as template for real-time PCR. In the 15 °C group, the number of viral gRNA copies peaked after 2 dpi and remained high through 7 dpi, while in the 20 °C group, the copy number was at the highest at 1 dpi but drastically declined at later stages. Viral mRNA levels in the 15 °C group gradually increased starting at 3 hpi to reach their maximum value at 12 hpi and remained high until 2 dpi, whereas the other group showed much lower copy numbers that were undetectably low at 4 and 7 dpi. Type II IFN expression increased as the viral copies increased and the 20 °C group showed quicker and stronger expression than the 15 °C group. The MHC class I and CD8 expression was high in both the groups at early stage of infection (3-6 hpi) but at later stages (2-7 dpi) in 15 °C group expression reduced below control levels, while they expressed higher to control in 20 °C group. The expression of granzyme in 15 °C fish showed a single peak at 2 dpi, but was consistently expressing in 20 °C fish. Individuals expressed very high levels of perforin expressed very high levels of caspase 3. In 15 °C fish, TNFα, FasL and p53 expressed significantly higher than 20 °C only at initial stages of infection (3-6 hpi). Caspase 3 expression found to be low in 15 °C fish whereas it was significantly elevated in 20 °C group. Interestingly individual fish with high caspase 3 expression contained very low viral RNA. Thus, from our experiment, we can conclude that an effective apoptotic immune response in VHSV-infected olive flounder plays a crucial role in the survival of the host at higher temperatures.",[],"['Satheesha Avunje', 'Wi-Sik Kim', 'Myung-Joo Oh', 'Ilsu Choi', 'Sung-Ju Jung']"
Enhanced detection of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (a salmonid rhabdovirus) by pretreatment of the virus with a combinatorial library-selected peptide.,"A 17-mer peptide (SAAEASAKATAEATAKG, p5) was selected by screening a combinatorial library for its ability to enhance in vitro the infectivity of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), a salmonid rhabdovirus. Preincubation of VHSV samples with p5 at micromolar concentrations led to up to 5-fold increase of viral titers compared to untreated samples, as measured by a 1-day post-infection immunochemical focus assay. Treatment with p5 also increased VHSV titers when using the more traditional plaque and end-point dilution assays. Preincubation of p5 with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (another rhabdovirus of salmonids), but not with infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (birnavirus) also led to a similar increase in sensitivity.

In vitro assay to select rainbow trout with variable resistance/susceptibility to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.,"The merit of a candidate criterion of resistance to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) was tested with the view of producing experimental trout progeny with a predictable level of resistance. The criterion, the measure of in vitro viral replication in excised fin tissue (VREFT) was previously developed. Three experiments were performed, using both ordinary and homozygous doubled-haploid breeders. A set of 48 progeny was tested. Breeders were individually scored for repeated measures of VREFT, and the progeny were tested against VHSV (strain 07-71, serotype 1) through a waterborne challenge (5 x 10(4) pfu ml(-1) during 2 h). Analysis of repeated measures of VREFT revealed the risk of identifying 'false' resistant individuals. The highest value should be considered the most predictive of the resistance status. Survival of progeny ranged from 0 to 100% according to the group and the experiment. The survival was correlated to the mean VREFT value of the breeders in Expts 1 and 2 (R = 0.96 and 0.61 respectively), but not in Expt 3 (R = 0.36, ns) where all tested progeny were highly susceptible. Results thus indicate that viral growth in fin tissue is genetically correlated to resistance to waterborne disease and may be used to produce selected progeny, at least at the experimental scale. Possible implications of the relationship between VREFT and resistance for the study of resistance mechanisms are discussed.",[],"['Edwige Quillet', 'Michel Dorson', 'Gérard Aubard', 'Corinne Torhy']"
Proliferation and transmission patterns of Pasteurella multocida B:2 in goats.,"This report describes the proliferation and transmission patterns of Pasteurella multocida B:2 among stressful goats, created through dexamethasone injections. Thirty seven clinically healthy adult goats were divided into three groups consisted of 15 goats in group A, 11 goats in group B and the remaining 11 in group C. At the start of the study, all goats of group A were exposed intranasally to 1.97 x 10(10) CFU/ml of live P multocida B:2. Dexamethasone was immediately administered intramuscularly for 3 consecutive days at a dosage rate of 1 mg/kg. The exposed goats were observed for signs of HS for a period of 1 month. At the end of the 1-month period, 11 goats from group B were introduced into and commingled with the surviving goats of group A before all goats from both groups were immediately injected intramuscularly with dexamethasone for 3 consecutive days. The treatment with dexamethasone was then carried out at monthly interval throughout the 3-month study period. Goats of group C were kept separately as negative control. Three surviving goats from each group were killed at 2-week interval for a complete post-mortem examination. Two (13%) goats of group A were killed within 24 hours after intranasal exposure to P multocida B:2 while another two (13%) goats from the same group were killed on day 40, approximately 10 days after the second dexamethasone injection. All four goats showed signs and lesions typical of haemorrhagic septicaemia. Bacteraemia was detected in 3 goats of group A that were having rectal temperature higher than 41degrees C. The P. multocida B:2 isolation pattern was closely associated with dexamethasone injections when significantly (p < 0.05) higher rate of isolations from both groups were observed after each dexamethasone injection. Transmission of P multocida B:2 from goats of group A to group B was successful when P multocida B:2 was isolated from goats of group B for a period of 28 days.

Infection trials showed that the three VHSV isolates were pathogenic for turbot fingerlings by i.p. injection at both temperatures, with high levels of mortality. Virus was recovered from most pools of dead fish i.p. challenged, but not from surviving fish. Although clinical signs were not induced following waterborne exposure, viral growth was obtained from some pools of surviving fish challenged by immersion with strain GH40 from Greenland halibut, which indicates that the virus can survive in sea water and infect other fish via horizontal transmission. Furthermore, although low, the clinical signs and mortality observed in fish cohabitating with turbot challenged with strain GH40 confirms horizontal transmission and indicates that the passage through fish increases the virulence of this strain for turbot. These findings indicate that Greenland halibut, as other wild fish, may play an important role in the epizootiology of VHSV and suggest a potential risk for the turbot farming industry.",[],"['C López-Vázquez', 'C P Dopazo', 'J L Barja', 'I Bandín']"
Improving Smallholder Farmer Biosecurity in the Mekong Region Through Change Management.,"Transboundary animal diseases including foot-and-mouth disease and haemorrhagic septicaemia remain a major constraint for improving smallholder large ruminant productivity in the Mekong region, producing negative impacts on rural livelihoods and compromising efforts to reduce poverty and food insecurity. The traditional husbandry practices of smallholders largely exclude preventive health measures, increasing risks of disease transmission. Although significant efforts have been made to understand the social aspects of change development in agricultural production, attention to improving the adoption of biosecurity has been limited. This study reviews smallholder biosecurity risk factors identified in the peer-reviewed literature and from field research observations conducted in Cambodia and Laos during 2006-2013, considering these in the context of a change management perspective aimed at improving adoption of biosecurity measures. Motivation for change, resistance to change, knowledge management, cultural dimensions, systems theory and leadership are discussed. Due to geographical, physical and resource variability, the implementation of biosecurity interventions suitable for smallholders is not a 'one size fits all'. Smallholders should be educated in biosecurity principles and empowered to make personal decisions rather than adopt prescribed pre-defined interventions. Biosecurity interventions should be aligned with smallholder farmer motivations, preferably offering clear short-term risk management benefits that elicit interest from smallholders. Linking biosecurity and disease control with improved livestock productivity provides opportunities for sustainable improvements in livelihoods. Participatory research and extension that improves farmer knowledge and practices offers a pathway to elicit sustainable broad-scale social change. However, examples of successes need to be communicated both at the 'evidence-based level' to influence regional policy development and at the village or commune level, with 'champion farmers' and 'cross-visits' used to lead local change. The adoption of applied change management principles to improving regional biosecurity may assist current efforts to control and eradicate transboundary diseases in the Mekong region.","['cattle', 'intervention', 'livestock', 'socioeconomic', 'uptake and adoption']","['J R Young', 'S Evans-Kocinski', 'R D Bush', 'P A Windsor']"
Transcriptome analysis of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) head kidney infected with moderate and high virulent strains of infectious viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV).,"Olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) is one of the most valuable marine aquatic species in South Korea and faces tremendous exposure to the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). Given the growing importance of flounder, it is therefore essential to understand the host defense of P. olivaceus against VHSV infection, but studies on its immune mechanism are hindered by the lack of genomic resources. In this study, the P. olivaceus was infected with disease-causing VHSV isolates, ADC-VHS2012-11 and ADC-VHS2014-5 which showed moderate virulent (20% mortality) and high virulent (65% mortality), in order to investigate the effect of difference in pathogenicity in head kidney during 1, 3, 7 days of post-infection using Illumina sequencing. After removing low-quality sequences, we obtained 144,933,160 high quality reads from thirty-six libraries which were further assembled into 53,384 unigenes with an average length of 563 bp with a range of 200 to 9605 bp. Transcriptome annotation revealed that 30,475 unigenes with a cut-off e-value of 10<sup>-5</sup> were functionally annotated. In total, 10,046 unigenes were clustered into 26 functional categories by searching against the eggNOG database, and 22,233 unigenes to 52 GO terms. In addition, 12,985 unigenes were grouped into 387 KEGG pathways. Among the 13,270 differently expressed genes, 6578 and 6692 were differentially expressed only in moderate and high virulent, respectively. Based on our sequence analysis, many candidate genes with fundamental roles in innate immune system including, pattern recognition receptors (TLRs & RLRs), Mx, complement proteins, lectins, and cytokines (chemokines, IFN, IRF, IL, TRF) were differentially expressed. Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis for these genes revealed gene response to defense response to virus, apoptotic process and transcription factor activity. In summary, this study identifies several putative immune pathways and candidate genes deserving further investigation in the context of novel gene discovery, gene expression and regulation studies and lays the foundation for fish immunology especially in P. olivaceus against VHSV.","['Head kidney', 'Olive flounder', 'Paralichthys olivaceus', 'Transcriptome', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)']","['Jee Youn Hwang', 'Kesavan Markkandan', 'Mun Gyeong Kwon', 'Jung Soo Seo', 'Seung-Il Yoo', 'Seong Don Hwang', 'Maeng-Hyun Son', 'Junhyung Park']"
Global spread and evolution of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is a rhabdovirus that infects over 48 species of teleosts and is lethal in many. VHSV threatens marine and aquatic fisheries. VHSV was first discovered outside Europe in 1988 in fish from the Pacific coast of North America. In 1994, VHSV was discovered in Newfoundland. In 2003, VHSV was isolated from fish in Lake St. Clair (Michigan and Ontario). In this study, we used 46 nucleotide sequences for the glycoprotein gene from 12 studies and 150 nucleotide sequences for the nucleoprotein gene from nine studies. We combined phylogenetics and a geographic information system to visualize the transmission paths of VHSV lineages. We also reconstructed the spread of VHSV lineages through optimization of geographic data for viral isolates on phylogenetic trees. We demonstrate that VHSV was transmitted from the North Atlantic Ocean and/or Baltic Sea to the Atlantic coast of North America and Japan in independent events. From the Atlantic coast, the virus was transmitted independently to the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Pacific coast of Canada and the contiguous United States. From the Pacific Northwest, the virus was transmitted to Asia and Alaska in independent events. These results clarify the debate ongoing in the literature on the geographic spread of VHSV.",[],"['J Studer', 'D A Janies']"
Isolation of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus from Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides caught at the Flemish Cap.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was isolated from apparently healthy Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides caught in the Flemish Cap, a deep fishing ground in the North Atlantic Ocean in international waters near Newfoundland. The identity of the virus was confirmed by electron microscopy, immunodot, seroneutralization and reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction. In the serology assays, all isolates reacted in the immunodot assay with a polyclonal antiserum against the European VHSV Type Strain F1, and were neutralized by the same antiserum, although most of the strains showed low or moderate neutralization titers. None of the isolates were detected by immunofluorescence using a specific monoclonal antibody against a nucleocapsid-related protein of VHSV F1. This is the first report of VHSV isolated from wild Greenland halibut, which represents a new host species for the virus, and it is also the first evidence of VHSV in a location close to the Atlantic coast of North America. This isolation indicates that VHSV is more widely distributed than has been thought, and appears to support a marine origin of this virus.",[],"['C P Dopaz', 'I Bandín', 'C López-Vazquez', 'J Lamas', 'M Noya', 'J L Barja']"
Outbreak of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) in seawater-farmed rainbow trout in Norway caused by VHS virus Genotype III.,"We describe the finding of a novel viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) Genotype III strain that caused disease of both a neurological and septicaemic nature in seawater-farmed rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in Storfjorden, Norway. In November 2007, an outbreak of VHS associated with slightly elevated mortality was confirmed at a seawater site rearing rainbow trout (90 to 440 g). Within 3 to 4 mo, the disease was recognised in 3 neighbouring sea sites with ongrowing rainbow trout. The clinical, gross pathological and histopathological findings were in accordance with VHS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of VHSV in brain and internal tissues by immunohistochemistry, cell culture and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Sequence analysis of the G-gene revealed that the isolated virus clustered with VHSV Genotype III and that the Norwegian isolate represents a unique strain of VHSV. The pathogenicity of the virus strain to rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon Salmo salar was examined using infection experiments. In immersion trials, the Norwegian isolate produced a cumulative mortality of 70% in rainbow trout, while nearly 100% mortality was obtained after intraperitoneal injection of the virus. For Atlantic salmon, no mortality was observed in immersion trials, whereas 52% mortality was observed after intraperitoneal injection. The Norwegian isolate thus represents the first VHSV of Genotype III pathogenic to rainbow trout.",[],"['O B Dale', 'I Ørpetveit', 'T M Lyngstad', 'S Kahns', 'H F Skall', 'N J Olesen', 'B H Dannevig']"
Zebrafish fin immune responses during high mortality infections with viral haemorrhagic septicemia rhabdovirus. A proteomic and transcriptomic approach.,"Despite rhabdoviral infections being one of the best known fish diseases, the gene expression changes induced at the surface tissues after the natural route of infection (infection-by-immersion) have not been described yet. This work describes the differential infected versus non-infected expression of proteins and immune-related transcripts in fins and organs of zebrafish Danio rerio shortly after infection-by-immersion with viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).Two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis detected variations on the protein levels of the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and cytoskeleton components but it detected very few immune-related proteins. Differential expression of immune-related gene transcripts estimated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction arrays and hybridization to oligo microarrays showed that while more transcripts increased in fins than in organs (spleen, head kidney and liver), more transcripts decreased in organs than in fins. Increased differential transcript levels in fins detected by both arrays corresponded to previously described infection-related genes such as complement components (c3b, c8 and c9) or class I histocompatibility antigens (mhc1) and to newly described genes such as secreted immunoglobulin domain (sid4), macrophage stimulating factor (mst1) and a cluster differentiation antigen (cd36).The genes described would contribute to the knowledge of the earliest molecular events occurring in the fish surfaces at the beginning of natural rhabdoviral infections and/or might be new candidates to be tested as adjuvants for fish vaccines.",[],"['Paloma Encinas', 'Miguel A Rodriguez-Milla', 'Beatriz Novoa', 'Amparo Estepa', 'Antonio Figueras', 'Julio Coll']"
Possible role of LTB4 in the antiviral activity of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) leukocyte-derived supernatants against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) blood leukocyte-derived supernatants were tested for antiviral activity against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). The assays were performed by quantifying the effect of the supernatants on the replication of VHSV in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) cell line, RTG-2. Supernatants were obtained by incubating the leukocytes for 17 h at 18 degrees C in L-15 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Testing of leukocyte supernatants indicated that antiviral activity against VHSV resulted in a viral titer reduction of 72.1%. After the supernatants were extracted with calcium ionophore A23187 treatment, the antiviral activity significantly increased, resulting in a viral titer reduction of 99.9%. In order to determine the nature of this antiviral activity, supernatants were produced from leukocytes treated for 17 h with inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis, reactive oxygen intermediates and nitric oxide (NO) production. None of the inhibitors significantly suppressed the supernatant antiviral activity. The presence of oxygen radicals and NO was measured in the case of co-cultures of leukocytes and RTG-2 cells, but no significant differences were found in the VHSV-infected co-cultures compared to non-infected controls. Since previous work demonstrated that leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was present in turbot blood leukocyte-derived supernatants, we assessed the effect of the VHSV in vitro infection on turbot leukocyte LTB4 production by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The levels of LTB4 were significantly increased in the supernatants after VHSV infection. Furthermore, exogenous LTB4 significantly inhibited VHSV replication in RTG-2 cells. These findings suggest that LTB4 may play a significant role in VHSV replication.",[],"['Carolina Tafalla', 'Antonio Figueras', 'Beatriz Novoa']"

An outbreak of VHSV (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus) infection in farmed Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus in Japan.,"A rhabdoviral disease occurred in farmed populations of market sized Japanese flounder (hirame) Paralichthys olivaceus in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan in 1996. The causative agent was identified as viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) based on morphological, immunological, and genetic analyses. Diseased fish that were artificially injected with a representative virus isolate showed the same pathological signs and high mortality as observed in the natural outbreak. This is the first report of an outbreak of VHSV infection in cultured fish in Japan. Clinical signs of diseased fish included dark body coloration, an expanded abdomen due to ascites, congested liver, splenomegaly, and a swollen kidney. Myocardial necrosis was most prominent and accompanied by inflammatory reactions. Necrotic lesions also occurred in the liver, spleen and hematopoietic tissue, and were accompanied by circulatory disturbances due to cardiac failure. Hemorrhagic lesions did not always appear in the lateral musculature. Transmission electron microscopy revealed many rhabdovirus particles and associated inclusion bodies containing nucleocapsids in the necrotized myocardium. The histopathological findings indicated that the necrotizing myocarditis could be considered a pathognomonic sign of VHSV infection in Japanese flounder.",[],"['T Isshik', 'T Nishizawa', 'T Kobayashi', 'T Nagano', 'T Miyazaki']"
"Viral replication in excised fin tissues (VREFT) corresponds with prior exposure of Pacific herring, Clupea pallasii (Valenciennes), to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV).","Procedures for a viral replication in excised fin tissue (VREFT) assay were adapted to Pacific herring, Clupea pallasii, and optimized both to reduce processing time and to provide the greatest resolution between naïve herring and those previously exposed to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), Genogroup IVa. The optimized procedures included removal of the left pectoral fin from a euthanized fish, inoculation of the fin with >10(5) plaque-forming units (PFU) mL(-1) VHSV for 1 h, rinsing the fin in fresh medium six times to remove unadsorbed virions, incubation of the fin in fresh medium for 4 days and enumeration of the viral titre in a sample of the incubation medium by plaque assay. The optimized VREFT assay was effective at identifying the prior exposure history of laboratory-reared Pacific herring to VHSV. The geometric mean VREFT value was significantly greater (P < 0.01) among naïve herring (1.2 × 10(3) PFU mL(-1) ) than among groups that survived exposure to VHSV (1.0-2.9 × 10(2) PFU mL(-1) ); additionally, the proportion of cultures with no detectable virus was significantly greater (P = 0.0002) among fish that survived exposure to VHSV (39-47%) than among naïve fish (3.3%).

Viral load of various tissues of rainbow trout challenged with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus at various stages of disease.,"Market-sized rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were challenged by waterborne exposure to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV isolate of genogroup Ia). Fish were sampled at 4 stages of infection (before onset of clinical signs, clinically affected fish, mortalities and survivors) and the viral load determined in (1) internal organs, (2) muscle tissue and (3) brain and gill tissue. Virus levels were determined by virus titration and real-time RT-PCR. VHSV was detected by either method in the majority of fish before onset of clinical signs and in the survivor group as well as in all fish in the clinically affected fish and mortality groups. Mean virus amounts per mg of tissue determined by virus titration (TCID50) or real-time RT-PCR (copy number) were > 10(4) in preclinical fish, > 10(3.8) in clinically affected fish, > 10(3.9) in mortalities and > 10(1.2) in survivors. Virus levels tended to be highest in the internal organs of subclinical and clinically affected fish and in brain and gill tissue of survivors. The results demonstrate that significant levels of VHSV can be found in tissues of rainbow trout that may be marketed for human consumption, which may have relevance for the biosecurity of VHS-free areas.",[],"['B Oidtmann', 'C Joiner', 'D Stone', 'M Dodge', 'R A Reese', 'P Dixon']"
A protein G fragment from the salmonid viral hemorrhagic septicemia rhabdovirus induces cell-to-cell fusion and membrane phosphatidylserine translocation at low pH.,"The fusion-related properties of segments p9, p3, p4, and p9 + p2 surrounding the p2 phospholipid-binding domain of the protein G (pG) of the salmonid rhabdovirus of viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) (Nuñez, E., Fernandez, A. M., Estepa, A., Gonzalez-Ros, J. M., Gavilanes, F., and Coll, J. M. (1998) Virology 243, 322-330; Estepa, A., and Coll, J. M. (1996) Virology 216, 60-70), have been studied at neutral and fusion (low) pH values by using its derived peptides. Cell-to-cell fusion, translocation of phosphatidylserine, and inhibition of fusion of pG-transfected cells defined the p9 + p2 (fragment 11, sequence 56-110) as a fragment with higher specific activity for anionic phospholipid aggregation than the previously reported p2. While fragment 11, p2, and p3 showed interactions with anionic phospholipids, p9 and p4 showed no interactions with any phospholipids. When added to a cell monolayer model at low pH, fragment 11 induced pH-dependent cell-to-cell fusion and translocated phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the membrane. At low pH and in the presence of anionic phospholipids, fragment 11 showed more than 80% beta-sheet conformation (IR and CD spectroscopies). Finally, anti-fragment 11 antibodies inhibited low pH-dependent pG-transfected cell-to-cell fusion. All of the data support the conclusion that fragment 11 is a primary determinant of some of the viral cell fusion events in VHSV.",[],"['A M Estepa', 'A I Rocha', 'V Mas', 'L Pérez', 'J A Encinar', 'E Nuñez', 'A Fernandez', 'J M Gonzalez Ros', 'F Gavilanes', 'J M Coll']"
Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus alters turbot Scophthalmus maximus macrophage nitric oxide production.,"The effect of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in vitro infection on the nitric oxide (NO) production by turbot Scophthalmus maximus kidney macrophages has been addressed in the past. Previously, we had determined that only a small fraction of turbot possess head kidney macrophages that respond to a single exposure of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with NO production (LPS-responsive macrophages), whereas macrophage cultures from other individuals were not activated by LPS alone and needed a combination of stimuli to respond (LPS-non-responsive macrophages). In the current work, we examined the effect of VHSV on NO production by macrophages characterized as LPS-responsive macrophages or LPS-non-responsive macrophages. Combinations of LPS and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and macrophage-activating factor (MAF) were also used to stimulate the cells for NO production. The effect of VHSV on NO production depends on the response to LPS alone. When a low multiplicity of infection was used (1.78 x 10(-3)), the NO production in response to LPS in LPS-responsive macrophages was significantly decreased. However, LPS-non-responsive macrophage cultures produced NO when a combination of LPS and VHSV was used. In the case of a higher VHSV multiplicity of infection (1.78), no significant change was observed in LPS-non-responsive animals. Combinations of LPS with TNF-alpha, LPS with MAF, and TNF-alpha with MAF were used to induce NO production in LPS-non-responsive macrophages. In all these cases, VHSV suppressed NO production, although at a significant level only when a combination of TNF-alpha and MAF was used for the induction of NO.",[],"['C Tafalla', 'A Figueras', 'B Novoa']"
Comparative immunogenecity of foot and mouth disease virus antigens in FMD-haemorrhagic septicaemia combined vaccine and FMD vaccine alone in buffalo calves.,"Humoral immune response was evaluated by monitoring the serum antibody titres and virus specific IgM titres against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) virus antigens in serum samples obtained from different groups of calves inoculated with combined vaccine or FMD vaccine alone, on 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42 and 56 days post-vaccination (DPV). The cellular immune response was monitored by MTT based lymphoproliferation in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. Higher liquid phase blocking (LPB) ELISA antibody titres were observed in calves receiving combined vaccine as compared to calves immunized with FMD vaccine alone with the peak titres in both the groups obtained on 21 days post-vaccination.

The socio-economic impact of important camel diseases as perceived by a pastoralist community in Kenya.,"This paper presents the results of a study conducted in a pastoral community in Kenya using participatory appraisal approaches. The objective of the study was to assess the socio-economic impact of camel trypanosomosis (surra) according to the perceptions of the pastoralists. Four livestock grazing units were conveniently selected and in each of them, three groups of key informants comprising five to eight persons were selected for the participatory exercises. Five camel diseases were listed in order of importance according to their severity and frequency of occurrence including trypanosomosis, mange, non-specific diarrhoea, tick infestations and haemorrhagic septicaemia. The losses listed as incurred due to the five diseases were: losses in milk, meat, blood, fats and hides, dowry payments, and depreciation in sale of animals, losses due to infertility and abortions, and losses due to the cost of treatment. There was good agreement (P < 0.05) between the informant groups on the losses incurred as a result of the diseases for all the selected loss indicators. Surra and mange were given high median scores on all the indicators while non-specific diarrhoea, tick infestations, and haemorrhagic septicaemia received moderate median scores. Based on the study findings it is concluded that the camel plays a central role in the lives of Turkana pastoralists and that surra has a devastating social and economic impact. There is a need for veterinary and policy decision-makers to focus more attention on the control of surra in this arid and semi-arid area of Kenya.",[],"['M O K Mochabo', 'P M Kitala', 'P B Gathura', 'W O Ogara', 'E M Eregae', 'T D Kaitho', 'A Catley']"

Comparative susceptibilities and immune reactions of wild and cultured populations of Caspian trout Salmo trutta caspius to VHSV.,"Caspian trout Salmo trutta caspius is an endangered subspecies of brown trout Salmo trutta which is native to the Caspian Sea. Restocking programmes have been established, but recent introduction of the rhabdovirus viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) into Iranian rainbow trout farms connected to waterbodies supporting wild Caspian trout may represent an additional threat to the declining stock. The susceptibility of wild and cultured populations of this endemic subspecies was demonstrated by performing controlled VHSV infection experiments (both by bath and injection challenges). Subsequently, VHSV infection in exposed fish was confirmed (CPE and quantitative PCR), virus levels were measured, and regulation of immune genes in exposed fish was investigated with a focus on the genes encoding IL-8, IFNγ, TGFβ, TNFα, SAA, C3-4, CD8α, IgM, MHC I, MHC II, iNOS and IGF-1. The presence of IgM-, CD8α- and MHC II-positive cells in host organs was visualized by immunohistochemistry. Both wild and cultured trout strains proved to be VHSV-susceptible following experimental challenge, but the mortality curves and associated regulation of immune-related genes differed between the 2 trout types. Implications of the results for future management of Caspian trout populations are discussed.","['Caspian trout', 'Immunity', 'Susceptibility', 'Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus']","['Asma Mohammad Karami', 'Ali Bani', 'Mohammad Pourkazemi', 'Mohades Ghasemi', 'Per Walter Kania', 'Kurt Buchmann']"
"Safety and efficacy of an oil-adjuvant vaccine against haemorrhagic septicaemia in buffalo calves: cross-protection between the serotypes B:2,5 and E:2,5.","The safety, efficacy and duration of immunity of an improved oil-adjuvant vaccine against haemorrhagic septicaemia, containing inactivated cells of Pasteurella multocida serotype B:2,5, were tested in young buffalo calves in Pakistan. For safety testing, five buffalo calves were vaccinated intramuscularly with twice the normal dose, and six weeks later with a normal dose. Except for a transient rise in rectal temperature at six hours after the vaccinations, no systemic reactions were observed. The buffaloes remained in good condition and had a normal appetite. No local reactions were observed at the injection site. For efficacy testing two trials were carried out. In the first, buffalo calves were vaccinated intramuscularly either with two doses two-and-a-half months apart, or with a single dose, or left unvaccinated. They were challenged subcutaneously with virulent P multocida after eight, 13 or 15 months. After challenge at eight months the four buffaloes given two doses and the buffalo given one dose were protected, whereas the control animal developed the typical signs of the disease. After the challenges at 13 and 15 months, the vaccinated animals were still protected whereas the control animals died. In the second trial, buffalo calves were vaccinated intramuscularly either with two doses two months apart, or with a single dose at two months or left unvaccinated. The buffaloes were challenged after eight or 14 months. After challenge at eight months the four control animals died, whereas three of the four buffaloes given a single dose were protected. After challenge at 14 months, the three control animals died, whereas four of the five buffaloes given two doses and both the buffaloes given a single dose were protected. To test for cross-protection against the heterologous serotypes E:2,5 and B:3,4, groups of mice were vaccinated once or left unvaccinated. Four weeks later, the vaccinated and control groups were challenged with a dilution series of the different challenge cultures.

Comparative studies for serodiagnosis of haemorrhagic septicaemia in cattle sera.,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by Pasteurella multocida is a major epizootic disease in cattle and buffaloes in developing countries with high morbidity and mortality rate. In the present study, a total of 88 P. multocida isolates were isolated from 256 nasopharyngeal swabs and lung tissues samples (34.4%) during the period from January, 2013 to March, 2014 from different governorates located in Egypt. Dead calves showed the highest percentage of P. multocida isolation followed by the emergency slaughtered calves, diseased calves then apparently healthy ones. These isolates were confirmed as P. multocida microscopically, biochemically by traditional tests and by API 20E commercial kit then by PCR. The percentages of positive serum samples using somatic antigen and micro-agglutination test at 1/1280 diluted serum were 10%, 54.49% and 0% in apparently healthy, diseased and emergency slaughtered samples, respectively whereas, the percentages using capsular antigen and indirect haemagglutination test were 40%, 60.89% and 60% in apparently healthy, diseased and emergency slaughtered samples, respectively. The ELISA showed the highest sensitivity for diagnosing P. multocida in apparently healthy, diseased and emergency slaughtered animals with percentages of 42%; 92.9% and 80%, respectively. The obtained results revealed that the ELISA using capsular antigen of P. multocida is a more sensitive and specific serological test for diagnosis of haemorrhagic septicaemia.

Bacteremia in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.,"Increased risk of bacterial infection is common in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Our study aimed to explore the association of the bacteremia with in-hospital mortality and risk factors of bacteremia in these patients.In our retrospective cohort study, we collected data for cirrhotic patients with UGIB admitted to our hospital between August 2010 and December 2010. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was bacteremia. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine risk factors for mortality and bacteremia.A total of 202 patients with cirrhosis presenting with UGIB at the emergency department (ED) were enrolled. Bacteremia was associated with a higher mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 9.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-50.6, p=0.007), whereas shock (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at ED triage) and bandemia (>0% immature neutrophils of band form) were associated with bacteremia in cirrhotic patients with UGIB (adjusted OR: 5.3; 95% CI: 2.3-12.7, p<0.0001 and adjusted OR: 4.0; 95% CI: 1.6-9.9, p=0.0003, respectively).Bacteremia in cirrhotic patients with UGIB is one of the major risk factors leading to in-hospital mortality. On the basis of our findings, prevention of bacteremia in cirrhotic patients with UGIB, especially in those with shock and bandemia, is important; thus, adequate antibiotic treatment is suggested.",[],"['Hsin-An Shih', 'Pei-Chuan Tsai', 'Kai-Hsiang Wu', 'Yi-Ting Chen', 'Yi-Chuan Chen']"
Role of endotoxin in the pathogenesis of haemorrhagic septicaemia in the buffalo.,"The pathogenesis of haemorrhagic septicaemia in buffalo infected with Pasteurella multocida is poorly understood. However, the characteristic of sudden onset leading to the rapid death of infected animals is similar to that seen in other clinical conditions known to involve endotoxic shock. The objectives of the work were to assess the contribution of endotoxaemia to the disease's pathogenesis and to characterize the pathophysiological reaction, including the acute phase response, of buffalo to experimental infection with P. multocida serotype B:2, the bacterium responsible for the disease in Asia. After intranasal infection of eight buffaloes with a culture of a field isolate of P. multocida serotype B:2, three animals succumbed to the disease at 26-30 h post-infection (p.i.) and five survived. Rectal temperatures of infected animals rose to a peak at about 10 h p.i. and surviving animals showed a second peak in rectal temperature at 36 h p.i. Endotoxin was present only in serum of non-surviving animals 3-5 h before death or killing during which time concentrations increased rapidly, correlating with the development of overt clinical signs and reductions in rectal temperature, concentrations of white blood cells, serum thyroxine, iron, copper and zinc, an increase in serum haptoglobin and cortisol and the detection of a low-grade bacteraemia. A strong acute phase response was maintained in surviving animals with a progressive rise in serum haptoglobin over 96 h p.ia slow rise in the serum copper concentration from 24 h p.i. and an increase, from about 65 h p.iin serum alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein. The findings demonstrate that a progressive endotoxaemia and associated sequelae correlates with the development of overt haemorrhagic septicaemia disease and sudden death in buffalo.",[],"['N U Horadagoda', 'J C Hodgson', 'G M Moon', 'T G Wijewardana', 'P D Eckersall']"

"Larval Pacific herring, Clupea pallasii (Valenciennes), are highly susceptible to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia and survivors are partially protected after their metamorphosis to juveniles.","Pacific herring were susceptible to waterborne challenge with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) throughout their early life history stages, with significantly greater cumulative mortalities occurring among VHSV-exposed groups of 9-, 44-, 54- and 76-day-old larvae than among respective control groups. Similarly, among 89-day-1-year-old and 1+year old post-metamorphosed juveniles, cumulative mortality was significantly greater in VHSV-challenged groups than in respective control groups. Larval exposure to VHSV conferred partial protection to the survivors after their metamorphosis to juveniles as shown by significantly less cumulative mortalities among juvenile groups that survived a VHS epidemic as larvae than among groups that were previously naïve to VHSV. Magnitude of the protection, measured as relative per cent survival, was a direct function of larval age at first exposure and was probably a reflection of gradual developmental onset of immunocompetence. These results indicate the potential for easily overlooked VHS epizootics among wild larvae in regions where the virus is endemic and emphasize the importance of early life history stages of marine fish in influencing the ecological disease processes.",[],"['P K Hershberger', 'J Gregg', 'C Pacheco', 'J Winton', 'J Richard', 'G Traxler']"
"In vitro and in vivo differential expression of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Mx isoforms in response to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) G gene, poly I:C and VHSV.","Three different Mx isoforms are known to be present in rainbow trout, however, to date, neither their mechanism of action nor their regulation have been established. Because most previous studies have focused only on one Mx isoform of the three present in rainbow trout, the expression of all isoforms was simultaneously studied in this work in response to the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) G gene, poly I:C or VHSV. Thus, RT-PCR assays were specifically designed to amplify each of the Mx1, Mx2 and Mx3 transcripts induced both in vitro (RTG-2 cell line and head kidney leucocytes) and in vivo (muscle, head kidney, spleen and liver). Regardless of the inducer used, in vitro results showed that while in RTG-2 cells Mx3 was predominantly induced, all three isoforms were similarly induced in head kidney leukocytes. In vivo, regardless of the inducer used a predominant expression of Mx3 transcripts was also observed in muscle but expression of all three Mx isoforms or predominantly Mx1 and Mx2 was found in head kidney and spleen. Mx expression in the liver was however more dependent on the inducer used. In conclusion, the results obtained demonstrated, for the first time, that both in vitro and in vivo the expression of the different Mx genes is differentially regulated. Moreover, this is also the first report showing Mx induction after cell transfection with a plasmid coding for the VHSV-G protein.",[],"['C Tafalla', 'V Chico', 'L Pérez', 'J M Coll', 'A Estepa']"
"Survival of the North American strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in filtered seawater and seawater containing ovarian fluid, crude oil and serum-enriched culture medium.","The North American strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (NA-VHSV) could be recovered for up to 40 h in natural filtered seawater (27 ppt) with a 50% loss of infectivity after approximately 10 h at 15 degrees C. Addition of 10 ppb North Slope crude oil to the seawater had no effect on virus survival. However, when various concentrations of teleost ovarian fluid were added to seawater, virus could be recovered after 72 h at 0.01% ovarian fluid and after 96 h at 1.0%. When cell culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the seawater, 100% of the virus could be recovered for the first 15 d and 60% of the virus remained after 36 d. These findings quantify NA-VHSV infectivity in natural seawater and demonstrate that ovarian fluid, which occurs naturally during spawning events, significantly prolongs the survival and infectivity of the virus.

Development of a multiplex assay to measure the effects of shipping and storage conditions on the quality of RNA used in molecular assays for detection of viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus.,"Abstract In routine diagnostics, real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has become a powerful method for fish health screening. Collection, transportation, and storage conditions of specimens could dramatically affect their integrity and could consequently affect RT-qPCR test results. In this study, to assess the expression profile of elongation factor 1 alpha (ELF-1α) gene, head kidney (HK) tissues from Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar were exposed at room temperature, 4°C, -20°C, and -80°C as well as in 70% ethanol for 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. Data showed a significant increase of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for ELF-1α ranging from 14.7 to 26.5 cycles for tissues exposed to room temperature. In order to mimic the sample transportation conditions, different temperatures of storage were used and tissue quality was evaluated using ELF-1α gene expression. Data showed that Ct values for ELF-1α increased significantly when the tissues were transported on ice for 2 h, stored at -20°C, thawed on ice for 6 h, and stored again at -80°C. The HK tissues collected from Atlantic Salmon challenged with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) through intraperitoneal injection were exposed at room temperature for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Data showed a good correlation of values for ELF-1α and VHSV Ct although the ELF-1α mRNA of the host degraded faster than the RNA of VHSV. Based on these data, HK tissues could be transported on ice or ice packs without the quality of the tissue being affected when stored at -80°C upon arrival at the laboratory. In addition, 70% ethanol could be used as a preservative for long-distance transportation. For an efficient diagnostic test, a duplex VHSV-ELF-1α was developed and optimized. Data showed that the sensitivity of the duplex assay for VHSV was similar to the singleplex. Received November 25, 2013; accepted February 14, 2014.

Detection of rainbow trout antibodies against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) by neutralisation test is highly dependent on the virus isolate used.,"Three serological tests, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 50% plaque neutralisation test (50%PNT) and Western blotting (WB), were used to detect antibodies against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in 50 rainbow trout broodstock from a rainbow trout farm endemically infected with VHS but with no clinical signs of infection. When the sera were examined by 50%PNT using the VHSV reference isolate DK-F1 or the heat attenuated DK-F25 mutant strain, no neutralizing antibodies were found. In contrast, when one of the virus isolates from the farm (homologous virus) was used in the 50%PNT, 90% of the fish were found to be positive. By examining a panel of different VHSV isolates in 50%PNT, it was demonstrated that the virus isolate used as test antigen could significantly affect the sensitivity and titre determination in 50%PNT for detection of rainbow trout antibodies against VHSV. When the sera were examined for the presence of VHSV antibodies by ELISA or WB, 61% were found to be positive.

Typing of Pasteurella multocida from haemorrhagic septicaemia in Danish fallow deer (Dama dama).,"Isolates of Pasteurella multocida ssp. multocida (n = 31) from a Danish population of fallow deer which succumbed to haemorrhagic septicaemia during 1992 1993 and isolates from the palatine tonsils of apparently healthy fallow deer from the same area (n=6) were typed and compared with P. multocida from other sources. Plasmids were net observed in the fallow deer strains and one unique pattern was observed by ribotyping using HindIII and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using SanlI as restriction endonuclease. All Danish fallow deer isolates belonged to serotype B:3,4. On restriction endonuclease analysis using HhaI as restriction endonuclease, all had a profile identical to that of a fallow deer isolate from the United Kingdom: profile 0033 of Wilson et al. On restriction endonuclease analysis using HpaII as restriction endonuclease, the Danish fallow deer isolates had a unique profile, designated 0062, which differed slightly from that of a fallow deer isolate from the United Kingdom. P. multocida from other animal species were genotypically different from the fallow deer isolates. It is concluded that a specific clone of P. multocida was responsible for the outbreak of haemorrhagic septicaemia among Danish fallow deer.

[Detection of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction. Diagnostic validation].,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is a fish pathogen that attacks rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farming. The only diagnostic method recognised by the European community for VHS is based on the detection of the viral agent in cell culture followed by an immunological identification of the pathogen. Reverse transcription followed by a double amplification of the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the gene encoding the viral glycoprotein G is proposed here as an alternative method to the virus assay in cell culture. The RT-PCR was found to have three advantages over the viral assay method. First, the RT-PCR was found to be more rapid than the virus assay method (24 h compared to 72-120 h). Second, this method was found to be more sensitive than the virus assay (2.10(-2) pfu of virus were detected per millilitre of viral suspension compared to 2.10(-1) pfu.mL-1 by inoculation of the cell lines EPC and RTG2). Third, the RT-PCR was shown to be specific towards the VHS virus assay (represented by its four serotypes VHS I, VHS II, VHS 23/75 and VHS IV). Moreover no amplification was obtained with the other rhabdoviruses used: infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (American strain Amend 72, WRAC, RB, SRVC) and French reference strain 69/87, eel viruses, spring viraemia of carp virus and pike fry virus. The validation of this method was performed on organs removed from experimentally infected rainbow trout and ovarian fluid samples from farmed broodfish from D0 to D150. By using RT-PCR between D30 and D60, 13 samples from nine experimentally infected trout (ten kidney-spleen pools and three brains) tested positive, whereas only nine samples (four kidney-spleen pools and five brains) from six fish were positive at D30. The last positive response was obtained by RT-PCR at D60 for kidney-spleen pools from three fish. At D150, all the results were negative. From the 60 ovarian fluid samples tested, 28 were VHS positive by the RT-PCR versus 15 by the virus assay method. Eleven out of the 60 broodfish had neutralised anti-VHS, six were negative by RT-PCR and by the virus assay, four were positive by RT-PCR and negative by virus assay and one positive by both methods. The specificity, sensitivity and rapidity of the RT-PCR method makes it an attractive alternative to classical virological methods currently recommended by European Fish Health Surveillance Programmes.",[],"['J P Guillou', 'G Merle', 'S Hénault', 'A M Hattenberger']"
Interferon-induced protein 56 (IFI56) is induced by VHSV infection but not by bacterial infection in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).,"Interferon-inducible protein 56 (IFI56, also known as ISG56/IFIT1, interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) is strongly induced in response to interferon and a potent inhibitor of viral replication and translational initiation. Here, we describe the identification of IFI56 (OfIFI56) in olive flounder, its characteristic features, and expression levels in various tissues before and after viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection. The full-length OfIFI56 sequence was identified from rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR. The complete coding sequence of OfIFI56 is 1971 bp in length and encodes 431 amino acids. The putative OfIFI56 protein has multiple tetratricopeptide (TPR) motifs, which regulate diverse biological processes, such as organelle targeting, protein import, and vesicle fusion. Based on sequence analysis, the Larimichthys crocea IFI56 protein (61%) had the highest sequence homology to OfIFI56. In healthy olive flounder, OfIFI56 mRNA expression was detected in many tissues such as intestine, gill, head kidney, heart, spleen, and trunk kidney tissues. After VHSV challenge, OfIFI56 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in these tissues. Additionally, OfIFI56 expression was induced by poly I:C but not by Streptococcus parauberis and S. iniae infection or lipopolysaccharide injection in kidney and spleen tissues of olive flounder. These results demonstrate that piscine OfIFI56 expression is not induced by bacterial infection but is selectively induced by viral infection, especially VHSV, and that OfIFI56 may play an important role in the host response against VHSV infection.","['Interferon', 'Interferon-induced protein 56', 'Olive flounder', 'Tissue expression', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Jee Youn Hwang', 'Sang Jung Ahn', 'Mun-Gyeong Kwon', 'Jung Soo Seo', 'Seong Don Hwang', 'Maeng-Hyun Son']"
High virulence differences among phylogenetically distinct isolates of the fish rhabdovirus viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus are not explained by variability of the surface glycoprotein G or the non-virion protein Nv.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is an important viral pathogen in European rainbow trout farming. Isolates from wild marine fish and freshwater trout farms show highly different virulence profiles: isolates from marine fish species cause little or no mortality in rainbow trout following experimental waterborne challenge, whilst challenge with rainbow trout isolates results in high levels of mortality. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed that the highly virulent trout-derived isolates from freshwater farms have evolved from VHSV isolates from marine fish host species over the past 60 years. Recent isolates from rainbow trout reared in marine zones show intermediate virulence. The present study aimed to identify molecular virulence markers that could be used to classify VHSV isolates according to their ability to cause disease in rainbow trout. By a reverse genetics approach using a VHSV-related novirhabdovirus [infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV)], four chimaeric IHNV-VHSV recombinant viruses were generated. These chimaeric viruses included substitution of the IHNV glyco- (G) or non-structural (Nv) protein with their counterparts from either a trout-derived or a marine VHSV strain. Comparative challenge experiments in rainbow trout fingerlings revealed similar levels of survival induced by the recombinant (r)IHNV-VHSV chimaeric viruses regardless of whether the G or Nv genes originated from VHSV isolated from a marine fish species or from rainbow trout. Interestingly, recombinant IHNV gained higher virulence following substitution of the G gene with those of the VHSV strains, whilst the opposite was the case following substitution of the Nv genes.

Development of a monoclonal antibody against the CD3ε of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and its application in evaluating immune response related to CD3ε.,"The T cell receptor (TCR) is the binding site of antigen and is responsible for specifically activating the adaptive immune response. CD3, an essential component of the CD3-TCR complex, is known to be composed of γδ and ε chains in teleost. However, there are few monoclonal antibodies (mAb) available to identify these molecules on T cells, so we aimed to produce a mAb against CD3ε to improve our understanding of T cell immune response in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). CD3ε recombinant protein was expressed in yeast, the expression of which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and Western blot analysis. A CD3ε-specific mAb 4B2 was selected, the specificity of which was examined by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and RT-PCR, and the mAb was subsequently used to examine the CD3ε lymphocyte population in several different immune organs, with relatively high percentages of these cells seen in trunk-kidney and spleen, while lower percentages were seen in the liver and peripheral blood of olive flounder. During a viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection in olive flounder, the number of CD3ε lymphocytes was seen to gradually increase in the liver, spleen and trunk-kidney of infected fish until 7 days post infection (dpi). In peripheral blood, on the other hand, the increase in CD3ε lymphocyte numbers peaked by 3 dpi. These results suggest that CD3ε lymphocytes might be involved in the immune response against VHSV.","['CD3ε lymphocyte', 'Immune response', 'Monoclonal antibody', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus']","['Jae Wook Jung', 'Jung Seok Lee', 'Young Rim Kim', 'Se Pyeong Im', 'Si Won Kim', 'Jassy Mary S Lazarte', 'Jaesung Kim', 'Kim D Thompson', 'Jong Pyo Suh', 'Tae Sung Jung']"
Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) outbreaks in Finnish rainbow trout farms.,"In Finland, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) was diagnosed for the first time in 2000 from 4 rainbow trout farms in brackish water. Since then the infection has spread and, by the end of 2004, VHSV had been isolated from 24 farms in 3 separate locations: 2 in the Baltic Sea and 1 in the Gulf of Finland. The pathogenicity of 3 of these isolates from 2 separate locations was analysed in infection experiments with rainbow trout fry. The cumulative mortalities induced by waterborne and intraperitoneal challenge were approximately 40 and 90 %, respectively. Pair-wise comparisons of the G and NV gene regions of Finnish VHSV isolates collected between 2000 and 2004 revealed that all isolates were closely related, with 99.3 to 100% nucleotide identity, which suggests the same origin of infection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were closely related to the old freshwater isolates from rainbow trout in Denmark and to one old marine isolate from cod in the Baltic Sea, and that they were located close to the presumed ancestral source. As the Finnish isolates induce lower mortality than freshwater VHSV isolates in infection experiments, they could represent an intermediate stage of marine isolates evolving towards pathogenicity in rainbow trout.",[],"['Marianne Raja-Halli', 'Tuija K Vehmas', 'Eija Rimaila-Pärnänen', 'Sanna Sainmaa', 'Helle Frank Skall', 'Niels Jørgen Olesen', 'Hannele Tapiovaara']"

Endotoxin injection caused a rapid onset of clinical signs characterised by dullness, sternal recumbency, elevated rectal temperatures, excessive salivation and dyspnoea that lasted for up to 12 hours post-inoculation (p.i.). Serum concentrations of tnfalpha rose within 1 hour p.i. to reach peak values ranging between 8 and 140 ng ml(-1) at 1-2 hours p.i. and then declined rapidly to baseline levels 3-5 hours p.i. Endotoxin injection induced other acute phase changes, including a rapid leucopenia and reductions in the serum concentrations of iron and zinc and a delayed but prolonged increase in haptoglobin from 12 hours p.i. that reached a plateau from about 60 hours p.i.

Time-Dependent Production of Endothelium-Related Biomarkers is Affected Differently in Hemorrhagic and Septic Shocks.,"Shock is associated with inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine time-dependent alteration of blood biomarkers related to endothelial function in hemorrhagic and septic shocks. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by bleeding the animals. A cecal ligation and incision model was used to induce septicemia. Resuscitation was carried out by infusion of lactated Ringer's solution. Resuscitation extended survival time in both shock groups. Blood pressure increased by resuscitation in the hemorrhagic shock but not in the septic shock. While hemorrhage caused a decrease in plasma levels of nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels were increased. Only NO and TAC levels at the late phase were reversed by resuscitation. On the other hand, plasma levels of NO, ADMA, and TAC were increased by septicemia and resuscitation did not alter the septicemia-induced increase. These results indicate that blood biomarkers related to endothelial function were differentially affected by hemorrhage and septicemia. The time scale of biomarker production should be taken into consideration for the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these life-threatening diseases.","['ADMA', 'H2S', 'NO', 'TAC', 'hemorrhagic shock', 'septic shocks']","['Cenk Nuri Coskun', 'Suzan Emel Usanmaz', 'Vahide Savci', 'Emine Demirel-Yilmaz']"

A rapid, accurate and sensitive quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was developed, targeting a conserved region of the nucleoprotein (N) gene of the virus. The qRT-PCR assay was shown to be more sensitive than the conventional VHSV RT-PCR. A validation protocol included several different virus isolates as the target and confirmed that the assay could detect all European VHSV genotypes (I, II and III). Both endogenous and exogenous controls were designed to control for integrity of template and distinguish between true VHSV positives and contamination with the positive control material. In total, the universal European VHSV qRT-PCR assay with exogenous positive control was applied to screen 2040 individual Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and 150 individual rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. No evidence of the presence of VHSV in association with either salmonid species in Scottish marine farms was detected. However, both marine Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout are still considered possible carriers of VHSV, which remains a potential threat to freshwater farming.

The 16S rRNA gene sequences of these isolates were also found monophyletic with type B reference strain NCTC 10323 of P. multocida subsp. multocida.

Pasteurella multocida: diseases and pathogenesis.,"Pasteurella multocida is an enigmatic pathogen. It is remarkable both for the number and range of specific disease syndromes with which it is associated, and the wide range of host species affected. The pathogenic mechanisms involved in causing the different syndromes are, for the most part, poorly understood or completely unknown. The biochemical and serological properties of some organisms responsible for quite different syndromes appear to be similar. Thus, the molecular basis for host predilection remains unknown. The recent development of genetic manipulation systems together with the availability of multiple genome sequences should help to explain the association of particular pathological conditions with particular hosts as well as helping to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms.",[],"['I W Wilkie', 'M Harper', 'J D Boyce', 'B Adler']"
"Characterization of intramolecular disulfide bonds and secondary modifications of the glycoprotein from viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, a fish rhabdovirus.","Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infections cause high losses in cultured rainbow trout in Europe. Attempts to produce a recombinant vaccine based on the transmembrane glycoprotein (G protein) have indicated that proper folding is important for the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the protein. The present study was initiated to identify the disulfide bonds and other structural aspects relevant to vaccine design. The N-terminal amino acid residue was identified as being a pyroglutamic acid, corresponding to Gln21 of the primary transcript. Peptides from endoproteinase-degraded G protein were analyzed by mass spectrometry before and after chemical reduction, and six disulfide bonds were identified: Cys29-Cys339, Cys44-Cys295, Cys90-Cys132, Cys172-Cys177, Cys195-Cys265, and Cys231-Cys236. Mass spectrometric analysis in combination with glycosidases allowed characterization of the glycan structure of the G protein. Three of four predicted N-linked oligosaccharides were found to be predominantly biantennary complex-type structures. Furthermore, an O-linked glycan near the N terminus was identified. Alignment of the VHSV G protein with five other rhabdovirus G proteins indicates that eight cysteine residues are situated at conserved positions. This finding suggests that there might be some common disulfide bonding pattern among the six rhabdoviruses.",[],"['K Einer-Jensen', 'T N Krogh', 'P Roepstorff', 'N Lorenzen']"
Restriction endonuclease analysis using Hhal and Hpall to discriminate among group B Pasteurella multocida associated with haemorrhagic septicaemia.,"The purpose of this study was to improve and standardise restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) for discriminating isolates of serogroup B Pasteurella multocida associated with haemorrhagic septicaemia in wild and domestic animals and to create a reference database that can be used for epidemiological studies. Two techniques for extraction and isolation of chromosomal DNA were compared, a DNAzol method and an enzymic lysis followed by a two-phase partition method. No differences were observed between DNA fingerprint profiles with either technique; however, the former technique was faster and easier to perform. P. multocida isolated from different animals in different countries representing serotypes B:2, B:3, B:3,4 and B:4 were subjected to REA with HhaI and HpaII endonucleases. Forty-eight fingerprint profiles were distinguished among 222 isolates when only HhaI was used. By combining the data from REA with HhaI and HpaII used separately, 88 different groups could be distinguished among the same isolates. Following digestion with HhaI and electrophoresis, the DNA of all serotype B:2 isolates produced fingerprint profiles characterised by two trailing bands at approximately 8.4-7.1 kb which have not been observed in any other serotypes of P. multocida. Passage of three serotype B:2 isolates on laboratory media or two serotype B:2 isolates through mice did not result in a change of DNA fingerprint profile detectable by REA. The findings with 59 isolates from Sri Lanka showed that REA was highly discriminative in determining the genetic diversity of serotype B:2 P. multocida in an area where haemorrhagic septicaemia is endemic.",[],['R B Rimler']
Isolation of the North American strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) associated with epizootic mortality in two new host species of Alaskan marine fish.,"Thousands of dead Pacific herring Clupea pallasi, Pacific hake Merluccius productus and walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma were reported in Lisianski Inlet near Pelican, Alaska, USA, on August 1, 1998.

Virological examinations of dead fish identified the North American strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) from all 3 species of fish as well as associated high virus titers and possible histopathological lesions. No other primary fish pathogens were detected and there were no apparent environmental causes for fish mortality.

Dual antiviral activity of human alpha-defensin-1 against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (VHSV): inactivation of virus particles and induction of a type I interferon-related response.,"It is well known that human alpha-defensin-1, also designated as human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1), is a potent inhibitor towards several enveloped virus infecting mammals. In this report, we analyzed the mechanism of the antiviral action of this antimicrobial peptide (AMP) on viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), a salmonid rhabdovirus. Against VHSV, synthetic HNP1 possesses two antiviral activities. The inactivation of VHSV particles probably through interfering with VHSV-G protein-dependent fusion and the inhibition of VHSV replication in target cells by up-regulating genes related to the type I interferon (IFN) response, such as Mx. Neither induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) by HNP1 nor their antiviral activity against fish rhabovirus has been previously reported. Therefore, we can conclude that besides to acting as direct effector, HNP1 acts across species and can elicit one of the strongest antiviral responses mediated by innate immune system. Since the application of vaccine-based immunization strategies is very limited, the used of chemicals is restricted because of their potential harmful impact on the environment and no antimicrobial peptides from fish that exhibit both antiviral and immunoenhancing capabilities have been described so far, HNP1 could be a model molecule for the development of antiviral agents for fish. In addition, these results further confirm that molecules that mediate the innate resistance of animals to virus may prove useful as templates for new antivirals in both human and animal health.",[],"['A Falco', 'V Mas', 'C Tafalla', 'L Perez', 'J M Coll', 'A Estepa']"
PLGA encapsulated inactivated-viral vaccine: Formulation and evaluation of its protective efficacy against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) infection in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) vaccinated by mucosal delivery routes.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), an OIE listed viral pathogen, is the etiological agent of a contagious disease, causing huge economic losses in farmed olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and significant mortalities among several other marine fish species in Korea, Japan, and China. In continuation with our previous work, where injection vaccination with inactivated VHSV mixed with squalene (as adjuvant) conferred higher protective immunity to olive flounder, the present study focused on replacing the injection route of vaccine delivery by immersion/oral route to overcome the limitations of the parenteral immunization method. Here, we encapsulated the inactivated VHSV vaccine with PLGA (poly lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PNPs-IV) and evaluated its ability to induce protective immunity in olive flounder (12.5 ± 1.5 g) by initially immunizing the fishes by immersion route followed by a booster with the same dose two weeks later with half of the fish through immersion route and other half through oral route (incorporated into fish feed). Cumulative mortalities post-challenge (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> virus/fish) with virulent VHSV-isolate, were lower in vaccinated fish and RPS of 60% and 73.3% were obtained for PNPs-IV (immersion/immersion) and PNPs-IV (immersion/oral) groups, respectively. In addition, specific (anti-VHSV) antibody titre in the fish sera, skin mucus and intestinal mucus of the immunized groups were significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced following vaccination. Furthermore, PNPs-IV immunized fish showed significant (p < 0.05) upregulation of different immune gene transcripts (IgM, IgT, pIgR, MHC-I, MHC-II, IFN-γ, and Caspase3) compared to controls, in both the systemic (kidney) and mucosal (skin and intestine) immune compartment of the host post immunization as well as post challenge. Thus it can be inferred that the adopted immunization strategy efficiently protected and transported the inactivated viral antigen to target immune organs and positively stimulated the protective immune response against VHSV in olive flounder.","['Mucosal immunity', 'Nanoencapsulation', 'PLGA', 'Paralichthys olivaceus', 'VHSV']","['Sajal Kole', 'Syed Shariq Nazir Qadiri', 'Su-Mi Shin', 'Wi-Sik Kim', 'Jehee Lee', 'Sung-Ju Jung']"
Combined DNA immunization with the glycoprotein gene of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus induces double-specific protective immunity and nonspecific response in rainbow trout.,"Glycoprotein (G) of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) contains several neutralizing epitopes. However, recombinant G protein never matches intact viral particles for immunogenicity. DNA immunization offers the possibility to deliver the antigen through the cellular machinery, thus mimicking natural infection. We constructed pCDNA gVHS and pCDNA gIHN plasmids with the G gene of VHSV and IHNV under the control of the CMV promoter, and we tested the plasmids for the accurate G protein expression prior to their use in fish immunization. Following intramuscular injection to adult rainbow trout, plasmid DNA was found inside the muscle cells shortly after injection and was still present 45 days later. mRNA of the G protein was detected in muscle tissue extracts, and the G protein was found within muscle cells at the site of injection. This resulted in the synthesis of high levels of specific neutralizing and protective antibodies. Fish injected with pCDNA gVHS and pCDNA gIHN in combination responded similarly to fish receiving one recombinant plasmid. In addition to the elicitation of a strong humoral response, DNA immunization was able to activate specialized cells of the immune system as well as nonspecific defense mechanisms, since mRNAs of MHC class II and Mx were strongly activated at the site of injection.",[],"['P Boudinot', 'M Blanco', 'P de Kinkelin', 'A Benmansour']"
Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus in marine fish and its implications for fish farming--a review.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) has, in recent decades, been isolated from an increasing number of free-living marine fish species. So far, it has been isolated from at least 48 fish species from the northern hemisphere, including North America, Asia and Europe, and fifteen different species including herring, sprat, cod, Norway pout and flatfish from northern European waters. The high number of VHSV isolations from the Baltic Sea, Kattegat, Skagerrak, the North Sea and waters around Scotland indicate that the virus is endemic in these waters. The VHSV isolates originating from wild marine fish show no to low pathogenicity to rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon, although several are pathogenic for turbot. Marine VHSV isolates are so far serologically indistinguishable from freshwater isolates. Genotyping based on VHSV G- and N-genes reveals four groups indicating the geographical origin of the isolates, with one group representing traditional European freshwater isolates and isolates of north European marine origin, a second group of marine isolates from the Baltic Sea, a third group of isolates from the North Sea, and a group representing North American isolates. Examples of possible transfer of virus from free-living marine fish to farmed fish are discussed, as are measures to prevent introduction of VHSV from the marine environment to aquaculture.",[],"['H F Skall', 'N J Olesen', 'S Mellergaard']"
Involvement of two microRNAs in the early immune response to DNA vaccination against a fish rhabdovirus.,"Mechanisms that account for the high protective efficacy in teleost fish of a DNA vaccine expressing the glycoprotein (G) of Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) are thought to involve early innate immune responses mediated by interferons (IFNs). Microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are a diverse class of small (18-22 nucleotides) endogenous RNAs that potently mediate post-transcriptional silencing of a wide range of genes and are emerging as critical regulators of cellular processes, including immune responses. We have recently reported that miR-462 and miR-731 were strongly induced in rainbow trout infected with VHSV. In this study, we analyzed the expression of these miRNAs in fish following administration of the DNA vaccine and their potential functions. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed the increased levels of miR-462, and miR-731 in the skeletal muscle tissue at the site of vaccine administration and in the liver of vaccinated fish relative to empty plasmid backbone-injected controls. The increased expression of these miRNAs in the skeletal muscle correlated with the increased levels of the type I interferon (IFN)-inducible gene Mx, type I IFN and IFN-γ genes at the vaccination site. Intramuscular injection of fish with either type I IFN or IFN-γ plasmid construct resulted in the upregulation of miR-462 and miR-731 at the site of injection, suggesting that the induction of these miRNAs is elicited by IFNs. To analyze the function of miR-462 and miR-731, specific silencing of these miRNAs using anti-miRNA oligonucleotides was conducted in poly I:C-treated rainbow trout fingerlings. Following VHSV challenge, anti-miRNA-injected fish had faster development of disease and higher mortalities than control fish, indicating that miR-462/731 may be involved in IFN-mediated protection conferred by poly I:C.

Group of mice which were immunized intranasally showed significant protection (P < 0.05) of 88% as compared to 50% protection in group of mice immunized subcutaneously. In the control group of mice, 100% mortality occurred within 48 h. of challenge.

"Epizootiology of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in Pacific herring from the spawn-on-kelp fishery in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA.","Both the prevalence and tissue titer of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) increased in Pacific herring Clupea pallasi following their introduction into net pens (pounds) used in the closed pound spawn-on-kelp (SOK) fishery in Prince William Sound, Alaska. VHSV was also found in water samples from inside and outside the SOK pounds after herring had been confined for several days; however, water samples taken near wild free-ranging, spawning herring either failed to test positive or tested weakly positive for virus. Little or no virus was found in tissue samples from free-ranging, spawning herring captured from the vicinity of the pounds, nor did the prevalence of VHSV increase following spawning as it did in impounded herring. The data indicated that increased prevalences of VHSV were correlated with confinement of herring for the closed pound SOK fishery and that infection was spread within the pounds through waterborne exposure to virus particles originating from impounded fish. In addition, pounds containing predominantly young fish had higher prevalences of VHSV, suggesting that older fish may be partially immune, perhaps as a result of previous infection with the virus. Operation of SOK pounds during spawning seasons in which young herring predominate may amplify the disease and possibly exacerbate the population fluctuations observed in wild herring stocks.",[],"['P K Hershberger', 'R M Kocan', 'N E Elder', 'T R Meyers', 'J R Winton']"

Resistance to a rhabdovirus (VHSV) in rainbow trout: identification of a major QTL related to innate mechanisms.,"Health control is a major issue in animal breeding and a better knowledge of the genetic bases of resistance to diseases is needed in farm animals including fish. The detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) will help uncovering the genetic architecture of important traits and understanding the mechanisms involved in resistance to pathogens. We report here the detection of QTL for resistance to Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia Virus (VHSV), a major threat for European aquaculture industry. Two induced mitogynogenetic doubled haploid F2 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) families were used. These families combined the genome of susceptible and resistant F0 breeders and contained only fully homozygous individuals. For phenotyping, fish survival after an immersion challenge with the virus was recorded, as well as in vitro virus replication on fin explants. A bidirectional selective genotyping strategy identified seven QTL associated to survival. One of those QTL was significant at the genome-wide level and largely explained both survival and viral replication in fin explants in the different families of the design (up to 65% and 49% of phenotypic variance explained respectively). These results evidence the key role of innate defence in resistance to the virus and pave the way for the identification of the gene(s) responsible for resistance. The identification of a major QTL also opens appealing perspectives for selective breeding of fish with improved resistance.",[],"['Eloi R Verrier', 'Michel Dorson', 'Stéphane Mauger', 'Corinne Torhy', 'Céline Ciobotaru', 'Caroline Hervet', 'Nicolas Dechamp', 'Carine Genet', 'Pierre Boudinot', 'Edwige Quillet']"

"Experimental susceptibility of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua (L.), and Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus (L.), to different genotypes of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.","Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) is a well-characterized disease of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, which has also caused economic losses in marine turbot farms in the British Isles. We have previously demonstrated that turbot, Scophthalmus maximus, are susceptible to isolates of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) that are endemic in the marine environment, highlighting a potential risk to marine aquaculture. Given the increasing interest in the intensive rearing of additional aquaculture species such as Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, and Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus, this study aimed at investigating the susceptibility of these species to VHSV. Both species were found to be largely resistant to VHS following immersion challenge with a selection of 18 isolates, representing the known marine VHSV genotypes. Only one and two VHSV-associated mortalities occurred out of a total of 1710 and 1254 halibut and cod, respectively. These findings suggest that there is a low direct risk to the development of commercial cod and halibut aquaculture from the existing endemic reservoir of VHSV. This study, coupled to field observations has, however, highlighted the fact that both species can become infected with VHSV.

Electrophoretic profiles of Pasteurella multocida isolates from animals with hemorrhagic septicemia.,"We determined that the protein profiles of 14 isolates from animals with hemorrhagic septicemia were relatively homogeneous and could be placed in 2 distinct groups on the basis of their country of origin. Such differences correlated with the serotypic properties of the individual isolates; hemorrhagic septicemia isolates of Asian and North American origin (Carter B) had a major protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa, whereas those of African origins (Carter E) had a major protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa. The possession of a major 32-kDa protein band appeared to be unique to Carter B isolates, suggesting that electrophoresis may be a useful nonserologic technique for the identification of organisms of this serotype. Other major bands with apparent molecular masses of 27, 45, and 47 kDa were shared by all strains, regardless of their serotype.

Haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccines.,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), an economically important disease of cattle and buffaloes, is caused by Pasteurella multocida (6:B). Vaccination against this disease is widely practised. Plain broth bacterins, or alum precipitated and aluminium hydroxide gel vaccines are administered twice a year since these vaccines offer an immunity of 4-6 months. Many countries use oil adjuvant vaccine (OAV), which gives both a higher degree and a longer duration of immunity up to 1 year. A double emulsion and multiple emulsion vaccine consisting of a thin viscosity have also been experimentally developed that gave an immunity parallel to OAV. Recently, a live vaccine developed from a fallow deer strain (B:3,4) has been used in Myanmar that offers an immunity for more than a year but is not free from constraints. The present review provides information on HS vaccines developed from time to time using whole bacteria or their components.

All samples were examined on cell cultures. No viruses were isolated.

The isolates were highly pathogenic by IP injection where 99-100% of the whitefish died. Using an immersion challenge the rainbow trout isolates were moderately pathogenic with approximately 20% mortality, whereas the marine isolate was virtually non-pathogenic. At the end of the experiment it was possible to isolate VHSV from survivors infected with the marine and suspected marine isolates. Because of the low infection rate in wild whitefish in Denmark, the role of whitefish in the spread of VHSV in Denmark is probably not significant.

Microcolonies of Gram-negative rods were observed in the lamina propia of gills, underneath the intestinal mucosa and randomly distributed in the renal and hepatic parenchymas. Also, emboli containing Gram-negative rods were observed in capillaries of these organs. Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida was isolated in pure culture from gills, liver and intestine. Specific immunostaining confirmed the relationship between the isolate and lesion-associated bacteria. No previous reports on this infection in sharks have been found in the literature.",[],"['V Briones', 'A Fernández', 'M Blanco', 'F Ramiro', 'M L de Vicente', 'J García', 'J L Méndez', 'J Goyache']"
Experimental infection of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus isolates from European marine and farmed fishes.,"The susceptibility of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to infection with various isolates of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) was examined. A total of 8 experiments with rainbow trout ranging from 0.6 to 6.2 g was conducted for 139 isolates originating from wild marine fishes in European waters (115 isolates), farmed turbot from Scotland and Ireland (2 isolates), and farmed rainbow trout (22 isolates). The isolates were tested by immersion and/or intraperitoneal injection either as pooled or single isolates. The isolates from wild marine fishes did not cause mortality by immersion while some of the isolates caused mortality when injected. All VHSV isolates from farmed rainbow trout caused significant mortality by immersion. Currently, pathogenicity trials are the only way to differentiate VHSV isolates from wild marine fishes and farmed rainbow trout. The 2 farmed turbot isolates did not cause mortality by immersion, supporting the view that they originated from the marine environment.",[],"['Helle Frank Skall', 'Wilhelmina J Slierendrecht', 'Julie A King', 'Niels Jørgen Olesen']"

Immunity provided by haemorrhagic septicaemia-subunit vaccine in ruminants.,"A subunit vaccine against haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), the principal killer disease in ruminants, especially cattle and carabao, in the Philippines, has been developed. Using capsules of Pasteurella multocida Group B as an active component of the vaccine, it gave solid protection against challenge with live organism in mice. An active calf protection test showed that in 24 hours, animals vaccinated with plain saline died after challenge compared to those given the subunit vaccine which survive the challenge dose. Using 104 cattle from a farm, the field trial of the HS subunit vaccine showed that the antibody titre was high for up to 14 months. A high titer is an indication of protection.",[],['F S Maslog']
Viral and bacterial septicaemic infections modulate the expression of PACAP splicing variants and VIP/PACAP receptors in brown trout immune organs.,"Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) and PACAP-Related Peptide (PRP) are structurally similar peptides encoded in the same transcripts. Their transcription has been detected not only in the brain but also in a wide range of peripheral tissues, even including organs of the immune system. PACAP exerts pleiotropic activities through G-protein coupled membrane receptors: the PACAP-specific PAC-1 and the VPAC-1 and VPAC-2 receptors that exhibit similar affinities for the Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and PACAP. Recent findings added PACAP and its receptors to the growing list of mediators that allow cross-talk between the nervous, endocrine and immune systems in fish. In this study the expression of genes encoding for PACAP and PRP, as well as VIP/PACAP receptors was studied in laboratory-reared brown trout (Salmo trutta) after septicaemic infections. Respectively Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia Virus (VHSV-Ia) or the Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia ruckeri (ser. O1 - biot. 2) were used in infection challenges. Kidney and spleen, the teleost main lymphopoietic organs, were sampled during the first two weeks post-infection. RT-qPCR analysis assessed specific pathogens burden and gene expression levels. PACAP and PRP transcription in each organ was positively correlated to the respective pathogen burden, assessed targeting the VHSV-glycoprotein or Y. ruckeri 16S rRNA. Results showed as the transcription of PACAP splicing variants and VIP/PACAP receptors is modulated in these organs during an acute viral and bacterial septicaemic infections in brown trout. These gene expression results provide clues as to how the PACAP system is modulated in fish, confirming an involvement during active immune responses elicited by both viral and bacterial aetiological agents. However, further experimental evidence is still required to fully elucidate and characterize the role of PACAP and PRP for an efficient immune response against pathogens.","['ERM', 'Functional cross-talk', 'PACAP', 'PRP', 'Salmo trutta', 'VHS', 'VIP/PACAP receptors']","['Bartolomeo Gorgoglione', 'Yamila Carpio', 'Christopher J Secombes', 'Nick G H Taylor', 'Juana María Lugo', 'Mario Pablo Estrada']"
"Development of a PCR test based on a gene region associated with the pathogenicity of Pasteurella multocida serotype B:2, the causal agent of haemorrhagic septicaemia in Asia.","We have developed a PCR assay to detect Pasteurella multocida serotype B:2, the causal agent of Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (HS) in Asia. Nucleotide sequence determination of a 16S rRNA-23S rRNA PCR product unique to B:2 strains was shown to share amino acid sequence homology with a bacteriophage Mu protein. Primers designed from this sequence when tested against a panel of isolates recovered from a wide geographical area and representing a large range of bacterial genera and species, were found to specifically amplify DNA from P. multocida, serotype B:2. Southern hybridisation confirmed the presence of this sequence in only the B:2 serotype of P. multocida, suggesting an association between bacterial virulence and the presence of bacteriophage genes in the bacterial genome. The results of this study demonstrate the potential application of PCR to the diagnosis of HS in cattle and buffalo in Asia. Application of PCR to support diagnosis of HS will greatly improve accuracy, laboratory response time, and will facilitate rational deployment of resources for controlling this disease.",[],"['S K Brickell', 'L M Thomas', 'K A Long', 'M Panaccio', 'P R Widders']"

"Mortality event in freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens from Lake Ontario, Canada, associated with viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus, type IV.","A mortality event primarily affecting freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens was noted during April and May 2005 in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, Canada. A conservative estimate of the number of dead drum was approximately 100 metric tonnes. Large numbers of dead round goby Neogobius melanostomus were also seen, as well as a few muskellunge Esox masquinongy. In the drum, there was a consistent histological pattern of variably severe panvasculitis, a necrotising myocarditis, meningoencephalitis and a segmental enteritis. Moderate numbers of bullet-shaped viral particles consistent with a rhabdovirus were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in affected heart tissue. Following primary isolation from pooled tissues on fathead minnow (FHM) cells, a morphologically similar virus, approximately 165 x 60 nm in size, was visualised. Identification of the isolate as viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was confirmed by enzyme immunoassay and by polymerase chain reaction. An appropriately sized product (468 bp) of the G-glycoprotein gene (nucleotides [nt] 340 to 807) was generated with RNA extracted from FHM cell supernatant. Analysis of a 360 nt partial glycoprotein gene sequence (nt 360 to 720) indicated a 96.4 to 97.2% nucleotide identity with known strains of North American (NA) VHSV. Analysis using Neighbour-joining distance methods assigned the isolate to the same lineage as the NA and Japanese isolates (Genogroup IV). However, there was sufficient sequence divergence from known NA VHSV isolates to suggest that this isolate may represent a distinct subgroup. The effects of ongoing mortality in freshwater drum and in multiple species during spring 2006 suggest that this newly recognised virus in the Great Lakes will have continued impact in the near future.",[],"['J S Lumsden', 'B Morrison', 'C Yason', 'S Russell', 'K Young', 'A Yazdanpanah', 'P Huber', 'L Al-Hussinee', 'D Stone', 'K Way']"
Differential effects of viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotypes IVa and IVb on gill epithelial and spleen macrophage cell lines from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"The two most prominent genotypes of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) are -I in the Northeastern Atlantic region and -IV in North America, but much more is known about the cellular pathogenesis of genotype -I than -IV. VHSV genotype -IV is divided into -IVa from the Northeast Pacific Ocean and -IVb from the Great Lakes and both of which are less virulent to rainbow trout than genotype -I. In this work, infections of VHSV-IVa and -IVb have been studied in two rainbow trout cell lines, RTgill-W1 from the gill epithelium, and RTS11 from spleen macrophages. RTgill-W1 produced infectious progeny of both VHSV-IVa and -IVb. However, VHSV-IVa was more infectious than -IVb toward RTgill-W1: -IVa caused cytopathic effect (CPE) at a lower viral titre, elicited CPE earlier, and yielded higher titres. By contrast, no CPE and no increase in viral titre were observed in RTS11 cultures infected with either genotype. Yet in RTS11 all six VHSV genes were expressed and antiviral genes, Mx2 and Mx3, were up regulated by VHSV-IVb and -IVa. However, replication appeared to terminate at the translational stage as viral N protein, presumably the most abundant of the VSHV proteins, was not detected in either infected RTS11 cultures. In RTgill-W1, Mx2 and Mx3 were up regulated to similar levels by both viral genotypes, while VHSV-IVa induced higher levels of IFN1, IFN2 and LGP2A than VHSV-IVb.",[],"['P H Pham', 'J S Lumsden', 'C Tafalla', 'B Dixon', 'N C Bols']"
Coagglutination test for identification of Pasteurella multocida associated with hemorrhagic septicemia.,"Two serogroups (B and E) of Pasteurella multocida associated with hemorrhagic septicemia in cattle were differentiated by a coagglutination test with antibody-coated staphylococci. The group antigen was soluble and heat stable. It was not detectable in unencapsulated cells or their heated extracts. Adsorbed onto human type O erythrocytes, it could be demonstrated by an indirect hemagglutination test with specific antiserum or by coagglutination with specific antibody-coated staphylococci. Antibody-coated staphylococci could detect the soluble group antigen in the plasma and liver extract of mice experimentally infected with P. multocida.

Prevalence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus in Danish marine fishes and its occurrence in new host species.,"In order to analyse the occurrence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in the marine waters around Denmark, staff from the Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research participated in 5 research cruises during 1998 to 2002 as a follow-up to 4 research cruises performed in 1996 to 1997. In total, 16,655 fish were examined virologically as 3569 samples. Forty fish species and 3 invertebrate species were represented. VHSV was isolated from 133 samples representing 8 species: herring Clupea harengus, sprat Sprattus sprattus, dab Limanda limanda, flounder Platichthys flesus, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, cod Gadus morhua, sand eel Ammodytes sp. and sand goby Pomatochistus minutus. Calculations showed that VHSV was more prevalent in the Baltic Sea in an area between Zealand and the island of Bornholm and the waters surrounding Bornholm than in the Kattegat, Skagerrak and along the North Sea coast of Denmark.

Sublethal concentrations of ichthyotoxic alga Prymnesium parvum affect rainbow trout susceptibility to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.,"Ichthyotoxic algal blooms are normally considered a threat to maricultured fish only when blooms reach lethal cell concentrations. The degree to which sublethal algal concentrations challenge the health of the fish during blooms is practically unknown. In this study, we analysed whether sublethal concentrations of the ichthyotoxic alga Prymnesium parvum affect the susceptibility of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV). During exposure to sublethal algal concentrations, the fish increased production of mucus on their gills. When fish were exposed to the algae for 12 h prior to the addition of virus, a marginal decrease in the susceptibility to VHSV was observed compared to fish exposed to VHSV without algae. If virus and algae were added simultaneously, inclusion of the algae increased mortality by 50% compared to fish exposed to virus only, depending on the experimental setup. We concluded that depending on the local exposure conditions, sublethal concentrations of P. parvum could affect susceptibility of fish to infectious agents such as VHSV.

Virulence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype III in rainbow trout.,"In general, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) isolates from marine fish species in European waters (genotypes GIb, GII and GIII) are non- to low virulent in rainbow trout. However, a VHSV isolation was made in 2007 from a disease outbreak in sea farmed rainbow trout in Norway. The isolate, named NO-2007-50-385, was demonstrated to belong to GIII. This isolate has attracted attention to assess which of the viral genome/proteins might be associated with the virulence in rainbow trout. In this study, we describe the difference of virulence in rainbow trout between the NO-2007-50-385 and 4p168 isolates as representatives of virulent and non-virulent GIII isolates, respectively. Rainbow trout were bath challenged with VHSV NO-2007-50-385 for 1 and 6 h, resulting in cumulative mortalities of 5 and 35%, respectively. No mortality was observed in the rainbow trout groups immersed with the genotype III VHSV isolate 4p168 for 1 and 6 h. The viral titre in organs from fish challenged with NO-2007-50-385 for 6 h increased more rapidly than those exposed for 1 h. By in vitro studies it was demonstrated that the final titres of VHSV DK-3592B (GI), NO-2007-50-385 and 4p168 inoculated on EPC cells were very similar, whereas when inoculated on the rainbow trout cell line RTG-2 the titre of the non-virulent 4p168 isolate was 3-4 logs below the two other VHSV isolates. Based on a comparative analysis of the entire genome of the genotype III isolates, we suggest that substitutions of amino acids in positions 118-123 of the nucleo-protein are candidates for being related to virulence of VHSV GIII in rainbow trout.",[],"['Takafumi Ito', 'Jun Kurita', 'Koh-ichiro Mori', 'Niels J Olesen']"
Identification of the functional regions of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) NV protein: Variants that improve function.,"Non-virion (NV) protein is essential for an efficient replication increasing the pathogenicity of the Salmonid novirhabdovirus (formerly IHNV), Piscine novirhabdovirus (formerly VHSV), and Hirame novirhabdovirus (HIRV). The interferon system, apoptosis, and other immune-related genes are modulated by NV to finally induce a deficient antiviral state in the cell. However, little is known about the VHSV NV regions involved in function and location. Here, eight different NV 07.71 fragments and eleven NV 07.71 mutants derived from the region between the two first α-helices have been studied in order to establish the mx and il8 transcript levels in ZF4 cells and the subcellular location. As a result, we determined that the N-terminal part of NV preserves the same ability as the wild-type (wt) NV in mx/il8 modulation and it also shares the subcellular location. Among NV mutants, some induced mx upregulation (N34A, C35A, D38A, and S40A) but maintained the il8 levels stable when compared to wt-NV in ZF4. Four NV mutants (D28A, N31A, L33A, and F37A) were not affected by the mutation and showed mx and il8 transcript levels similar to wt-NV. Surprisingly, mutants D36A, R39A, and D41A induced a stronger downregulation of both mx and il8 transcript levels than wt-NV, suggesting that a more stable structure and an improved interaction with ligands could be achieved through these mutations. Amino acids at positions 36 and 39 are conserved among known VHSV NV proteins whereas at position 41 two different amino acids have been described. To date, no natural NV proteins with alanine at positions 36, 39, and 41 have been found. In addition, wt-NV, all NV mutants, and one N-terminal NV fragment were located at cytoplasm with a characteristic pattern, which might support that cytoplasm is the site for interaction with candidate ligands such as PPM1Bb. Taken together, the data presented in this work indicated that NV function relies on the first part of the molecule and is dependent on tertiary structure rather than on the linear one. This study could lead to a better knowledge of VHSV escape from fish antiviral mechanisms as well as to future studies on immune targets.","['Functional mapping', 'NV', 'Novirhabdovirus', 'VHSV', 'il8', 'mx']","['Blanca Chinchilla', 'Eduardo Gomez-Casado']"

Red blood cells were subjected to 6 haematological tests and blood plasma to 14 biochemical tests, which provided findings on changed substrate concentrations and enzyme activities. Diseased fish, compared to healthy fish, had a significantly lower red blood cell count, and lower haematocrit and haemoglobin levels. As for the biochemical parameters, the fish had less total protein, creatinine, glucose, triacylglycerol, inorganic phosphate, total calcium and sodium, and more blood urea, nitrogen and potassium. Uric acid levels remained unchanged. Increases were recorded in the catalytic concentration of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase.

LitR is a repressor of syp genes and has a temperature-sensitive regulatory effect on biofilm formation and colony morphology in Vibrio (Aliivibrio) salmonicida.,"Vibrio (Aliivibrio) salmonicida is the etiological agent of cold water vibriosis, a disease in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that is kept under control due to an effective vaccine. A seawater temperature below 12°C is normally required for disease development. Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell density-regulated communication system that bacteria use to coordinate activities involved in colonization and pathogenesis, and we have previously shown that inactivation of the QS master regulator LitR attenuates the V. salmonicida strain LFI1238 in a fish model. We show here that strain LFI1238 and a panel of naturally occurring V. salmonicida strains are poor biofilm producers. Inactivation of litR in the LFI1238 strain enhances medium- and temperature-dependent adhesion, rugose colony morphology, and biofilm formation. Chemical treatment and electron microscopy of the biofilm identified an extracellular matrix consisting mainly of a fibrous network, proteins, and polysaccharides. Further, by microarray analysis of planktonic and biofilm cells, we identified a number of genes regulated by LitR and, among these, were homologues of the Vibrio fischeri symbiosis polysaccharide (syp) genes. The syp genes were regulated by LitR in both planktonic and biofilm lifestyle analyses. Disruption of syp genes in the V. salmonicida ΔlitR mutant alleviated adhesion, rugose colony morphology, and biofilm formation. Hence, LitR is a repressor of syp transcription that is necessary for expression of the phenotypes examined. The regulatory effect of LitR on colony morphology and biofilm formation is temperature sensitive and weak or absent at temperatures above the bacterium's upper threshold for pathogenicity.

A rapid and sensitive method to measure the functional activity of Shiga toxins in human serum.,"Shiga toxins (Stx) have a definite role in the development of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children with hemorrhagic colitis caused by pathogenic Stx-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains. The dramatic effects of these toxins on the microvasculature of different organs, particularly of the kidney, are well known, whereas there is no consensus on the mechanism by which Stx reach the endothelia of target organs and/or indirectly injure these body sites. We hereby describe a quick (4 h), radioactive, Raji cell-based method designed for the detection of Stx in human sera. The assay monitors the translation impairment induced by these powerful inhibitors of protein synthesis, which are identified properly by neutralizing their activity with specific monoclonal antibodies. By this method, we detected for the first time the functional activity of Stx in sera of STEC-infected patients during hemorrhagic colitis. Recent research has pointed to a dynamic process of Stx-induced renal intoxication in which concurrent and interactive steps are involved. Our rapid and specific method could be useful for studying the kinetics of Stx during the natural course of STEC infection and the interplay between Stx activity in serum and Stx presence in different blood fractions (neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, leukocyte-platelet aggregates, microvesicles, lipoproteins).

"Protection, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in calves immunized with multiple emulsion haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccine.","A multiple emulsion (ME), vaccine against Pasteurella multocida (P52) infection in cattle was prepared and the efficiency in terms of immunity to direct challenge, duration of this immunity for up to 1 year and the role of humoral and cell-mediated immune mechanisms were studied. ME vaccine was sterile, safe and was potent when tested in rabbits and calves. Nineteen calves were immunized with a single 4 ml dose of ME vaccine intramuscularly. Group of these calves were challenge infected with virulent P. multocida (P52) (10(-1) 18 h old broth culture) given by the subcutaneous route at 21 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year. All the immunized calves withstood challenge infection and showed 100% protection. Humoral immune response was measured by indirect haemagglutination test (IHA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Statistically ELISA values were found to be superior to IHA values because of small coefficient of variance. A fall in mean antibody titres during 24 h, 48 h, post-challenge infection was recorded whereas a steady increase in the titre after 72 h up to 10 days was noticed. The prechallenge mean titre in animals correlated with survival of animals. Humoral antibodies were detected as early as 7 day post-immunization and persisted to 1 year after immunization. Leucocyte migration inhibition test showed > 20% migration inhibition during all pre- and post-challenge periods in animals suggesting an involvement of cell-mediated immune mechanism in protection.

"Genotyping of the fish rhabdovirus, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus, by restriction fragment length polymorphisms.","The aim of this study was to develop a standardized molecular assay that used limited resources and equipment for routine genotyping of isolates of the fish rhabdovirus, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV). Computer generated restriction maps, based on 62 unique full-length (1524 nt) sequences of the VHSV glycoprotein (G) gene, were used to predict restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns that were subsequently grouped and compared with a phylogenetic analysis of the G-gene sequences of the same set of isolates. Digestion of PCR amplicons from the full-length G-gene by a set of three restriction enzymes was predicted to accurately enable the assignment of the VHSV isolates into the four major genotypes discovered to date. Further sub-typing of the isolates into the recently described sub-lineages of genotype I was possible by applying three additional enzymes. Experimental evaluation of the method consisted of three steps: (i) RT-PCR amplification of the G-gene of VHSV isolates using purified viral RNA as template, (ii) digestion of the PCR products with a panel of restriction endonucleases and (iii) interpretation of the resulting RFLP profiles. The RFLP analysis was shown to approximate the level of genetic discrimination obtained by other, more labour-intensive, molecular techniques such as the ribonuclease protection assay or sequence analysis. In addition, 37 previously uncharacterised isolates from diverse sources were assigned to specific genotypes. While the assay was able to distinguish between marine and continental isolates of VHSV, the differences did not correlate with the pathogenicity of the isolates.",[],"['Katja Einer-Jensen', 'James Winton', 'Niels Lorenzen']"
Limiting the Impacts of foot and mouth disease in large ruminants in northern Lao People's Democratic Republic by vaccination: a case study.,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is the most important global transboundary livestock disease and is endemic in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) with outbreaks occurring regularly. Lao PDR shares borders with five countries and as a major thoroughfare for transboundary livestock movement, is vulnerable to the social and economic impacts of FMD. The FMD outbreak occurred in January 2009 in the Pek District, located in the north-eastern Lao PDR province of Xieng Khuang and involved all 111 villages in that district. In March 2009, we conducted a case study on the impacts of FMD in four villages in Pek District. In two villages cattle and buffalo were vaccinated for FMD recently and prior to the outbreak as part of an ongoing research project. In one of these villages, all cattle and buffalo were vaccinated and just over half the large ruminant population was vaccinated in the other village. The other two villages involved in the case study were located nearby but not part of the ongoing research project and no animals had been vaccinated. Data were collected from the four villages by interviewing the village animal health worker in each village using a standard questionnaire. Morbidity rates for the fully vaccinated village were 1% and 7.9% for the partially vaccinated village and were much lower compared with the two adjacent, unvaccinated villages where morbidity rates were 61% and 74.3% respectively. Estimates of the financial losses incurred were USD 1.7-1.9 per cow or buffalo for the fully vaccinated village, USD 6.9-8.1 for the partly vaccinated village and 52.4-70.8 USD in the unvaccinated villages, providing evidence that a large opportunity cost is incurred by failing to vaccinate in areas where the risk of FMD incursions is high.",[],"['L Rast', 'P A Windsor', 'S Khounsy']"
"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, Ichthyophonus hoferi, and other causes of morbidity in Pacific herring Clupea pallasi spawning in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA.","Pacific herring Clupea pallasi populations in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA, declined from an estimated 9.8 x 10(7) kg in 1992 to 1.5 x 10(7) kg in 1994. To determine the role of disease in population decline, 233 Pacific herring from Prince William Sound were subjected to complete necropsy during April 1994. The North American strain of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was isolated from 11 of 233 fish (4.7%). VHSV was significantly related to myocardial mineralization, hepatocellular necrosis, submucosal gastritis, and meningoencephalitis. Ichthyophonus hoferi infected 62 of 212 (29%) fish. I. hoferi infections were associated with severe, disseminated, granulomatous inflammation and with increased levels of plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). I. hoferi prevalence in 1994 was more than double that of most previous years (1989 to 1993). Plasma chemistry values significantly greater (p < 0.01) in males than females included albumin, total protein, cholesterol, chloride, glucose, and potassium; only alkaline phosphatase was significantly greater in females. Hypoalbuminemia was relatively common in postspawning females; other risk factors included VHSV and moderate or severe focal skin reddening. Pacific herring had more than 10 species of parasites, but they were not associated with significant lesions. Two of the parasites have not previously been described: a renal intraductal myxosporean (11% prevalence) and an intestinal coccidian (91% prevalence). Transmission electron microscopy of a solitary mesenteric lesion revealed viral particles consistent with lymphocystis virus. No fish had viral erythrocytic necrosis (VEN).

Fibrinogenolytic and procoagulant activities in the hemorrhagic syndrome caused by Lonomia obliqua caterpillars.,"The hemorrhagic syndrome caused by accidents with caterpillars of the genus Lonomia has been the focus of several clinical and biochemical studies, since its venom is composed of many active principles that interfere with the hemostatic system. Whereas a fibrinolytic agent has been characterized in the venom of Lonomia achelous, in Lonomia obliqua, only a prothrombin activator activity has been reported so far, even though both species cause similar bleeding disorders, characterized by hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and acute renal failure. Considering the possibility that the hemorrhagic syndrome resulting from envenoming by L. obliqua may be due to fibrinolytic and procoagulant activities acting together, we decided to investigate the effects of bristle extract (BE) of this species upon blood coagulation and fibrin(ogen)olysis. This study shows that besides a procoagulant activity related to the activation of prothrombin, the venom contains at least one fibrin(ogen)olytic activity, as shown by fibrinolysis in a fibrin (F) plate assay, by interference in thrombin-catalyzed fibrinocoagulation, and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile of fibrin and fibrinogen (Fg) degradation. Considering that a recombinant prothrombin activator from L. obliqua has been suggested in other studies to be used as an anti-thrombotic agent, it is important in the first place to better characterize the different active principles of this venom.",[],"['Ana Beatriz G Veiga', 'Antônio F M Pinto', 'Jorge A Guimarães']"

The sensitivity of the procedures was first tested against cell culture isolation, obtaining a limit of detection (LD) of 100 TCID50 ml-1 (100-fold below the LD using cell culture), at a threshold cycle value (Ct) of 36. Sensitivity was also evaluated using RNA from crude (LD = 1 fg; 160 genome copies) and purified virus (100 ag; 16 copies), plasmid DNA (2 copies) and RNA transcript (15 copies). No differences between both chemistries were observed in sensitivity and dynamic range. To evaluate repeatability and reproducibility, all experiments were performed in triplicate and on 3 different days, by workers with different levels of experience, obtaining Ct values with coefficients of variation always <5. This fact, together with the high efficiency and R2 values of the standard curves, encouraged us to analyse the reliability of the method for viral quantification. The results not only demonstrated that the procedure can be used for detection, identification and quantification of this virus, but also demonstrated a clear correlation between the regression lines obtained with different standards, which will help scientists to compare sensitivity results between different studies.

Development and validation of a novel Taqman-based real-time RT-PCR assay suitable for demonstrating freedom from viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) is a serious disease in several fish species. VHS is caused by the rhabdovirus viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV). To prevent spreading of the pathogen, it is important to use a fast, robust, sensitive and specific diagnostic tool to identify the infected fish. Traditional diagnosis based on isolation in cell culture followed by identification using, for example, ELISA is sensitive and specific but slow. By switching to RT-PCR for surveillance and diagnosis of VHS the time needed before a correct diagnosis can be given will be considerably shortened and the need for maintaining expensive cell culture facilities reduced. Here we present the validation, according to OIE guidelines, of a sensitive and specific Taqman-based real-time RT-PCR. The assay detects all isolates in a panel of 79 VHSV isolates covering all known genotypes and subtypes, with amplification efficiencies of approximately 100%. The analytical and diagnostic specificity of the real-time RT-PCR is close to 1, and the analytical and diagnostic sensitivity is comparable with traditional cell-based methods. In conclusion, the presented real-time RT-PCR assay has the necessary qualities to be used as a VHSV surveillance tool on par with cell culture assays.",[],"['S P Jonstrup', 'S Kahns', 'H F Skall', 'T S Boutrup', 'N J Olesen']"
Co-injection of interleukin 8 with the glycoprotein gene from viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) modulates the cytokine response in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"Since previous results showed that interleukin 8 (IL-8) was induced in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in response to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection, we have cloned IL-8 in an expression vector (pIL8+) and studied its possible adjuvant effect on the early response to a VHSV immunization model, focusing on the early response of several cytokines induced by a vector coding for the glycoprotein of VHSV (pMCV1.4-G) in the spleen and head kidney. First, we demonstrated that the pIL8+ successfully transcribed IL-8, by induction of IL-8 transcription in the muscle and blood, and by a massive infiltration of neutrophils at the muscle inoculation site. We have studied the effect of pIL8+ co-administration on the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha); cytokines that have mainly an inhibitory role, IL-11 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta); and a Th1 type cytokine, IL-18. We demonstrated that the co-administration of pIL8+ with pMCV1.4-G modulates the cytokine response that is induced, mainly by having its effect increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha1), with a greater impact on the spleen, and to a lesser extent in the head kidney. All these data suggest that IL-8 is able to modulate the early cytokine immune response that is produced in response to a DNA vaccine, and therefore, might be a potential immune adjuvant in fish viral vaccination. More work should be done to determine if this modulation has a beneficial effect on protection as seen in other mammal viral models.",[],"['N Jimenez', 'J Coll', 'F J Salguero', 'C Tafalla']"

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model for the study of vaccination against viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"The rhabdovirus viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is the etiological agent of one of the most important salmonid viral diseases. In the present work, the ability of VHSV to infect and replicate in zebrafish at low temperature (15 degrees C) was demonstrated. Zebrafish was also used to determine the effectiveness of the recombinant virus rIHNV-Gvhsv GFP as a live attenuated vaccine against the virulent VHSV strain. Fish intraperitoneally injected with 3 x 10(6) to 3 x 10(5)TCID50/ml of the wild type VHSV showed a 100% of cumulative mortality, meanwhile only 57% of mortality was obtained in bath infections. Infected fish showed external clinical signs and histological observations revealed the appearance of small haemorrhages in the muscle, kidney, liver and dermis. Neither mortalities nor clinical signs were recorded in fish infected with a live attenuated recombinant virus. By RT-PCR technique, VHSV was detected in all the organs as early as 24h, but the recombinant virus was not detected in all the sampled days. VHSV was able to replicate ""in vitro"" in head kidney cells but the replication capacity of the attenuated viral strain was limited. The recombinant virus rIHNV-Gvhsv GFP was able to protect against VHSV with a survival rate ranging from 20% to 60% depending of the vaccine dose. The increase of TLR3, IFNalphabeta, Mx, IFNgamma and TNFalpha expression at 72h post-infection in the kidney of VHSV-infected fish contrasted with the results obtained with the avirulent virus, which did not induce an increment of this expression in infected fish. Zebrafish is a suitable animal model to study VHSV infection and immune (innate and adaptive) responses and, more importantly, we demonstrate for the first time the usefulness of the zebrafish as a vaccination model to viral diseases. In addition, the high protection obtained with the live attenuated virus demonstrates that the zebrafish is able to mount an efficient antiviral immune response at 15 degrees C.",[],"['Beatriz Novoa', 'Alejandro Romero', 'Victoriano Mulero', 'Iván Rodríguez', 'Ignacio Fernández', 'Antonio Figueras']"
"Community perceptions of important camel diseases in Lapur Division of Turkana District, Kenya.","This paper presents the results of a study conducted in Lapur Division of Turkana District, Kenya, to estimate the incidence and mortality of camel trypanosomosis using participatory methods. Four livestock camps ('adakars') were conveniently selected for the study. Four informant groups comprising 6 8 key persons were used for the participatory exercises. The camel diseases identified by the pastoralists in their order of importance according to annual incidence were: trypanosomosis (11.4%); mange (10.8%); tick infestation (7.9%); haemorrhagic septicaemia (7.7%); and non-specific diarrhoea (7.6%). Almost half (49.3%) of the camel population suffered from at least one disease over the previous year. The annual incidence and mortality rates of trypanosomosis were estimated at 15%, and 9.9%, in adult camels and 6.9% and 5.2%, in young camels, respectively. There was a seasonal occurrence of trypanosomosis, with most cases reported in the dry season. The prevalence levels of the disease reportedly declined from about 100%, in 1978 to an almost stable state of about 15% in 2002. This study revealed that camel trypanosomosis is still an important disease in Turkana District, exacting a heavy toll in terms of morbidity and mortality. The economic losses due to the disease were likely to have been great owing to the central role the camel plays in this arid district of Kenya.",[],"['K O M Mochabo', 'P M Kitala', 'P B Gathura', 'W O Ogara', 'A Catley', 'E M Eregae', 'T D Kaitho']"
Replacement of the human cytomegalovirus promoter with fish enhancer and core elements to control the expression of the G gene of viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV).,"This work explores some of the possibilities to replace human cytomegalovirus (CMV) core and/or enhancer promoter control elements to create new expression vectors for use with fish. The work is relevant to fish vaccination, since DNA vaccines use eukaryotic expression plasmids controlled by the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter to be effective against novirhabdoviruses, such as viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), one of the most devastating fish viral European diseases. To reduce possible homologous recombination with fish genome, core and enhancer sequences from fish origin, such as trout interferon-inducible myxovirus protein (Mx), zebrafish retrovirus long terminal repeat (LTR) and carp β-actin (AE6), were combined with those of CMV to design alternative hybrid promoters. The substitution of CMV core and/or enhancer with the corresponding elements of Mx or the LTR core maintained a similar in vitro protein G expression level than that obtained by using the CMV promoter. Vectors using the dsRNA-inducible Mx enhancer followed either by the LTR or the AE6 cores showed the highest in vitro protein G expression levels. Furthermore, synthetic constructs using the Mx enhancer maintained their polyI:C induction capabilities despite the core used. Some of these hybrid promoters might contribute to the development of all-fish-vectors for DNA vaccines while others might be useful for more basic studies.",[],"['A Martinez-Lopez', 'B Chinchilla', 'P Encinas', 'E Gomez-Casado', 'A Estepa', 'J M Coll']"
Risk assessment for the design of a risk-based surveillance programme for fish farms in Switzerland (in accordance with Council Directive 2006/88/EC of the European Union).,"Swiss aquaculture farms were assessed according to their risk of acquiring or spreading viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN). Risk factors for the introduction and spread of VHS and IHN were defined and assessed using published data and expert opinions. Among the 357 aquaculture farms identified in Switzerland, 49.3% were categorised as high risk, 49.0% as medium risk and 1.7% as low risk. According to the new Directive 2006/88/EC for aquaculture of the European Union, the frequency of farm inspections must be derived from their risk levels. A sensitivity analysis showed that water supply and fish movements were highly influential on the output of the risk assessment regarding the introduction of VHS and IHN. Fish movements were also highly influential on the risk assessment output regarding the spread of these diseases.",[],"['N Diserens', 'P Presi', 'D Bernet', 'G Schüpbach-Regula']"
In vivo and in vitro analysis of the resistance against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) precedingly infected with aquabirnavirus.,"The resistance of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus Temminck et Schlegel) against a viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) challenge induced by a preceding non-lethal aquabirnavirus (ABV) challenge was investigated through experimental dual-infections with different intervals between the two challenges. The non-specific protection conferred by the primary ABV infection against the secondary VHSV infection commenced at Day 3 and persisted up to Day 14 but vanished at Day 21 post-ABV challenge. The in vitro assay using HINAE (hirame natural embryo) cells demonstrated anti-VHSV activity in the serum of ABV-challenged flounder from Day 1 to Day 14 but not at Day 21 post-ABV challenge. A high expression of a Mx gene, a molecular marker of type I interferon(s) (IFN) occurred in the head kidneys of ABV-challenged flounder from Day 1 to Day 7. These results suggest that the non-specific protection against the secondary VHSV infection in flounder was due to IFN(s) induced by the primary ABV infection.",[],"['Rolando Pakingking', 'Yasushi Okinaka', 'Koh-Ichiro Mori', 'Misao Arimoto', 'Kiyokuni Muroga', 'Toshihiro Nakai']"

Molecular heterogeneity of plpE gene in Indian isolates of Pasteurella multocida and expression of recombinant PlpE in vaccine strain of P. multocida serotype B: 2.,"Outer membrane proteins of Pasteurella (P.) multocida have been known to be protective immunogens. Pasteurella lipoprotein E (PlpE) has been reported to be an important cross reactive outer membrane protein in P. multocida. The gene encoding the PlpE of P. multocida serotypes A: 3, B: 2 and D: 1 was amplified from the genomic DNA. The amplified products were cloned and the nucleotide sequence was determined. Sequence analysis of the recombinant clones revealed a single open reading frame of 1,011 bp, 1,008 bp and 1,017 bp encoding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 37.829 kDa, 37.389 kDa and 37.965 kDa for serotypes A: 3, B: 2 and D: 1 respectively. The comparison of the plpE sequence in different capsular types revealed a high degree (> 90%) of homology.

Improving the safety of viral DNA vaccines: development of vectors containing both 5' and 3' homologous regulatory sequences from non-viral origin.,"Although some DNA vaccines have proved to be very efficient in field trials, their authorisation still remains limited to a few countries. This is in part due to safety issues because most of them contain viral regulatory sequences to driving the expression of the encoded antigen. This is the case of the only DNA vaccine against a fish rhabdovirus (a negative ssRNA virus), authorised in Canada, despite the important economic losses that these viruses cause to aquaculture all over the world. In an attempt to solve this problem and using as a model a non-authorised, but efficient DNA vaccine against the fish rhabdovirus, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), we developed a plasmid construction containing regulatory sequences exclusively from fish origin. The result was an ""all-fish vector"", named pJAC-G, containing 5' and 3' regulatory sequences of β-acting genes from carp and zebrafish, respectively. In vitro and in vivo, pJAC-G drove a successful expression of the VHSV glycoprotein G (G), the only antigen of the virus conferring in vivo protection. Furthermore, and by means of in vitro fusion assays, it was confirmed that G protein expressed from pJAC-G was fully functional. Altogether, these results suggest that DNA vaccines containing host-homologous gene regulatory sequences might be useful for developing safer DNA vaccines, while they also might be useful for basic studies.",[],"['A Martinez-Lopez', 'P Encinas', 'P García-Valtanen', 'E Gomez-Casado', 'J M Coll', 'A Estepa']"
Viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) up-regulates the cytotoxic activity and the perforin/granzyme pathway in the rainbow trout RTS11 cell line.,"A survey of immune-relevant genes that might be up-regulated in response to viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in the rainbow trout monocyte-macrophage cell line, RTS11, unexpectedly revealed an increased expression of perforin (PRF) and granzyme (GRZ) genes, which represent components of the major cytotoxic pathway. The natural killer-enhancing factor (NKEF), also known to modulate cytotoxic activity, was up-regulated at the gene but strikingly down-regulated at protein level. The expression of these genes was not affected in head kidney leukocytes (HKLs) infected with VHSV, leading us to evaluate the potential cytotoxic activity of RTS11 and HKLs. For the first time, the cytotoxic activity of RTS11 against xenogeneic targets has been demonstrated, although this was modest relative to HKLs. Yet the activity in RTS11 was significantly increased by VHSV, as in HKLs. This cytotoxic activity elicited by viral infection appeared to require viral gene expression because inactivated VHSV failed to increase RTS11 cytotoxic activity. As for other immune functions, RTS11 cells provide a model for further studying cytotoxic activities of fish monocyte-macrophages.",[],"['M C Ordás', 'A Cuesta', 'L Mercado', 'N C Bols', 'C Tafalla']"

REP-PCR analysis of Pasteurella multocida isolates that cause haemorrhagic septicaemia.,"Amplification of multiple P multocida genomic DNA fragments by outwardly-directed primers based on the repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) consensus sequence, generated complex profiles in a PCR-based fingerprinting method known as REP-PCR. Polymorphisms within REP-PCR profiles were used to characterise 38 isolates of P multocida. The high degree of homogeneity observed among haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) strains of serotype B and E provided evidence of a disease-associated REP profile that may serve as a novel method for the identification of HS strains regardless of serotype. REP-PCR profiles of other P multocida serotypes were highly variable, illustrating the potential of this technique for the molecular fingerprinting of fowl cholera or atrophic rhinitis isolates.

An ELISA for detection of trout antibodies to viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus using recombinant fragments of their viral G protein.,"An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to study serum antibodies to viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was designed by using recombinant fragments of their G protein. By using this fragment-ELISA, we describe the binding of antibodies against recombinant G fragments of 45-445 amino acids present in VHSV-hyperimmunized trout sera. Fragments were designed by taking into account their tridimensional pH-dependent structure and functional domains. Sera were obtained from hyperimmunized trout following 4-5 intraperitoneal injections of VHSV antigens by using Freund's or saponin adjuvants. Sera from different hyperimmunized trout differed quantitatively rather than qualitatively in their recognition of solid-phase frg11 (56-110), frg12 (65-109), frg13 (97-167), frg14 (141-214), frg15 (65-250), frg16 (252-450) and G (G21-465) by Western blot and ELISA. However, titres were higher when using frg11, frg15 or frg16, rather than G21-465, suggesting higher accessibility to G epitopes. Further knowledge of the antigenicity of the G protein of rhabdoviruses by using fragments might be used to improve current vaccines. On the other hand, they might be used to dissect the trout antibody response to VHSV infections, to complement in vitro neutralizing assays, and/or to quantitate anti-VHSV antibodies in VHSV-infected/vaccinated trout, other fish and/or other body fluids such as mucus.",[],"['P Encinas', 'E Gomez-Casado', 'A Estepa', 'J M Coll']"
Optimal place of a foreign gene in the genome of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) for development of VHSV-based viral-vectored vaccines.,"As the strength and duration of immune responses can be regulated by the antigen dose, higher expression of foreign antigens in the viral-vectored vaccines would be an important factor for inducing effective immune responses. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal insertion place of a foreign antigen gene in the genome of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) for development of VHSV-based viral-vectored vaccines.Recombinant VHSVs (rVHSVs) harbouring the red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene between N and P (rVHSV-A-RFP), P and M (rVHSV-B-RFP), or M and G genes (rVHSV-C-RFP) in the genome were rescued by reverse genetics. Their replication ability and expression level of RFP were compared according to the inserted locations. The viral titres of each rVHSV were not significantly different. However, Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells infected with rVHSV-A-RFP or rVHSV-B-RFP showed clearly higher fluorescence than cells infected with rVHSV-C-RFP. There was no significant difference in RFP expression between cells infected with rVHSV-A-RFP and rVHSV-B-RFP.The present results indicate that insertion of a foreign gene between N and P, or P and M genes of VHSV genome would be advantageous for development of VHSV-based viral-vectored vaccines.The present work is the first report on the optimal location of a foreign gene in VHSV genome for high expression, and the locations identified in this study would be suitable for the development of VHSV-based viral-vectored vaccines.",[],"['M S Kim', 'J S Park', 'K H Kim']"
Pan-genomic approach shows insight of genetic divergence and pathogenic-adaptation of Pasteurella multocida.,"Pasteurella multocida is a gram-negative, non-motile bacterial pathogen, which is associated with chronic and acute infections as snuffles, pneumonia, atrophic rhinitis, fowl cholera and hemorrhagic septicemia. These diseases affect a wide range of domestic animals, leading to significant morbidity and mortality and causing significant economic losses worldwide. Due to the interest in deciphering the genetic diversity and process adaptive between P. multocida strains, this work aimed was to perform a pan-genome analysis to evidence horizontal gene transfer and positive selection among 23 P. multocida strains isolated from distinct diseases and hosts. The results revealed an open pan-genome containing 3585 genes and an accessory genome presenting 1200 genes. The phylogenomic analysis based on the presence/absence of genes and islands exhibit high levels of plasticity, which reflects a high intraspecific diversity and a possible adaptive mechanism responsible for the specific disease manifestation between the established groups (pneumonia, fowl cholera, hemorrhagic septicemia and snuffles). Additionally, we identified differences in accessory genes among groups, which are involved in sugar metabolism and transport systems, virulence-related genes and a high concentration of hypothetical proteins. However, there was no specific indispensable functional mechanism to decisively correlate the presence of genes and their adaptation to a specific host/disease. Also, positive selection was found only for two genes from sub-group hemorrhagic septicemia, serotype B. This comprehensive comparative genome analysis will provide new insights of horizontal gene transfers that play an essential role in the diversification and adaptation mechanism into P. multocida species to a specific disease.","['Genes', 'Genomic islands', 'Pan-genome analysis', 'Virulence factors']","['Raquel Hurtado', 'Dennis Carhuaricra', 'Siomar Soares', 'Marcus Vinicius Canário Viana', 'Vasco Azevedo', 'Lenin Maturrano', 'Flávia Aburjaile']"
Effect of intraperitoneally administered IL-1beta-derived peptides on resistance to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss.,"The present work provides the first information concerning the immunostimulatory activity of trout interleukin (IL)-1beta-derived peptides in vivo.

Optimal migration of peritoneal leucocytes, peptide induced phagocytosis and intracellular respiratory burst activity occurred following intraperitoneal injection of 3.0 micromol of P3.

Genetically similar VHSV isolates are differentially virulent in olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus.,"Two viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) isolates, VHSV-KR-CJA and VHSV-KR-YGH, were isolated from viral hemorrhagic septicemia disease outbreaks in flounder farms in South Korea. The VHSV-KR-CJA isolate was isolated from a flounder farm with high mortality (80%), while the VHSV-KR-YGH isolate was isolated from a flounder farm with low mortality (15%), suggesting that these isolates differ in virulence. The virulence of these isolates was evaluated in juvenile flounder via intraperitoneal injection. Consistent with their virulence in the field, mortality data revealed that the VHSV-KR-CJA isolate was highly pathogenic (cumulative mortality of 80%), while the VHSV-KR-YGH isolate was less pathogenic in flounder (cumulative mortality of 20%). To characterize the genotypes of these viruses, the full open reading frames (ORFs) encoding nucleoprotein N, phosphoprotein P, matrix protein M, glycoprotein G, nonstructural viral protein NV, and polymerase L of these viruses were sequenced and analyzed. Sequence analysis revealed that both isolates are genetically very similar (identical amino acid sequences for P, M, NV, and L and >99.7 and 99.8% amino acid sequence identity for N and G, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both of these viruses belong to the Genotype IVa group, suggesting that they originated from a common ancestral virus. The low pathogenicity VHSV strain may potentially evolve to become a more pathogenic strain through only a few nucleotide substitutions.

Indirect hemagglutination and agglutination tests demonstrated antibody in nearly all sera.

The marine medaka (Oryzias dancena) β-actin promoter was clearly stronger than cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter when the vectors were transfected to Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells or injected into the muscle of olive flounder, suggesting that marine medaka β-actin promoter would be more appropriate promoter for DNA vaccines in olive flounder than CMV promoter. Olive flounder immunized with the Δalr Δasd E. tarda harboring viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) DNA vaccine vector driven by the marine medaka β-actin promoter showed significantly higher serum neutralization titer and higher survival rates against challenge with VHSV than fish immunized with the bacteria carrying VHSV DNA vaccine vector driven by CMV promoter. These results indicate that auxotrophic E. tarda mutant harboring marine medaka β-actin promoter-driven DNA vaccine vectors would be a potential system for prophylactics of infectious diseases in olive flounder.",[],"['Seung Hyuk Choi', 'Min Sun Kim', 'Ki Hong Kim']"
"Ex vivo transfection of trout pronephros leukocytes, a model for cell culture screening of fish DNA vaccine candidates.","DNA vaccination opened a new era in controlling and preventing viral diseases since DNA vaccines have shown to be very efficacious where some conventional vaccines have failed, as it occurs in the case of the vaccines against fish novirhabdoviruses. However, there is a big lack of in vitro model assays with immune-related cells for preliminary screening of in vivo DNA vaccine candidates. In an attempt to solve this problem, rainbow trout pronephros cells in early primary culture were transfected with two plasmid DNA constructions, one encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and another encoding the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) glycoprotein G (G(VHSV)) - the only viral antigen which has conferred in vivo protection. After assessing the presence of GFP- and G(VHSV)-expressing cells, at transcription and protein levels, the immune response in transfected pronephros cells was evaluated. At 24h post-transfection, G(VHSV) up-regulated migm and tcr transcripts expression, suggesting activation of B and T cells, as well, a high up-regulation of tnfα gene was observed. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, we detected the up-regulation of mx and tnfα genes transcripts and Mx protein which correlated with the induction of an anti-VHSV state. All together we have gathered evidence for successful transfection of pronephros cells with pAE6G, which correlates with in vivo protection results, and is less time-consuming and more rapid than in vivo assays. Therefore, this outcome opens the possibility to use pronephros cells in early primary culture for preliminary screening fish DNA vaccines as well as to further investigate the function that these cells perform in fish immune response orchestration after DNA immunisation.",[],"['M Ortega-Villaizan', 'A Martinez-Lopez', 'P Garcia-Valtanen', 'V Chico', 'L Perez', 'J M Coll', 'A Estepa']"

"Pepscan mapping and fusion-related properties of the major phosphatidylserine-binding domain of the glycoprotein of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, a salmonid rhabdovirus.","The binding of labeled phosphatidylserine (PS) to a collection of synthetic 15-mer peptides covering full-length glycoprotein G (G) of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), a salmonid rhabdovirus, showed three dominant overlapping reactive peptides. This major PS-binding region was contained in a 28-mer peptide (p2; aa 82-109) with consecutive hydrophobic amino acid a-d heptad repeats (putative amphipathic alpha-helix) and 2 carboxy-terminal arginines. This 28-mer peptide showed a 10-fold higher apparent specific activity for PS binding than the 15-mer peptides. Binding to PS was also detected with virion-purified protein G but was not detected with other viral proteins. The highest apparent specific activity for PS binding was found with purified VHSV particles by both solid-phase and liquid assays. In contrast to the pH-independent PS binding to peptide p2, binding to virions was optimal at pH 5.6. PS binding to purified VHSV was greatly reduced by protease or detergent treatments that removed protein G, by treatment at pH 7.6, or by anti-p2 mouse antibodies at pH 5.6. The PS-binding region seems to be related to viral-host cell fusion since anti-p2 mouse antibodies inhibited VHSV-infected cell to cell fusion (fusion from within) and the pH profile of the VHSV-infected cell to cell fusion was similar to the pH profile of PS binding to VHSV. Comparative analysis showed that sequences similar to the major PS-binding domain of VHSV were also present in other fish rhabdoviruses and in rabies and vesicular stomatitis viruses.",[],"['A Estepa', 'J M Coll']"
"DNA vaccination against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) in rainbow trout: size, dose, route of injection and duration of protection-early protection correlates with Mx expression.","Rainbow trout of different sizes (10 and 100g) were injected intramuscularly (i.m.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) with different doses (range 10 ng-10 microg) of a viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS)-DNA vaccine (pcDNA3vhsG). As controls, fish were injected with the pcDNA3 plasmid alone, or with inactivated VHS virus. Fish were challenged at different times post-vaccination (p.v.) to assess protection. At certain times p.v., serum samples were analysed for neutralising antibody and liver tissue was analysed for Mx mRNA expression. A DNA dose of 0.5 microg injected by the i.m. route induced protection in fish of all sizes in challenges performed either 1 or 4 weeks p.v. This dose also conferred effective protection up to 9 months p.v. in fish >100 g. With lower doses of DNA (0.1 and 0.01 microg) and challenge at 4 weeks p.v., 10 g fish were partially protected but protection was not observed in 100 g fish. Vaccination by the i.p. route induced no or lower levels of protection compared with the i.m. route. Fish vaccinated with 0.5 microg DNA i.m. had no detectable serum neutralising antibody (NAb) at 4 weeks p.v.

Observations on haemorrhagic septicaemia in Pakistan livestock.,"Information based on field observations of Veterinary Officers in nine districts of Punjab, Pakistan showed 11% incidence, 9% mortality and 78% case fatality rates of haemorrhagic septicaemia in buffalo, whereas these values were 4%, 2.5% and 62% in cattle. Disease incidence was higher in 0-24-month-old animals and groups of less than 10 animals. The disease was seasonal, occurring only in rainy seasons of the year, and victims were only cattle and buffalo. The clinical course of the disease was generally 1-2 days. symptoms included high temperature, salivation, swelling of the throat and difficulty in breathing and could result in death. Successful treatment was reported if antibiotics were given at the initial stages of the disease. Various combinations of sulphur drugs and antibiotics were considered more effective. The results of the questionnaire survey suggest that a favourable response was obtained using clamoxyl LA, farmox 15%, vesulong, gentakel and chloramphenicol. Previous vaccination of livestock with the alum-precipitated formalinized broth culture of Pasteurella multocida vaccine (bacterin) was not considered to protect against field outbreaks.",[],"['M A Sheikh', 'M Anzam', 'A R Shakoori']"
DNA vaccination against a fish rhabdovirus promotes an early chemokine-related recruitment of B cells to the muscle.,"In fish, intramuscular (i.m) injection of plasmid DNA encoding viral proteins has proved a highly effective vaccination strategy against some viral pathogens. The efficacy of DNA vaccination in teleost fish is based on the high level of viral antigen expression in muscle cells inducing a strong and long-lasting protection. However, the mechanisms through which this protection is established and effectuated in fish are still not fully understood. Moreover, similarities to mammalian models cannot be established since DNA vaccination in mammals usually induces much weaker responses. In this work, we have focused on the characterization of the immune cells that infiltrate the muscle at the site of DNA injection in vaccinated fish and the chemokines and chemokine receptors that may be involved in their infiltration. We have demonstrated through diverse techniques that B lymphocytes, both IgM⁺ and IgT⁺ cells, represented a major infiltrating cell type in fish vaccinated with a viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) glycoprotein-encoding DNA vaccine, whereas in control fish injected with an oil adjuvant mainly granulocyte/monocyte-type cells were attracted. Among twelve chemokine genes studied, only CXCL11_L1, CK5B and CK6 mRNA levels were up-regulated in DNA vaccinated fish compared to fish injected with the corresponding vector backbone. Furthermore, the transcription of CXCR3B, a possible receptor for CXCL11_L1 was also significantly up-regulated in vaccinated fish. Finally, experiments performed with recombinant trout CK5B and CK6 and chemokine expression plasmids revealed that these chemokines have chemotactic capacities which might explain the recruitment of B cells to the site of DNA injection. Altogether, our results reveal that there is an early chemokine-related B cell recruitment triggered by i.m. DNA vaccination against VHSV which might play an important role in the initial phase of the immune response.","['B cells', 'Chemokine receptors', 'Chemokines', 'DNA vaccine', 'Teleost fish', 'Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV)']","['Rosario Castro', 'Susana Martínez-Alonso', 'Uwe Fischer', 'Neila Álvarez de Haro', 'Verónica Soto-Lampe', 'Tiehui Wang', 'Christopher J Secombes', 'Niels Lorenzen', 'Ellen Lorenzen', 'Carolina Tafalla']"
Biological characterization of Pasteurella multocida present in the Saiga population.,"This study provides biochemical and molecular genetic characteristics of P. multocida isolated from dead saigas in 1988, 2010-2015 on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.Bacteriological samples taken from carcasses of saiga antelope during mortality events recorded in West Kazakhstan in both 2010 and 2011 and in Kostanay in 2012 and 2015 confirmed the presence of P. multocida, according to morphological and biochemical characterisation. Only in the event of 2015 was the agent proven to be the causative agent of the disease observed, haemorrhagic septicaemia. In the other mortality events it is not certain if the organism was a primary aetiology or an incidental finding as confirmatory pathological investigation was not undertaken. The implemented phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal RNA 16S gene allowed us to identify Pasteurella strains isolated in 2010-2015 as P. multocida subspecies multocida. Capsular typing by PCR showed that the studied strains isolated from dead saiga in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015 belonged to serotype B. MLST analysis showed that these strains of P. multocida are of the capsule type B and form one clonal grouping with isolates ST64, ST44, ST45, ST46, ST44, ST47 which isolated from cases of hemorrhagic septicemia of animals in Hungary, Burma, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Spain. Sixteen virulence genes of the five strains of P. multocida, isolated from saigas were studied using multiplex PCR. ptfA, ompA, ompH, oma87, plpB, fimA, hsf-2, pfhA, exbB, tonB, hgbA, fur, nanB, nanH and pmHAS genes were detected in all strains. The toxA gene was not identified in the studied strains. The phylogenies of these isolates is compared across saiga populations and years and the 2015 isolate was compared to that of an isolate from a disease outbreak in 1988 and the findings suggest that these isolated bacteria are stable commensals, opportunistically pathogenic, being phylogenetically uniform with very little genetic variation notable over the last 4 decades.Isolation, phenotypic and genetic characterization of the P. multocida isolates inform understanding of the epidemiology of infection in saigas and predict virulent potential of these opportunistic bacteria.","['16S rRNA gene', 'MLST', 'Mass mortality events', 'Pasteurella multocida', 'Saiga antelope', 'Virulence gene']","['Mukhit Orynbayev', 'Kulyaisan Sultankulova', 'Abylay Sansyzbay', 'Rashida Rystayeva', 'Kamshat Shorayeva', 'Aidar Namet', 'Sasan Fereidouni', 'Gulnaz Ilgekbayeva', 'Kainar Barakbayev', 'Syrym Kopeyev', 'Richard Kock']"

Four years of monitoring for viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus in marine waters around the United Kingdom.,"Between 1995 and 1998, marine fish from around the coast of the UK were collected and samples analysed for viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) using cell culture isolation methods. In 1997 and 1998 the samples were also analysed for VHSV by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). A total of 1867 fish of 11 species were tested, but VHSV was isolated on only 1 occasion, from herring Clupea harengus, in 1996. However, despite VHSV not being isolated in 1997 and 1998, in both years samples of herring from the west and south coasts of England produced positive signals in the RT-PCR, and in 1997 cod from the east coast of England also produced positive signals in the RT-PCR. These results are believed to be true indications of the presence of VHSV nucleic acid in the fish. In 1997, birnaviruses from Serogroup B1 were isolated from herring (a previously unrecorded host for the virus) and cod Gadus morhua, and a birnavirus from Serogroup A2 was also isolated from cod. In 1998, an aquareovirus was isolated from haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, a previously unrecorded host for the virus.",[],"['P F Dixon', 'S Avery', 'E Chambers', 'S Feist', 'H Mandhar', 'L Parry', 'D M Stone', 'H K Strømmen', 'J K Thurlow', 'C Tsin-yee Lui', 'K Way']"
Ranking freshwater fish farms for the risk of pathogen introduction and spread.,"A semi-quantitative model is presented to rank freshwater rainbow trout farms within a country or region with regards to the risk of becoming infected and spreading a specified pathogen. The model was developed to support a risk-based surveillance scheme for notifiable salmonid pathogens. Routes of pathogen introduction and spread were identified through a process of expert consultation in a series of workshops. The routes were combined into themes (e.g. exposure via water, mechanical transmission). Themes were weighted based on expert opinion. Risk factors for each route were scored and combined into a theme score which was adjusted by the weight. The number of sources and consignments were used to assess introduction via live fish movements onto the farm. Biosecurity measures were scored to assess introduction on fomites. Upstream farms, wild fish and processing plants were included in assessing the likelihood of introduction by water. The scores for each theme were combined to give separate risk scores for introduction and spread. A matrix was used to combine these to give an overall risk score. A case study for viral haemorrhagic septicaemia is presented. Nine farms that represent a range of farming practices of rainbow trout farms in England and Wales are used as worked examples of the model. The model is suited to risk rank freshwater salmonid farms which are declared free of the pathogen(s) under consideration. The score allocated to a farm does not equate to a quantitative probability estimate of the farm to become infected or spread infection. Nevertheless, the method provides a transparent approach to ranking farms with regards to pathogen transmission risks. The output of the model at a regional or national level allows the allocation of surveillance effort to be risk based. It also provides fish farms with information on how they can reduce their risk score by improving biosecurity. The framework of the model can be applied to different production systems which may have other routes of disease spread. Further work is recommended to validate the allocated scores. Expert opinion was obtained through workshops, where the outputs from groups were single point estimates for relative weights of risks. More formal expert opinion elicitation methods could be used to capture variation in the experts' estimates and uncertainty and would provide data on which to simulate the model stochastically. The model can be downloaded (in Microsoft(®)-Excel format) from the Internet at: http://www.cefas.defra.gov.uk/6701.aspx.",[],"['B C Oidtmann', 'C N Crane', 'M A Thrush', 'B J Hill', 'E J Peeler']"
Different peptides from hemorrhagic septicemia rhabdoviral proteins stimulate leucocyte proliferation with individual fish variation.,"Trout leucocytes from most of the survivors of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infections were capable of in vitro proliferation (T-like response) when cultured in the presence of short synthetic peptides designed from the G and the N cDNA-derived protein sequences of VHSV, a virus with substantial economic impact in trout farms. In contrast, no significant proliferative responses were obtained for the above-mentioned peptides from leucocytes obtained from either noninfected or genetically VHSV-resistant trout. However, since the anamnestic recognition of particular peptides (epitopes) of the G and the N protein by trout leucocytes varies largely within the outbred trout population, larger VHSV protein fragments were also tested. The finding that recombinant G and N fragments carrying multiple epitopes are recognized by the majority of the individual trout surviving VHSV infections and with higher stimulation indexes suggests that the recombinant viral proteins could be used as vaccines given the outbred nature of the fish.",[],"['G A Lorenzo', 'A Estepa', 'S Chilmonczyk', 'J M Coll']"

Validation of a model for ranking aquaculture facilities for risk-based disease surveillance.,"A semi-quantitative model for risk ranking of aquaculture facilities in Switzerland with regard to the introduction and spread of Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (VHS) and Infectious Haematopoietic Necrosis (IHN) was developed in a previous study (Diserens et al., 2013). The objective of the present study was to validate this model using data collected during field visits on aquaculture sites in four Swiss cantons compared to data collected through a questionnaire in the previous study. A discrepancy between the values obtained with the two different methods was found in 32.8% of the parameters, resulting in a significant difference (p<0.001) in the risk classification of the facilities. As data gathered exclusively by means of a questionnaire are not of sufficient quality to perform a risk-based surveillance of aquaculture facilities a combination of questionnaires and farm inspections is proposed. A web-based reporting system could be advantageous for the factors which were identified as being more likely to vary over time, in particular for factors considering fish movements, which showed a marginally significant difference in their risk scores (p≥0.1) within a six- month period. Nevertheless, the model proved to be stable over the considered period of time as no substantial fluctuations in the risk categorisation were observed (Kappa agreement of 0.77).Finally, the model proved to be suitable to deliver a reliable risk ranking of Swiss aquaculture facilities according to their risk of getting infected with or spreading of VHS and IHN, as the five facilities that tested positive for these diseases in the last ten years were ranked as medium or high risk. Moreover, because the seven fish farms that were infected with Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) during the same period also belonged to the risk categories medium and high, the classification appeared to correlate with the occurrence of this third viral fish disease.","['Disease', 'Fish', 'Infectious haematopoietic necrosis', 'Infectious pancreatic necrosis', 'Risk ranking', 'Risk-based surveillance', 'Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia']","['Nicolas Diserens', 'Laura Cristina Falzon', 'Beat von Siebenthal', 'Gertraud Schüpbach-Regula', 'Thomas Wahli']"
Expression of inducible CC chemokines in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in response to a viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) DNA vaccine and interleukin 8.,"In rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), at least three CXC chemokines and eighteen CC chemokine sequences have been discovered in the past years, although no studies concerning their bioactivity have been performed yet. We have studied the expression of five different CC chemokines that cluster into the group of inducible chemokines (CK5A, CK5B, CK6, CK7A and CK7B) in trout injected with a plasmid coding for the glycoprotein G gene (pMCV1.4-G) of viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). In a previous work, we had demonstrated that a plasmid coding for the CXC chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8, pIL8+) when co-administered with pMCV1.4-G was able to modulate the expression of induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, therefore, we have also studied the expression of these inducible CC chemokines in fish injected with pMCV1.4-G in the presence of pIL8+, study that will also help establish the relations among the different chemokine groups. All chemokines were induced in the head kidney of fish injected with the DNA vaccine, and the co-administration of pIL8+ together with the vaccine modulated the expression of all CC chemokines studied. In this sense, expression of the inducible CC chemokines was also studied in trout head kidney leucocytes treated with supernatants from EPC cells transfected with pIL8+.

Salmonid viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus: fusion-related enhancement of virus infectivity by peptides derived from viral glycoprotein G or a combinatorial library.,"To search for enhancers and/or inhibitors of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV, a salmonid rhabdovirus) infectivity, a total of 51 peptides from a pepscan of viral envelope protein G, a recombinant peptide from protein G (frg11) and 80 peptide mixtures from an alpha-helix-favoured combinatorial library were screened. However, contrary to what occurs in many other enveloped viruses, only peptides enhancing rather than inhibiting VHSV infectivity were found. Because some of the enhancer pepscan G peptides and frg11 were derived from phospholipid-binding or fusion-related regions identified previously, it was suggested that enhancement of virus infectivity might be related to virus-cell fusion. Furthermore, enhancement was significant only when the viral peptides were pre-incubated with VHSV at the optimal low pH of fusion, before being adjusted to physiological pH and assayed for infectivity. Enhancement of VHSV infectivity caused by the pre-incubation of VHSV with peptide p5 (SAAEASAKATAEATAKG), one of the individual enhancer peptides defined from the screening of the combinatorial library, was independent of the pre-incubation pH. However, it was also related to fusion because the binding of p5 to protein G induced VHSV to bypass the endosome pathway of infection and reduced the low-pH threshold of fusion, thus suggesting an alternative virus entry pathway for p5-VHSV complexes. Further investigations into VHSV enhancer peptides might shed some light on the mechanisms of VHSV fusion.",[],"['V Mas', 'L Pérez', 'J A Encinar', 'M T Pastor', 'A Rocha', 'E Perez-Paya', 'A Ferrer-Montiel', 'J M Gonzalez Ros', 'A Estepa', 'J M Coll']"
Elucidation of mechanism for host response to VHSV infection at varying temperatures in vitro and in vivo through proteomic analysis.,"Seasonal temperature has a major influence on the infectivity of pathogens and the host immune system. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is one such pathogen that only causes the mortality of fish at low temperatures. This study aims to discover the host defense mechanism and pathway for resistance to VHSV at higher temperatures. We first observed the VHSV infection patterns at low and higher temperatures in fathead minnow (FHM) cells (20 °C and 28 °C) and zebrafish (15 °C and 25 °C). In comparison to the 20 °C infection, FHM cells infected at 28 °C showed decreased apoptosis, increased cell viability, and reduced VHSV N gene expression. In zebrafish, infection at 25 °C caused no mortality and significantly reduced the N gene copy number in comparison to infection at 15 °C. To explore the antiviral infection mechanisms induced by high temperature in vitro and in vivo, the changes in the proteomic profile were measured through UPLC-MS<sup>E</sup> analysis. ACADL, PTPN6, TLR1, F7, A2M, and GLI2 were selected as high temperature-specific biomarkers in the FHM cell proteome; and MYH9, HPX, ANTXR1, APOA1, HBZ, and MYH7 were selected in zebrafish. Increased immune response, anticoagulation effects, and the formation of lymphocytes from hematopoietic stem cells were analyzed as functions that were commonly induced by high temperature in vitro and in vivo. Among these biomarkers, GLI2 was predicted as an upstream regulator. When treated with GANT58, a GLI-specific inhibitor, cell viability was further reduced due to GLI2 inhibition during VHSV infection at varying temperatures in FHM cells, and the mortality in zebrafish was induced earlier at the low temperature. Overall, this study discovered a new mechanism for VHSV infection in vitro and in vivo that is regulated by GLI2 protein.","['FHM cell', 'GLI2', 'Proteomic analysis', 'Rearing temperature', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)', 'Zebrafish (Danio rerio)']","['Se-Young Cho', 'Rachael A Protzman', 'Yeong O Kim', 'Bipin Vaidya', 'Myung-Joo Oh', 'Joseph Kwon', 'Duwoon Kim']"
The venom of the Lonomia caterpillar: an overview.,"Contact with the Lonomia caterpillar causes numerous accidents, especially in Venezuela and the southern region of Brazil, where it is considered a public health problem. The Lonomia obliqua venom causes disseminated intravascular coagulation and a consumptive coagulopathy, which can lead to a hemorrhagic syndrome.

In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the venom of the Lonomia caterpillar contains several toxins with procoagulant, anticoagulant and antithrombotic activities. These toxins also affect the endothelium. The recent construction of cDNA libraries of the transcripts from L. obliqua bristles enables the use of biotechnological approaches to study the venom.

Evaluation of DNA vaccination of spotted sand bass (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus) with two major outer-membrane protein-encoding genes from Aeromonas veronii.,"Genes encoding two major outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of the bacterial pathogen Aeromonas veronii, Omp38 and Omp48, were used to construct DNA vaccines. The protective effect of such vaccines against motile aeromonad septicaemia was evaluated in spotted sand bass (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus), an endemic species of the Mexican Northwest Pacific coast and a potential resource for the aquaculture industry. Weak protein expression, as determined by immunoblotting, was observed after transfection of eukaryotic cells with the DNA vaccines. Fish immunized with a single intramuscular injection of 20 microg of the omp38 and omp48 DNA vaccines showed slightly, but significantly elevated serum antibody levels 4 and 6 weeks after vaccination, compared to fish vaccinated with the control plasmid pcDNA3.1. Spotted sand bass vaccinated with the omp38 and omp48 DNA vaccines and challenged with A. veronii by intraperitoneal route recorded a relative percent survival (RPS) between 50 and 60%. Histopathological signs of motile aeromonad septicaemia were observed in around 40% of omp38 and omp48-vaccinated fish and 80% of pcDNA3.1-vaccinated control fish.

The assay was optimised to amplify VHS RNA by incubation at 63 degrees C for only 1h, and required only a simple water bath or heating block to provide a constant temperature of 63 degrees C. RT-LAMP amplification products were detected by visual inspection using SYBR Green I stain and had a ladder-like appearance when electrophoresed on an agarose gel. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was found to be similar to the commonly used RT-PCR method: both methods detected VHS RNA at a dilution of 10(6). The assay was evaluated using clinical samples and the results indicated the suitability and simplicity of the test as a rapid, field diagnostic tool for VHS virus.",[],"['H Soliman', 'M El-Matbouli']"
Analysis of Manifestation of CC and CXC Chemokine Genes in Olive Flounders (<i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>) Artificially Infected with VHSV during the Early Developmental Stage.,"Chemokines is a small protein that plays a major role in inflammatory reactions and viral infections as a chemotactic factor of cytokines involved in innate immunity. Most of the chemokines belong to the chemokine groups CC and CXC. To investigate the immune system of the olive flounder (<i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>), an expression pattern specifically induced in the early developmental stages of analysis is examined using qRT-PCR. We also examined tissue-specific expression of both CC and CXC chemokine in healthy olive flounder samples. CC and CXC chemokine shows increased expression after immune-related organs are formed compared to expression during early development. CC chemokine was more highly expressed in the fin, but CXC chemokine showed higher expression in the gills, spleen, intestines, and stomach. Spatial and temporal expression analysis of CC and CXC chemokine were performed following viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection. CC chemokine showed high expression in the gills, which are respiratory organs, whereas CXC chemokine was more highly expressed in the kidneys, an immune-related organ. These results suggest that CC and CXC chemokine play an important role in the immune response of the olive flounder, and may be used as basic data for the immunological activity and gene analysis of it as well as other fish.","['CC chemokine', 'CXC chemokine', 'Gene expression', 'Olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)']","['Kyung-Hee Kim', 'Woo-Jin Kim', 'Choul-Ji Park', 'Jong-Won Park', 'Gyeong Eon Noh', 'Seunghyung Lee', 'Young Mee Lee', 'Hyun Chul Kim']"
Risks associated with commodity trade: transmission of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) to rainbow trout fry from VHSV-carrying tissue-homogenates.,"Movements of commodity fish present a potential risk of transferring pathogens. Within a study to estimate the risk from imported rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss carcases, fry were exposed to tissue homogenates from market size rainbow trout infected experimentally with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) by waterborne exposure to VHS virus (VHSV, isolate of genotype Ia). Tissues were collected from fish that showed clinical signs and from recent mortalities. Homogenates of (i) internal organs, (ii) brain/gills and (iii) muscle tissue were prepared and added to tanks holding the fry. Virus transmission occurred from all tissues tested, causing high mortality of the fry. The results underline the potential risk of introduction of VHSV through the trade of fish products.",[],"['B Oidtmann', 'C Joiner', 'R A Reese', 'D Stone', 'M Dodge', 'P Dixon']"
Interferon response following infection with genetically similar isolates of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) exhibiting contrasting virulence in rainbow trout.,"Isolates of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) were identified which are genetically similar yet, based on their isolation history were considered likely to differ in virulence in juvenile rainbow trout. An experimental infection study was performed in order to verify this hypothesis and provide an experimental infectivity model with which to investigate the basis for susceptibility of rainbow trout to this commercially important virus. Significant differences in mortality were obtained following both intraperitoneal (IP) injection and immersion challenges with an early marine (DK-M.Rhabdo) and early rainbow trout VHSV isolate (DK-F1) respectively. Expression of Type I IFN, Mx1 (an IFN-inducible protein), and viral genes (encoding nucleo-, phospho-, matrix, glyco- and non-viron proteins) was studied in sequential tissue samples using real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR). Resulting data revealed a significant increase in IFN and Mx1 expression detected in fish challenged by IP injection with both isolates. Expression levels of these genes were directly related to the degree of viral replication as measured by the expression of VHSV RNAs. In immersion-challenged fish a significant increase in Mx1 was observed only when using the virulent isolate DK-F1; however no elevated host response was detectable in fish challenged with the marine isolate DK-M.Rhabdo. Quintessentially the inability to detect any virus in trout challenged with the marine isolate via immersion suggests the virus was incapable of establishing infection. The mechanisms for this appear to be more related to initial cellular entry and replication rather than due to the overcoming of initial infection via an elevated host innate immune response.",[],"['S Campbell', 'A McBeath', 'C Secombes', 'M Snow', 'B Collet']"
The rainbow trout TLR9 gene and its role in the immune responses elicited by a plasmid encoding the glycoprotein G of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (VHSV).,"The aim of this work was to improve the knowledge about the factors contributing to the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccines based on the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus glycoprotein G gene, through identifying the rainbow trout Toll-like receptor 9 (Omtlr9) gene that curiously contains an insertion of an incomplete transposon at the 5'-end of the third intron. Concerning the role played by this receptor in the fish innate defence, in response to the injection of a plasmid (pAE6) encoding or not the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (VHSV) glycoprotein G gene (pAE6-G), the presence of Omtlr9 transcripts remained unchanged in the fish secondary lymphoid organs while was highly increased at the injection site (muscle). The level of Omtlr9 transcripts correlated with those of cluster of differentiation 83 (cd83) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (cxcr4), suggesting the recruitment of dendritic-like cells into the muscle as the source of Omtlr9 expressing cells. Transcription of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) and interleukin-6 (il6) genes, two cytokines directly related to TLR9 induction with unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs), was solely observed in head kidney and spleen of the fish immunised with pAE6-G. Thus, the glycoprotein G of VHSV could be more implicated in triggering the pathways for TNF-alpha and IL6 production than the recognition of the unmethylated CpG motifs of the plasmid backbone by OmTLR9. Therefore, our results seem to indicate that OmTLR9-mediated recognition of plasmid DNA is not the key of the innate immune recognition of the adjuvant elements of fish DNA vaccines.",[],"['M Ortega-Villaizan', 'V Chico', 'A Falco', 'L Perez', 'J M Coll', 'A Estepa']"
Specific antibodies of Pasteurella multocida in newborn calves of vaccinated dams.,"Twenty-five newborn Holstein Friesian calves, from dams vaccinated against haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), were tested repeatedly over the first 6 months of life to monitor the transferred antibody levels against HS.

Susceptibility of juvenile sole Solea senegalensis to marine isolates of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus from wild and farmed fish.,"The susceptibility of sole Solea senegalensis to infection with 3 viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) strains obtained from wild Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides and farmed turbot Psetta maxima was demonstrated. Fish were infected by an intraperitoneal (i.p.), immersion or cohabitational route, and maintained at 16 degrees C. Infection trials showed that VHSV isolates were pathogenic for sole fingerlings by i.p. injection and waterborne exposure causing moderate levels of mortality (10 to 55%). In addition, the mortality observed in fish cohabitating with i.p.-infected sole confirms horizontal transmission of the virus. However, the low rates of mortality registered in this challenge suggest that there is a low dissemination of virus by the i.p.-infected sole, which results in lower secondary challenge of the cohabitating fish. External signs of disease included haemorrhaging of the ventral area and ascitic fluid in the body cavity. Dead fish were tested for VHSV by both cell culture and RT-PCR assay, using pools of kidney and spleen from 10 individuals. Virus was recovered from most of the pools composed of dead fish. The results obtained in this study not only demonstrate the susceptibility of sole to the VHSV strains employed but also indicate that wild VHSV marine isolates represent a potential risk for sole aquaculture.",[],"['C López-Vázquez', 'M Conde', 'C P Dopazo', 'J L Barja', 'I Bandín']"
Cloning of 87 kDa outer membrane protein gene of Pasteurella multocida P52.,"Pasteurella multocida serotype B:2 is the causative agent of haemorrhagic septicaemia, a fatal disease of cattle and buffaloes.

Comparison of two indirect ELISA coating antigens for the detection of dairy cow antibodies against Pasteurella multocida.,"The ELISA is recognized as an efficient diagnostic tool for antibody detection, but there is no standard ELISA assay for detection of antibodies against hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) in cattle. The present study reports on an indirect ELISA assay for antibody detection of HS in dairy cows, and evaluates the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the method using a Bayesian approach. An indirect ELISA was developed with two types of heat extract antigens, Pasteurella multocida strains P-1256 and M-1404, as coating antigens. A checkerboard titration was employed using dairy cow sera immunized with P. multocida bacterin and colostrum-deprived calf sera. The concentrations of heat extract antigen (160μg/mL), sample serum (1:100) and goat anti-bovine immunoglobulin G labeled with horseradish peroxidase (1:2000) were optimal for the assay. The cut-off values were 0.147 and 0.128 for P-1256 and M-1404 coating antigens, and there were no differences in the results of tests with positive and negative sera (p<0.05). The characteristics of three diagnostic tests were evaluated using a one-population Bayesian model, assuming conditional dependence between two types of coating antigen-based ELISAs and indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). A total of 415 sera samples from dairy cows without HS vaccination and no history of disease were tested. The Se and Sp of the P-1256 and M-1404 ELISAs were higher than those of the IHA. The Se and Sp of the P-1256 ELISA were 90.3% and 90.1%, while the Se and Sp of the M-1404 ELISA were 92.1% and 71.9%. The median values of Se and Sp from the IHA were 36.0% and 58.2%.","['Bayesian latent class analysis', 'Heat extract antigen', 'Hemorrhagic septicemia', 'Indirect ELISA', 'Pasteurella multocida']","['Pallop Tankaew', 'Wanwisa Srisawat', 'Tawatchai Singhla', 'Khajornsak Tragoolpua', 'Yasushi Kataoka', 'Takuo Sawada', 'Nattawooti Sthitmatee']"
A case of severe Ebola virus infection complicated by gram-negative septicemia.,"Ebola virus disease (EVD) developed in a patient who contracted the disease in Sierra Leone and was airlifted to an isolation facility in Hamburg, Germany, for treatment. During the course of the illness, he had numerous complications, including septicemia, respiratory failure, and encephalopathy. Intensive supportive treatment consisting of high-volume fluid resuscitation (approximately 10 liters per day in the first 72 hours), broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and ventilatory support resulted in full recovery without the use of experimental therapies. Discharge was delayed owing to the detection of viral RNA in urine (day 30) and sweat (at the last assessment on day 40) by means of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay, but the last positive culture was identified in plasma on day 14 and in urine on day 26. This case shows the challenges in the management of EVD and suggests that even severe EVD can be treated effectively with routine intensive care.

In vitro search for alternative promoters to the human immediate early cytomegalovirus (IE-cMV) to express the G gene of viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in fish epithelial cells.,"Present DNA vaccines against fish rhabdoviruses require intramuscular injection (fish-to-fish vaccination) of their G-protein gene under the control of the human immediate early cytomegalovirus (IE-CMV) promoter, while immersion delivery (mass DNA vaccination), for instance, by using fish epithelial-specific promoters, would be more practical for aquaculture. To find fish epithelial-specific promoters alternative to the IE-CMV, a comparative study of the effectiveness of different fish promoters constitutively expressing the G gene of the viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in the epithelial papulosum cyprini (EPC) cell line was performed. The study included MCV1.4 (an alternative IE-CMV promoter version), AE6 (a version of the carp beta-actin promoter), long terminal repeats (LTR) of zebrafish or walleye retroviruses, trout Mx1, carp myosin-heavy-chain and flatfish pleurocidin promoters and salmonid sleeping beauty (SB)/medaka Tol2 transposon repeats. The G-protein expression in transfected EPC cells was studied by estimating the number of cells expressing the G-protein in their membrane and the average expression level per cell. In addition, in an attempt to reduce their sizes, some regions of the MCV1.4 and AE6 promoters were deleted and expression levels compared to those observed for full-length promoters. Since both zebrafish LTR and carp AE6 promoters were the most effective regulatory sequences for expressing the VHSV G-protein in EPC cells, these sequences might be candidates for new DNA vaccine vectors for fish epithelial tissues avoiding the IE-CMV promoter. Furthermore, known transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) common to most of the fish G-expressing promoters, might enable the future design of fully synthetic or hybrid promoters with improved efficacy of VHSV G-protein expression in epithelial fish cells.",[],"['S Ruiz', 'C Tafalla', 'A Cuesta', 'A Estepa', 'J M Coll']"
"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus IVb experimental infection of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), and fathead minnow, Pimphales promelas (Rafinesque).","Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in the Great Lakes has had a dramatic impact on fish husbandry because of the implications of the presence of a reportable disease. Experimental infections with VHSV IVb were conducted in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), and fathead minnows, Pimphales promelas (Rafinesque), to examine their susceptibility and the clinical impact of infection. Triplicate groups of rainbow trout (n = 40) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 microL 10(6.5)50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID(50)) or waterborne exposed to graded doses (10(4.5), 10(6.5), and 10(8.5) TCID(50) mL(-1)) of VHSV IVb. Duplicate groups of fathead minnows (n = 15) were i.p. injected with (10(6.5) TCID(50) 100 microL) or waterborne exposed (10(6.5) TCID(50) mL(-1)). All experiments were performed with single-pass well water maintained at 12 degrees C. Following either i.p. or waterborne exposure, VHSV RNA was detectable in both rainbow trout and fathead minnows by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (nRT-PCR) as early as 4-7 days post-infection (p.i.). Infected fathead minnow and rainbow trout exhibited lesions characteristic of VHS at 9 and 15 days p.i., respectively. Route of exposure had little effect on the onset of clinical signs. Cumulative mean mortality in rainbow trout was 4.4%, 2.6%, 2.6% and less than 1% in the i.p., high, medium and low dose waterborne exposures, respectively. Cumulative average mortality of 50% and 13% occurred in i.p. and waterborne-exposed fathead minnows, respectively. VHSV was detected from pooled rainbow trout tissue by RT-PCR and virus isolation at 38 days p.i., but not at 74 days p.i., regardless of the exposure route. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with a rabbit antibody to VHSV IVb revealed the viral tissue tropisms following infection, with the identification of viral antigen in myocardium and necrotic branchial epithelium of both species and in gonadal tissue of fathead minnows.

We also compared the transcription of the two genes following infection of cells and determined the phosphorylation status and detergent solubility of the two proteins. Despite a total lack of homology with any available rhabdoviral sequence, the two VHSV proteins share comparable structural features with their respective VSV and RV equivalents. Thus, they are likely to exert similar functions. The amino acid sequence of both proteins is highly conserved between the European and the North American strains, indicating a probable common origin. The most remarkable features are that the virulent and avirulent strains differ in the location of the transcription start signal for the M2 gene and in TX-114 detergent solubility of the M2 protein. However, these differences are not paralleled with any observable change at the levels of M2 gene transcription, M2 protein expression, or virion maturation.

Recombinant infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus glycoprotein epitopes expressed in Aeromonas salmonicida induce protective immunity in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"Fragments of the glycoprotein genes of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) were cloned into a bacterial broad-host-range expression vector under the control of the plac promoter. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis with monoclonal antibodies specific to the glycoproteins demonstrated the inducible expression of the fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. Aeromonas salmonicida is the causative agent of furunculosis in salmonid fish. It was confirmed that an avirulent strain of A. salmonicida, A440, which contains a deletion in the structural gene for the paracrystalline surface protein array, will provide protective immunity against furunculosis when used as a live attenuated vaccine. The plasmid-encoded viral epitopes were then mobilized into A440 for use as a shuttle system for the expression of fragments of the glycoprotein genes of IHNV and VHSV. Vaccination of rainbow trout with A440 containing the viral epitopes resulted in the development of protective immunity against both VHSV and IHNV.

The BAFF / APRIL axis plays an important role in virus-induced peritoneal responses in rainbow trout.,"IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells have been recently demonstrated to be key regulators of peritoneal inflammation in teleost, as a large number of them occupy the peritoneal cavity after 48 h of antigenic stimulation. Despite this, the number of studies addressing the mechanism through which this cell population expands and differentiates in response to stimuli has been scarcely addressed. Because the BAFF/APRIL axis is known to play a major role in B cell survival and differentiation in mammals, we hypothesized that it could be affected in the peritoneal cavity in response to an inflammatory stimulus. To verify this hypothesis, we studied how BAFF, APRIL and the fish-specific related cytokine BALM as well as their putative receptors are regulated in rainbow trout after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). When the transcriptional analysis was performed in total cells from the peritoneum, we observed that VHSV provoked an up-regulation of both BAFF and BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) mRNA levels. However, when we examined how isolated peritoneal IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells were transcriptionally affected by VHSV i.p. injection, we found that APRIL, BALM and the transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) were also up-regulated in response to the virus. IgM<sup>-</sup> cells, on the other hand, only up-regulated BALM transcription in response to VHSV. Finally, to gain further insight on the role that these cytokines play in the peritoneum, we have studied their effect on the survival of peritoneal IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells. This work demonstrates a key role for the BAFF/APRIL axis in the peritoneal inflammatory response and contributes to further understanding how IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells are regulated at this specific peripheral site.","['APRIL', 'BAFF', 'BAFF receptors', 'BALM', 'Peritoneum', 'Rainbow trout', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)']","['Irene Soleto', 'Beatriz Abós', 'Rosario Castro', 'Lucia González', 'Carolina Tafalla', 'Aitor G Granja']"
Expansion and differentiation of IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells in the rainbow trout peritoneal cavity in response to different antigens.,"To date, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection seems to be the most effective vaccination route in aquaculture, as many i.p. administered fish vaccines are capable of conferring strong and long-lasting immune responses. Despite this, how peritoneal leukocytes are regulated upon antigen encounter has only been scarcely studied in fish. Although, in the past, myeloid cells were thought to be the main responders to peritoneal inflammation, a recent study revealed that IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells are one of the main cell types in the teleost peritoneal cavity in response to pathogenic bacteria. Thus, in the current work, we have focused on establishing how IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells are recruited into the peritoneum in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) comparing different antigens: Escherichia coli as a bacterial model, E. coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). In addition to studying their capacity to dominate the peritoneal cavity, we have established how these IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells are regulated in response to the different antigens, determining their levels of IgM secretion, surface MHC II expression, cell size and phagocytic abilities. Our results reveal that IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells are one of the main cell types amplified in the peritoneum in response to either bacterial or viral antigens and that these immunogenic stimulations provoke a differentiation of some of these cells towards plasmablasts/plasma cells whereas others seem to be implicated in antigen presentation. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the immune processes that regulate peritoneal inflammation in teleost fish.","['Escherichia coli', 'IgM(+) B cells', 'Peritoneum', 'Rainbow trout', 'Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)']","['Rosario Castro', 'Beatriz Abós', 'Lucia González', 'Aitor G Granja', 'Carolina Tafalla']"
Monthly occurrence and prevalence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in whiting Merlangius merlangus.,"A field survey was carried out to determine the occurrence and spread of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in whiting Merlangius merlangus (L.), a key prey species in the southeastern Black Sea region.

The samples were tested in duplicate using BF-2 and EPC cell lines for virus isolation. Positive cultures (those demonstrating cytopathic effect, [CPE]), were tested further with a commercial ELISA kit to confirm that the observed CPE was caused by VHSV. VHSV was detected in M. merlangus only between February and April following a drop in the surface water temperature to 9 degrees C.

Validation of real time RT-PCR applied to cell culture for diagnosis of any known genotype of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, is a major viral pathogen of cultured salmonid fish, and also infects a wide range of marine fish species.

Validation of the procedure, in terms of sensitivity, specificity and repeatability/reproducibility (R&R), was also performed. For this purpose, several pairs of primer amplifying regions corresponding to viral G and N genes were assayed. In the SYBR Green-based real time PCR, these primers failed to detect strains from some of the genotypes and/or showed low R&R. In order to improve the detection capacity, a multiplex procedure was designed, which enabled detection of all strains, with high R&R. The sensitivity of the procedure was measured, and a detection limit of 1 fg/microl of viral RNA or 10 copies of cloned plasmid was established.

Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype II isolated from European river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis in Finland during surveillance from 1999 to 2008.,"We examined the occurrence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in the main spawning stocks of wild European river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis in the rivers of Finland from 1999 to 2008. Pooled samples of internal organs (kidney, liver and heart or brain) from 2621 lampreys were examined for the presence of VHSV by standard virological techniques. VHSV was isolated from 5 samples from the rivers Lestijoki and Kalajoki, which flow from Finland into the Bothnian Bay of the Baltic Sea. The presence of VHSV was confirmed by immunofluorescent antibody technique (IFAT), ELISA and RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length VHSV glycoprotein (G) gene sequence revealed that the isolates were most closely related to the VHSV strain isolated in 1996 from herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus in the Eastern Gotland Basin of the Baltic Sea, and were therefore assigned to VHSV genotype II. The partial G gene sequences obtained (nt 1 to 672-1129) of all 5 lamprey VHSV isolates were identical, and so were the entire G genes (nt 1 to 1524) of 2 isolates sequenced. The virulence of one of the lamprey isolates was evaluated by an experimental infection trial in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss fry. No mortality was induced postinfection by waterborne and intraperitoneal challenge, respectively, while 2 genotype Id isolates originating from Finnish rainbow trout caused marked mortality under the same conditions. The infection in the European river lamprey is thought to be independent from the epidemic in farmed rainbow trout in Finnish brackish waters, because the isolates from rainbow trout were of a different genotype. This is the first report of VHSV found in the European river lamprey.

Persistence of the carrier status in haemorrhagic septicaemia (Pasteurella multocida serotype 6:B infection) in buffaloes.,"Fifty-seven young buffaloes were experimentally infected or naturally exposed to haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS). Of these animals 32 became immune carriers. They were observed in groups for periods up to 360 days to monitor the appearance of pasteurellae in the nasopharynx and antibody status. In most animals pasteurellae appeared in the nasopharynx for a short period initially and disappeared. The organism reappeared intermittently and the longest observed period of reappearance was 215 days after exposure. All animals showed rising antibody titres with a peak lasting for 150 to 180 days and declining thereafter. Pasteurellae persisted in the tonsils and were isolated from 20 out of 27 carriers after slaughter. The longest period when isolation was made after slaughter was 229 days. The organism lodged in the tonsils was unaffected by antibacterial therapy using drugs to which the organism displayed in vitro sensitivity. It is concluded that in HS, carrier animals exist in an active as well as a latent state, the former appearing for short intermittent periods between long latent periods, when pasteurellae continue to remain in the tonsils which constitute a long-term reservoir.",[],"['M C de Alwis', 'T G Wijewardana', 'A I Gomis', 'A A Vipulasiri']"
Pasteurella multocida infections in mice with reference to haemorrhagic septicaemia in cattle and buffalo.,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is an infectious disease of cattle and buffalo caused by particular serotypes of Pasteurella multocida and is one of the most economically important livestock diseases in South-East Asia. While HS has been recognized for many years, very little is understood about the disease, primarily because of the expense of cattle and a lack of suitable animal models. The suitability of using mice to study HS was assessed using parameters such as the critical pathogenic dose, kinetics of infection, pathology of disease and resistance to reinfection. Pasteurella multocida M1404, the type strain for Carter group B, the serotype responsible for Asian HS, was injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice. As few as 20 colony forming units produced an overwhelming septicaemia in mice in less than 30 h. The kinetics of infection demonstrated a very rapid in vivo multiplication rate. There was no evidence of inhibition of bacterial cell growth by natural host defence mechanisms, even with the very small inocula used. The gross pathology of the disease in mice was characterized by splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and petechial haemorrhages similar to that observed in cattle and buffalo with HS. Mice were found to develop a short-lived resistance to reinfection following a primary infection which had been successfully treated with antibiotics. The mouse would seem to provide an ideal tool by which to study HS, but warrant further studies in order to be able to critically assess it as a model for this economically important disease.",[],"['H J Dawkins', 'R B Johnson', 'T L Spencer', 'B Adler']"
Serological response of cattle to simultaneous vaccinations against foot-and-mouth disease and haemorrhagic septicaemia.,"In Malaysia, where vaccination campaigns against foot-and-mouth disease and haemorrhagic septicaemia are routinely carried out, it was desirable to determine whether it was safe and efficacious to administer both vaccines simultaneously. A trial group of 104 cattle was divided into three groups; group 1 animals received both vaccines simultaneously, group 2 animals received only foot-and-mouth disease vaccine and group 3 animals received only haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccine. The serological response to vaccinations was monitored at 0, 21 and 35 days by the virus neutralisation test for foot-and-mouth disease and the mouse-protection and indirect haemagglutination tests for haemorrhagic septicaemia. The simultaneous administration of the two inactivated vaccines produced no adverse effects and the serological response did not differ from the response to either vaccine given separately, thus indicating that cattle may be safely and effectively vaccinated simultaneously in this way.",[],"['P G Joseph', 'R S Hedger']"
Experimental transmission of VHSV genotype IVb by predation.,"Preliminary surveillance of wild baitfish during the 2006 viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus genotype IVb (VHSV IVb) outbreaks indicated Emerald Shiners Notropis atherinoides and Bluntnose Minnow Pimephales notatus were infected with high levels of VHSV without showing clinical signs of disease. The movement and use of baitfish was recognized as the most probable vector for the introduction of VHSV to inland waters, such as Conesus Lake and Skaneateles Lake in New York, Budd Lake in Michigan, and Little Lake Butte des Morts and Lake Winnebago in Wisconsin. While numerous government agencies implemented restrictions to stop the movement of potentially infected baitfish into new waters and prevent the spread of VHSV IVb, until now, studies to investigate whether these initial introductions were by an oral route of infection have not occurred. Our studies identified infected Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas as suitable vectors for transmitting VHSV IVb when fed to Tiger Muskellunge ( ♂ Northern Pike Esox lucius × ♀ Muskellunge Esox masquinongy) during laboratory trials. Six of 16 Tiger Muskellunge were infected with VHSV IVb after consumption of infected Fathead Minnows when assayed with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and viral isolation in cell culture. Weekly sampling of water and feces from these Tiger Muskellunge individually reared showed intermittent shedding of VHSV IVb. Those exposed to similarly VHSV IVb-inoculated fathead minnows by cohabitation only became infected in 1 case out of 16. A similar trial of 12 Tiger Muskellunge fed Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus that survived a VHSV IVb immersion challenge did not result in infection. Overall, our findings imply that consumption of infected wild baitfish may be a risk factor for introduction of VHSV.",[],"['Rodman G Getchell', 'Emily R Cornwell', 'Geoffrey H Groocock', 'Po Ting Wong', 'Laura L Coffee', 'Gregory A Wooster', 'Paul R Bowser']"
[Serum proteins of rainbow trout in viral hemorrhagic septicemia].,"Investigations on both healthy and sick of viral hemorrhagic septicemia artificially reared trouts aged one and three years were carried out. The total protein amount and the protein fractions were determined. It was established that in case of viral hemorrhagic septicemia the quantity of total protein in the blood serum is considerably reduced both in one year- and in three-year-old trouts. The study on protein fractions proved that the content of serum albumen sharply drops in sick trouts. The sick trouts have considerably higher alpha-globulin values than the healthy ones. beta-globulins are also increased in the fish suffering from septicemia. It was established that the beta 1:beta 2-globulin ratio in healthy one year- and three-year-old trouts is respectively 1.7:1 and 1.5:1. Higher values were established also for the gamma-globulin component in the blood serum of sick fish. In all investigations only one gamma-globulin fraction was assessed. The albumen-globulin coefficient in sick one year- and three-year-old trouts is 0.17 and 0.25, while in healthy fish of the same age it is 0.91 and 1.3 respectively.",[],"['G S Georgiev', 'I Kamenov']"
Binding of host iron-binding proteins and expression of iron-regulated membrane proteins by different serotypes of Pasteurella multocida causing haemorrhagic septicaemia.,"Pasteurella multocida strains of serotype B: 2,5, B: 3,4 and E: 2,5 are associated with haemorrhagic septicaemia in domestic and feral ruminants. These strains were investigated for their ability to bind transferrin, lactoferrin and haemoglobin and for their ability to use these host iron-binding proteins as a source of iron. All strains bound haemoglobin, none of the strains bound lactoferrin, whereas transferrin binding was restricted to serotype B: 2,5 strains. Growth experiments indicated that transferrin (serotype B: 2,5) and haemoglobin could restore bacterial growth under iron-depleted conditions.

Antibody response of rainbow trout with single or double infections involving viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus and infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus.,"Juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were experimentally infected by immersion with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) or with both viruses. The presence of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of infected fish were analysed by 50% plaque neutralization tests (50%PNT). In Group 1 (infected with VHSV) and Group 2 (infected with IHNV) neutralizing antibodies were found in 41% and 21% of the serum samples, respectively. No cross-reacting antibodies were found in these 2 groups. In Group 3 (infected with both viruses) 30% of the samples showed neutralizing antibodies against VHSV, 21% against IHNV and 12% against both viruses. Fish in Group 3 developed a double specific antibody reaction whose kinetics and intensity (mean of log10 titres) were similar to the antibody response of the single infected groups.",[],"['J M Fregeneda-Grandes', 'H F Skall', 'N J Olesen']"
Virulence and Antibiotic Resistance Profiles of <i>Cronobacter sakazakii</i> and <i>Enterobacter</i> spp. Involved in the Diarrheic Hemorrhagic Outbreak in Mexico.,"<i>Cronobacter</i> spp. are bacterial pathogens that cause neonatal meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis in infants with a lethality rate of 40-80%. Powdered infant formulas (PIF) have been implicated as the main vehicles of transmission. This pathogen can also cause infection through contaminated expressed breast milk, and it has been recovered from neonatal feeding tubes of neonates not fed reconstituted PIF and milk kitchen areas. This study analyzed antibiotic resistance profiles and the tissue virulence tests of <i>Cronobacter sakazakii</i> and <i>Enterobacter</i> spp. recovered from PIF, infant fecal matter's, and milk kitchen environment involved in a diarrheic hemorrhagic outbreak in 2011 in Mexico. The strains isolated from the outbreak had similar antibiotic resistance profiles and pathogenicity irrespective of isolation site, however, <i>C. sakazakii</i> strains isolated from PIF showed significantly higher invasive profiles than <i>Enterobacter</i> spp. (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and 83% were resistant to more than one antibiotic. The findings of this study can be used to complement existing information to better control <i>Cronobacter</i> and <i>Enterobacter</i> spp. contamination in PIF production, prevent its transmission, and improve infant food safety.","['Cronobacter sakazakii', 'Enterobacter hormaechei', 'antibiogram', 'powdered infant formula', 'virulence']","['Julio Parra-Flores', 'Juan Aguirre', 'Vijay Juneja', 'Emily E Jackson', 'Ariadnna Cruz-Córdova', 'Jesus Silva-Sanchez', 'Stephen Forsythe']"

"Molecular characterization of CD9 and CD63, two tetraspanin family members expressed in trout B lymphocytes.","Tetraspanins are a family of membrane-organizing proteins, characterized by the presence of four highly conserved transmembrane regions that mediate diverse physiological functions. In the current study, we have identified two novel tetraspanin members in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), homologs to mammalian CD9 and CD63. Both genes were expressed in muscle, skin, gills, hindgut, gonad, liver, spleen, head kidney, thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes. Throughout the early life cycle stages, CD9 mRNA levels significantly increased after first feeding, whereas CD63 transcription remained constant during all the developmental stages analyzed. In response to an experimental bath infection with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), CD9 transcription was down-regulated in the gills, while CD63 mRNA levels were down-regulated in the head kidney. Instead, when the virus was intraperitoneally injected, the transcription of both genes was significantly up-regulated in peritoneal cells at several days post-infection. Additionally, both genes were transcriptionally up-regulated in the muscle of trout injected with a VHSV DNA vaccine. To gain insight on the relation of these tetraspanins with B cell activity we determined their constitutive expression in naive IgM(+) populations from different sources and observed that both molecules were being transcribed by IgM(+) cells in different tissues. Furthermore, CD9 transcription was significantly down-regulated in splenic IgM(+) cells in response to in vitro VHSV exposure. Our results provide insights on the potential role of these tetraspanins on teleost B cell and antiviral immunity.

Relationship between active protection in vaccinated buffaloes against haemorrhagic septicaemia and passive mouse protection test or serum antibody titres.,"The relationship between the standard passive mouse protection test or serum antibody titres measured by indirect haemagglutination or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and active protection in buffaloes immunized with different types of haemorrhagic septicaemia bacterins was investigated.

Although the passive mouse protection and indirect haemagglutination tests carried out with the pre-challenge sera from vaccinated buffaloes revealed no relationship with active protection in buffaloes, a relationship was observed between the ELISA antibody titres and protection.

Estimates and Temporal Trend for US Nationwide 30-Day Hospital Readmission Among Patients With Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke.,"Readmission reduction is linked to improved quality of care, saves cost, and is a desirable patient-centered outcome. Nationally representative readmission metrics for patients with stroke are unavailable to date. Such estimates are necessary for benchmarking performance.To provide US nationwide estimates and a temporal trend for overall, planned, and potentially preventable 30-day hospital readmission among patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke; to investigate the association between hospitals' stroke discharge volume, teaching status, and 30-day readmission; and to highlight reasons for 30-day readmission and explore the association of 30-day readmission in terms of mortality, length of stay, and cost of care among patients with stroke.Cohort, year-wise analysis of the Nationwide Readmissions Database between January 1, 2010, and September 30, 2015. The setting was a population-based cohort study providing national estimates of 30-day readmission. The database represents 50% of all US hospitalizations from 22 geographically dispersed states. Participants were adult (≥18 years) patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hospitals were categorized by their annual stroke discharge volume and were classified as teaching hospitals if they had an American Medical Association-approved residency program or had a ratio of full-time equivalent interns and residents to beds of 0.25 or higher.Readmission was defined as any admission within 30 days of index hospitalization discharge. Using Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services-defined algorithms, events were classified as planned or unplanned and as potentially preventable.Based on study criteria, 2 078 854 eligible patients were included (mean [SE] age, 70.02 [0.07] years; 51.9% female). Thirty-day readmission was highest for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (13.70%; 95% CI, 13.40%-13.99%), followed by patients with acute ischemic stroke (12.44%; 95% CI, 12.33%-12.55%) and patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (11.48%; 95% CI, 11.01%-11.96%). On average, there was a 3.3% annual decline in readmission between 2010 and 2014, which was statistically significant for the period of investigation (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97). Patients discharged from nonteaching hospitals with high stroke discharge volume were at a significantly higher risk of 30-day readmission, and the top 2 reasons for readmission were acute cerebrovascular disease and septicemia.This study suggests that nationally representative readmission metrics can be used to benchmark hospitals' performance, and a temporal trend of 3.3% may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of readmission reduction strategies.",[],"['Arvind B Bambhroliya', 'John P Donnelly', 'Eric J Thomas', 'Jon E Tyson', 'Charles C Miller', 'Louise D McCullough', 'Sean I Savitz', 'Farhaan S Vahidy']"
Highly sensitive immunoassay for direct diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic septicemia which uses antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies.,"An antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the detection of the viral nucleocapsid (anti-N system) was developed for the diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic septicemia. Four monoclonal antibodies directed against the viral nucleocapsid were produced; they all recognized the four viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) serotypes. Three of these monoclonal antibodies were used in a new antigen capture ELISA. The efficiency of the anti-N system in detecting purified and crude viruses as well as the virus in infected-organ extracts and infected blood was compared with that of a recently described antigen capture ELISA based on the detection of viral envelope glycoprotein Gp (anti-G system). For the detection of purified virus, the anti-N system was found to be as sensitive as the anti-G system (detection limit, 1 ng of total viral protein per ml), but the anti-N system was much more sensitive than the anti-G system for the detection of crude VHSV I (detection limits, 1 x 10(4) PFU/ml versus 5 x 10(5) PFU/ml). In organ extracts, VHSV I could be detected by both systems 3 days postinfection. The signal for the assay of VHSV I in blood 24 h postinfection was higher with the anti-N system than the anti-G system. Furthermore, VHSV I could be detected in 80% of the brain samples of surviving trout by the anti-N system and also by the anti-G system, but with a lower signal. In conclusion, we have developed a highly sensitive immunoassay for VHSV I that is more rapid and easier to perform than the currently used plaque assay.",[],"['C Mourton', 'B Romestand', 'P de Kinkelin', 'J Jeffroy', 'R Le Gouvello', 'B Pau']"
Viral hemorrhagic septicemia of rainbow trout: selection of a thermoresistant virus variant and comparison of polypeptide synthesis with the wild-type virus strain.,"Serial passage of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus at gradually increasing temperature selected for a variant virus that replicates at 25 degrees C and has a low pathogenicity for rainbow trout. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus-specific polypeptide synthesis was examined in epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells infected with either a wild-type strain or a thermoresistant variant. The wild-type N and M1 proteins were synthesized throughout the course of infection, whereas L, G, and M2 were more actively translated later in the replication cycle. The wild-type strain was more cytotoxic at 25 than at 14 degrees C despite the fact that no translation could be evidenced when the temperature was raised. When epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells were infected with the variant virus, the kinetic study was obstructed since protein synthesis was difficult to observe by the pulse method at a low multiplicity of infection and aborted when the multiplicity of infection was raised. The variant was less cytotoxic at 25 degrees C than wild-type virus.",[],"['P de Kinkelin', 'M Bearzotti-Le Berre', 'J Bernard']"
The glycoprotein of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV): antigenicity and role in virulence.,"In order to study the antigenic structure of the G protein of VHSV, we produced several anti-G monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and used 4 neutralizing MAbs (NMAbs) to select resistant (MAR) mutants. Each MAR mutant was confronted with the 4 NMAbs in a neutralization test, and also with our panel of MAbs in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis to determine the extent of their relatedness. Determination of the sequence of the entire G gene of representative MAR mutants allowed us to map the mutations responsible for the resistant phenotypes. We identified several locations on the G protein sequence, which represent, most probably, critical positions within the binding sites of the neutralizing MAbs. In addition, the MAR mutants selected with a cross-reactive MAb exhibited a reduced pathogenicity for fish. This indicated that the regions bearing the point mutations selected with MAb C10 were probably involved in the determination of the virulent phenotype.",[],"['M Béarzotti', 'A F Monnier', 'P Vende', 'J Grosclaude', 'P de Kinkelin', 'A Benmansour']"
Characterization of immune response and duration of protection in buffaloes immunized with haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccines.,"Two of the three buffaloes immunized with a non-adjuvanted broth bacterin were found to be protected against experimental challenge at 6 weeks but not at 3 months post-challenge. Similarly all buffaloes (4/4) immunized with alum-precipitated vaccine were protected at 6 months but only 1 of the 2 vaccinated animals were protected at 12 months post-immunization. On the other hand, buffaloes immunized with an oil adjuvant and a double emulsion vaccine were completely protected at 12 months post-immunization. Statistically significant differences between immunized versus non-immune animals became evident at 3 months post-immunization, although analysis of cumulative antibody titres of pre-challenge sera of vaccinated buffaloes surviving versus those succumbing to experimental challenge revealed significant by higher antibody titres in the former as compared to the latter group. These results suggested that there was a relationship between ELISA antibody titres and active protection in buffaloes. There also appeared to be a relationship between cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity and active protection in buffaloes. Preliminary analysis of the antibody isotype distribution in the pre-challenge sera of 2 buffaloes vaccinated with the oil adjuvant vaccine revealed predominance of IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses whose role in protection against haemorrhagic septicaemia was not eludicated.",[],"['S Chandrasekaran', 'L Kennett', 'P C Yeap', 'N Muniandy', 'B Rani', 'T K Mukkur']"

The suspect false negative isolates were passaged in mice and retested in the HS ELISA with the same result. Immunoelectron microscopy was used to examine further these suspect HS-causing strains. Monoclonal antibodies and protein A-gold showed that the suspect negative organisms were a mixture of phenotypes with less than 10 per cent, and usually less than 2 per cent, of the population expressing HS-associated epitopes. The degree of staining on the organisms expressing the HS-epitopes was of the same intensity as the positive control organism.

Fatal fibrino-hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia associated with Morganella morganii in a bottlenose dolphin: a case report.,"A 5 yr old, 184 kg, and 262 cm total length female bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus was found dead in a display after bloody discharge from the blowhole was observed 3 h prior to death. Pathological examination revealed fibrinous bronchopneumonia with prominent areas of necrosis (sequestra) and numerous Gram-negative bacilli within alveoli and in blood vessels of the lungs and liver and between muscle fibers. The cause of death was attributed to septicemia. Often, cases of fibrinous bronchopneumonia are characterized by bacteremia in the latter stages of infection, resulting in the death of the animal. Septicemia likely accounts for the ecchymoses and petechiae noted on the spleen, pancreas, forestomach, lungs, visceral peritoneum, and small intestine. Additional lesions included hemothorax, stable red frothy fluid in the trachea, and lymphoid depletion in the spleen and lymph nodes. Pure growth of Morganella morganii was isolated from the lungs, blood, liver, and blowhole mucosa. Sequencing of 16s rRNA of the isolated bacteria showed more than 99.6% identity with M. morganii strain FDAARGOS_172.

<i>In vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> phenotypic differences between Great Lakes VHSV genotype IVb isolates with sequence types vcG001 and vcG002.,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is an aquatic rhabdovirus first recognized in farmed rainbow trout in Denmark. In the past decade, a new genotype of this virus, IVb was discovered in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin and has caused several massive die-offs in some of the 28 species of susceptible North American freshwater fishes. Since its colonization of the Great Lakes, several closely related sequence types within genotype IVb have been reported, the two most common of which are vcG001 and vcG002. These sequence types have different spatial distributions in the Great Lakes. The aim of this study was to determine whether the genotypic differences between representative vcG001 (isolate MI03) and vcG002 (isolate 2010-030 #91) isolates correspond to phenotypic differences in terms of virulence using both an <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> approach. <i>In vitro</i> infection of epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC), bluegill fry (BF-2), and Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE) cells demonstrated some differences in onset and rate of growth in EPC and BF-2 cells, without any difference in the quantity of RNA produced. <i>In vivo</i> infection of round gobies (<i>Neogobius melanostomus</i>) via immersion exposure to different concentrations of vcG001 or vcG002 caused a significantly greater mortality in round gobies exposed to 10<sup>2</sup> plaque forming units ml<sup>-1</sup> of vcG001.

European freshwater VHSV genotype Ia isolates divide into two distinct subpopulations.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS), caused by the novirhabdovirus VHSV, often leads to significant economic losses to European rainbow trout production. The virus isolates are divided into 4 distinct genotypes with additional subgroups including sublineage Ia, isolates of which are the main source of outbreaks in European rainbow trout farming. A significant portion of Danish rainbow trout farms have been considered endemically infected with VHSV since the first disease outbreak was observed in the 1950s. However, following a series of sanitary programs starting in 1965, VHSV has not been detected in Denmark since January 2009. Full-length G-genes of all Danish VHSV isolates that were submitted for diagnostic analyses in the period 2004-2009 were sequenced and analysed. All 58 Danish isolates from rainbow trout grouped with sublineage Ia isolates. Furthermore, VHSV isolates from infected Danish freshwater catchments appear to have evolved into a distinct clade within sublineage Ia, herein designated clade Ia-1, whereas trout isolates originating from other continental European countries cluster in another distinct clade, designated clade Ia-2. In addition, phylogenetic analyses indicate that VHSV Ia-1 strains have caused a few outbreaks in Germany and the UK. It is likely that viruses have been transmitted from infected site(s) out of the Danish environment, although a direct transmission pathway has not been identified. Furthermore, VHSV Ia-2 isolates seem to have been transmitted to Denmark at least once. Interestingly, one viral isolate possibly persisted in a Danish watershed for nearly 4 yr without detection whereas other subclades of VHSV isolates appear to have been eliminated, probably because of implemented eradication procedures.",[],"['S Kahns', 'H F Skall', 'R S Kaas', 'H Korsholm', 'B Bang Jensen', 'S P Jonstrup', 'M J Dodge', 'K Einer-Jensen', 'D Stone', 'N J Olesen']"

Rapid identification of Pasteurella multocida organisms responsible for haemorrhagic septicaemia using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is caused by specific serotypes of Pasteurella multocida and is one of the major economic diseases of cattle and buffalo in South East Asia. Definitive diagnosis of the disease-causing organism with the available methods is labour intensive and not totally reliable, consequently, an ELISA system to identify P multocida organisms which cause HS was developed. One hundred and twenty-four P multocida isolates were tested, 58 were type strains and 66 were field isolates. Analysis of these strains indicated the assay had a specificity of 99 per cent and sensitivity of at least 86 per cent. The sensitivity could be an underestimate, as five isolates assumed to be false negative reactions may not all be HS-causing strains.

In vitro inhibition of the replication of haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) and African swine fever virus (ASFV) by extracts from marine microalgae.,"We have screened for in vitro inhibition of viral replication with extracts from the following marine microalgae: Porphyridium cruentum, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Tetraselmis suecica, Chlorella autotrophica, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Dunaliella bardawil, Isochrysis galbana, Isochrysis galbana var Tiso, Ellipsoidon sp. and Tetraselmis tetrathele. We have used as viral models two enveloped viruses of significant economic importance, the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) of salmonid fish and the African swine fever virus (ASFV). The aqueous extracts from P. cruentum, C. autotrophica and Ellipsoidon sp., produced a significant inhibition of the in vitro replication of both viruses in a dose-dependent manner. That this inhibition could be due to sulfated polysaccharides was suggested because the same pattern of viral inhibition was obtained by using exocellular extracts from microalgae enriched in these compounds and/or dextran sulfate of high molecular weight. However, the inhibition of viral replication did not correlate with the percentage of sulfatation of the exocellular polysaccharides. Extracts from marine microalgae may have prophylactic utility against fish and mammalian viral diseases.",[],"['J Fabregas', 'D García', 'M Fernandez-Alonso', 'A I Rocha', 'P Gómez-Puertas', 'J M Escribano', 'A Otero', 'J M Coll']"

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia of rainbow trout: relation between the G polypeptide and antibody production in protection of the fish after infection with the F25 attenuated variant.,"A nonpathogenic variant of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus has been selected which immunizes fish against a subsequent challenge with the wild-type virus strain. In this paper, we demonstrate that both the variant and the wild-type virus strains multiplied in spleen and kidney of infected fish, but the virus yield was lower for the variant and soon dropped below the sensitivity of our titration technique, which indicates that an early mechanism prevents the establishment of septicemia. This early mechanism could also be responsible for early protection since fish were already immunized 48 h postinfection with the variant. In a second step antibodies relayed that first defence mechanism to ensure long-lasting immunity. Antisera collected after immunization by the variant or the wild-type virus strain cross-reacted poorly in neutralization tests, which is in agreement with results obtained with plant lectins and proves that the variant is modified in its antigenic properties.",[],"['J Bernard', 'P de Kinkelin', 'M Bearzotti-Le Berre']"
Saigas on the brink: Multidisciplinary analysis of the factors influencing mass mortality events.,"In 2015, more than 200,000 saiga antelopes died in 3 weeks in central Kazakhstan. The proximate cause of death is confirmed as hemorrhagic septicemia caused by the bacterium <i>Pasteurella multocida</i> type B, based on multiple strands of evidence. Statistical modeling suggests that there was unusually high relative humidity and temperature in the days leading up to the mortality event; temperature and humidity anomalies were also observed in two previous similar events in the same region. The modeled influence of environmental covariates is consistent with known drivers of hemorrhagic septicemia. Given the saiga population's vulnerability to mass mortality and the likely exacerbation of climate-related and environmental stressors in the future, management of risks to population viability such as poaching and viral livestock disease is urgently needed, as well as robust ongoing veterinary surveillance. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to research mass mortality events under rapid environmental change.",[],"['Richard A Kock', 'Mukhit Orynbayev', 'Sarah Robinson', 'Steffen Zuther', 'Navinder J Singh', 'Wendy Beauvais', 'Eric R Morgan', 'Aslan Kerimbayev', 'Sergei Khomenko', 'Henny M Martineau', 'Rashida Rystaeva', 'Zamira Omarova', 'Sara Wolfs', 'Florent Hawotte', 'Julien Radoux', 'Eleanor J Milner-Gulland']"
[Significance of Urological Surgical Treatment for Viral Hemorrhagic Cystitis after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation].,"This study investigated the significance of urological surgical intervention for viral hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). A total of 1, 024 patients underwent allo-HSCT at our medical center between January 2006 and July 2014. In the 6 patients (0.58%) who required urological surgical treatment for viral HC, we retrospectively analyzed patient characteristics and outcomes. Two patients underwent nephrostomy for bilateral hydronephrosis due to bladder tamponade. One of these patients showed no improvement in renal function, graft versus host disease worsened and he died on postoperative day (POD) 5. The other patient displayed improved renal function but hematuria did not improve, and total cystectomy was required. To control bleeding, we performed transurethral electrocoagulation (TUC) on 3 patients, and total cystectomy was performed on 2 patients. All 3 patients who underwent TUC had BK virus HC. Two of these patients experienced marked improvement in hematuria from immediately after surgery. Hemostasis was only temporary in the other patient, who eventually died due to septicemia on POD 24. The 2 patients who underwent total cystectomy had adenovirus HC. Both experienced secondary hemorrhage postoperatively and required further surgery. Eventually, one died due to postoperative bleeding on POD 1, and one died due to postoperative pneumonia on POD 57. Urological surgical treatment for HC was effective in some cases, but the ultimate outcome greatly depends on the general condition of the patient and treatment of the underlying hematological disorder. TUC may be considered for HC (particularly BK virus HC), but total cystectomy (especially inaden ovirus HC) should be avoided.",[],"['Kazuhiro Kurosawa', 'Shinji Urakami', 'Kazuya Ishiwata', 'Jinpei Miyagawa', 'Kazushige Sakaguchi', 'Masashi Fujioka', 'Hirokatsu Murata', 'Naoko Inoshita', 'Shuichi Taniguchi', 'Toshikazu Okaneya']"
Comparative susceptibility of turbot Scophthalmus maximus to different genotypes of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.,"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) disease has exerted a significant impact on the development of turbot aquaculture in the British Isles. The source of such outbreaks is believed to be naturally occurring marine isolates of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), which are endemic in the marine environment of Northern Europe. Genetic studies have classified these marine VHSV isolates into genotypes based on their geographic rather than host-species origin. This study set out to explore the hypothesis that susceptibility of turbot to VHSV might be genotype specific. Immersion infection of turbot with a range of isolates, selected according to genotype, identified significant differences between susceptibility and genotype. Viruses belonging to Genotypes Ib (Baltic marine isolates) and III (North Sea/E. Atlantic marine isolates) caused significantly higher mortality than isolates from Genotypes Ia (isolates associated with rainbow trout aquaculture) and II (Baltic marine isolates). This study serves to highlight the importance of thoroughly investigating the susceptibility of any given species to the range of pathogens to which they might be exposed prior to considering them resistant to any disease. Furthermore, it highlights different risk factors that might be associated with turbot aquaculture undertaken in different environments. Finally, an increased knowledge of the relative virulence of different isolates in turbot will assist in understanding virulence determinants, which could lead to advances in disease control.",[],"['M Snow', 'J A King', 'A Garden', 'A M Shanks', 'R S Raynard']"
"Cell-mediated cytotoxicity in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, infected with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.","Mammalian cytotoxic T cells as part of the adaptive immune system recognize virus-infected target cells by binding of their T-cell receptors (TCR) to classical MHC class I molecules loaded with viral peptides. Our previous studies have shown that the allele of the single dominant polymorphic classical MHC class I locus Onmy-UBA is identical in the rainbow trout clone C25 and in the permanent rainbow trout cell line RTG-2. This enabled us to develop an assay to measure antiviral cytotoxicity in rainbow trout using a system of MHC class I-matched effector and target cells. Peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) isolated from low dose viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV)-infected rainbow trout killed MHC class I-matched and later also xenogeneic MHC class I-mismatched VHSV-infected cells. When compared to PBL from uninfected control fish PBL from infected fish showed a higher transcriptional level of the CD8alpha gene which is a typical marker for mammalian cytotoxic T cells. Concurrently, the expression of the natural killer cell enhancement factor (NKEF)-like gene was enhanced as measured by real-time RT - PCR. Taken together, these results suggest that both innate and adaptive cell-mediated immune responses represented by NK and cytotoxic T cells, respectively, are triggered after VHSV infection. PBL that were able to kill VHSV-infected MHC class I-mismatched xenogeneic cells were generated later during infection than PBL capable of lysing VHSV-infected MHC class I-matched targets. This is contradictory to the generally accepted rule that innate immune mechanisms represent the first line of defence after viral infections.",[],"['Katrin Utke', 'Sven Bergmann', 'Niels Lorenzen', 'Bernd Köllner', 'Mitsuru Ototake', 'Uwe Fischer']"
Interaction of the attenuated recombinant rIHNV-Gvhsv GFP virus with macrophages from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"One of the most important threats to the salmonid aquaculture industry is infection caused by novirhabdoviruses such as infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) or viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV). Using reverse genetics, an avirulent recombinant rIHNV-Gvhsv GFP strain was generated, which was able to replicate as effectively as wild type IHNV in a fish cell line and in macrophages. Although this recombinant virus induced protective responses against IHNV and VHSV, the response did not involve the production of antibodies or modulate the expression of some antiviral genes. To determine the immune mechanisms underlying the protection conferred by the rIHNV-Gvhsv GFP virus, different immune parameters (NO production, respiratory burst activity and the induction of apoptosis) were assessed in the macrophage population. The results obtained in the present work may indicate that the Nv protein could be important in the modulation of NO and ROS production. rIHNV-Gvhsv GFP did not appear to have a clear effect on nitric oxide production or apoptosis. However, an increased respiratory burst activity (with levels induced by the recombinant virus significantly higher than the levels induced by the wild type virus), suggests a stimulation of the macrophage population, which could be related to the protection against virulent viruses.",[],"['Alejandro Romero', 'Sonia Dios', 'Michel Bremont', 'Antonio Figueras', 'Beatriz Novoa']"

Complete genome sequence of Vibrio vulnificus FORC_017 isolated from a patient with a hemorrhagic rash after consuming raw dotted gizzard shad.,"Vibrio vulnificus, a resident in the human gut, is frequently found in seafood, causing food-borne illnesses including gastroenteritis and severe septicemia. While V. vulnificus has been known to be one of the major food-borne pathogens, pathogenicity and virulence factors are not fully understood yet. To extend our understanding of the pathogenesis of V. vulnificus at the genomic level, the genome of V. vulnificus FORC_017 isolated from a female patient experiencing a hemorrhagic rash was completely sequenced and analyzed.Three discontinuous contigs were generated from a hybrid assembly using Illumina MiSeq and PacBio platforms, revealing that the genome of the FORC_017 consists of two circular chromosomes and a plasmid. Chromosome I consists of 3,253,417-bp (GC content 46.49 %) containing 2943 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) and chromosome II of 1,905,745-bp (GC content 46.90 %) containing 1638 ORFs. The plasmid pFORC17 consists of 70,069-bp (GC content 43.77 %) containing 84 ORFs. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) value of the FORC_017 and CMCP6 strains was 98.53, suggesting that they are closely related.Pathogenesis-associated genes including vvhA, rtx gene cluster, and various hemolysin genes were present in FORC_017. In addition, three complete secretion systems (Type I, II and VI) as well as iron uptake-related genes for virulence of the FORC_017 were detected, suggesting that this strain is pathogenic. Further comparative genome analysis revealed that FORC_017 and CMCP6 share major toxin genes including vvhA and rtx for pathogenesis activities. The genome information of the FORC_017 provides novel insights into pathogenicity and virulence factors of V. vulnificus.","['Genome sequencing', 'Hemolysin', 'Hybrid assembly', 'Pathogenesis', 'Secretion system', 'Vibrio vulnificus', 'Virulence factor']","['Han Young Chung', 'You-Tae Kim', 'Suyeon Kim', 'Eun Jung Na', 'Hye-Jin Ku', 'Keun Hwa Lee', 'Sang Taek Heo', 'Sangryeol Ryu', 'Heebal Kim', 'Sang Ho Choi', 'Ju-Hoon Lee']"

Detection of hemorrhagic septicemia virus of salmonid fishes by use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay containing high sodium chloride concentration and two noncompetitive monoclonal antibodies against early viral nucleoproteins.,"Inclusion of high-ionic strength buffers helped us to develop a sandwich ELISA to detect hemorrhagic septicemia virus (HSV) in cell culture and infected trout tissue extracts. For maximal sensitivity of 0.1 to 0.2 ng/well/100 microliters or about 10 to 50 TCID50/well/100 microliters, trout extracts were diluted 1:1 and assayed for the earliest synthesized nucleoprotein N. Simultaneous binding of the N protein from HSV in the sample to the wells coated with monoclonal antibody (2D5 against the N protein) and to the peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody (2C9 against the N protein) proceeded during a 2-hour incubation at 20 to 22 C (room temperature). The response was linear between 6 to 60 ng/well of purified virus. Monoclonal antibodies used were noncompetitive with each other and reacted with F1, F2, 23.75, and 5 Spanish isolates of HSV, but not with infectious hematopoietic necrosis or infectious pancreatic necrosis viruses.

Susceptibility of trout kidney macrophages to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus.,Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) lysed the macrophages from rainbow trout kidney cultures either isolated by plastic adherence or stimulated with purified glycoprotein G from VHSV. The trout macrophages supported the replication of VHSV as tested by cell culture and by sandwich ELISA of the supernatants from infected cultures. VHSV-infected macrophages showed a decrease in both acridine-orange fluorescence and average size. Immunofluorescence studies with flow cytometry showed positive membrane staining with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) anti-N and anti-G VHSV.

Stimulation of adherent cells by addition of purified proteins of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus to trout kidney cell cultures.,"Purified proteins of the virus causing viral hemorrhagic septicemia in the trout were added to cultures on semisolid medium of leukocytes obtained from either healthy or immunized rainbow trout. Adherent cells were specifically stimulated by the glycoprotein of the viral spikes and, to a lesser extent, by the nucleoproteins. In contrast, a specific memory response was associated more with the nucleoproteins than with the glycoprotein when leukocytes from trout immunized with the virus were employed.

Comparisons of Pasteurella multocida lipopolysaccharides by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine relationship between group B and E hemorrhagic septicemia strains and serologically related group A strains.,"Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) purified from 16 reference somatic serotypes of Pasteurella multocida were examined and compared by discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Resolution of LPS patterns in a gel was optimum when sample wells were cast separately from the stacking gel and the running gel consisted of 15% T (total monomer) polyacrylamide and 4 M deionized urea. Band patterns of P. multocida LPSs in a gel differed from control Salmonella minnesota wild-type and core mutant LPSs. Although the band patterns and mobilities of LPSs from some P. multocida reference serotypes were similar, none were identical. Evidence for O antigens similar to those produced by enterobacteria was not observed. Proteinase K digestion of whole P. multocida cells resulted in LPS band patterns similar to those of purified LPS. The presence or absence of a capsule on a strain had no major influence on band patterns in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Comparisons of LPS patterns of group B and E hemorrhagic septicemia strains with those of serologically related group A strains of P. multocida indicated that they were similar.

Affected fish exhibited congestion of internal organs; the inner wall of the swim bladder was thickened and contained numerous budding, fluid-filled vesicles. A virus was isolated using fish cell lines inoculated with a homogenate of kidney and spleen tissues from affected fish. Focal areas of cell rounding and granulation appeared as early as 24 h post-inoculation and expanded rapidly to destroy the entire cell sheet by 96 h. Electron microscopy revealed virions that were 170-180 nm in length by 60-70 nm in width having a bullet-shaped morphology typical of rhabdoviruses. The virus was confirmed as VHSV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

Mutations in the glycoprotein of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus that affect virulence for fish and the pH threshold for membrane fusion.,"To study the molecular basis of virulence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), we used a cross-reactive neutralizing MAb to select MAb-resistant (MAR) mutants with reduced pathogenicity for fish. From sequence determination of the G gene of MAR mutants, attenuated laboratory variant and avirulent field strains, we identified two distant regions of the glycoprotein associated with virulence: region I (aa 135-161), homologous to the putative fusion peptide of both rabies virus (RV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and region II (surrounding aa 431-433), homologous to RV and VSV domains controlling the conformational changes necessary for the fusion process to take place. Simultaneous mutations in both regions resulted in the most attenuated phenotype and we obtained genetic evidence that regions I and II may be structurally linked. As the MAR mutants had mutations in or near domains involved in fusion, the fusion properties of VHSV and its variants were analysed. This work allowed us to postulate that the fusion domain of VHSV is probably constituted of two distinct regions of the protein connected through a disulfide bridge between cysteines 110 and 152. Finally, we obtained evidence suggesting that the pH threshold for fusion is a determinant for virulence: restriction of fusion to a more acidic pH was associated with attenuation for the variant tr25 which had a shift of the threshold for maximal fusion from pH 6.30 (for the parental strain) to pH 6.00; conversely, two field strains which had maximal fusion at pH 6.60 were the most virulent.",[],"['Y Gaudin', 'P de Kinkelin', 'A Benmansour']"
