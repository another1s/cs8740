6,Electromyographic analysis of the masseter and temporal muscles in oralized deaf individuals.,"Deaf individuals show a number of difficulties related to the functionality of the stomatognathic system, mainly by reason of the little or no use of facial musculature during speech either due to the use of sign language or to the difficulty that these individuals have in articulating words. The stomatognathic system muscles play important roles in functions such as mastication, deglutition, and phonation. This study aimed to assess, by means of computerized bilateral electromyography (EMG), masseter and temporal muscles of 12 oralized deaf individuals in clinical activities that involve part of this masticatory musculature and compare this system's functionality with that of 12 normal listening individuals, performing the same activities. An 8-channel K6-I EMG Light Channel Surface Electromyography device was used (Myo-Tronics Co.Seattle, WA, USA), in addition to disposable double electrodes covered with silver chloride (Duotrodes; Myo-tronics Co., Seattle, WA) containing a conductor gel (Myogel- Myo-tronics Co., Seatlle, WA). The averaged rectified EMG values were normalized with reference to the EMG amplitude induced by a maximum bite force. The statistical analysis confirmed that there were any significant differences between the groups, clinical activities, and muscles, and also effects of interaction among them. The analysis made use of Variance Analysis (ANOVA). Significant differences (p < 0.01) for both muscles were found among the clinical conditions, with deaf individuals showing greater electromyographic activity for both muscles for the clinical activity protrusion. Deaf individuals showed a lower muscular activity for clinical activities that demanded a greater masseter and temporal muscular activity such as mastication, mouth opening and closing, and dental compression. Greater electromyographic values were found for both deaf individuals and healthy controls during clinical activities of mastication and dental compression. Based on the obtained data, we concluded that deaf individuals showed a lower activity of the masticatory musculature than healthy individuals; the differences were significant at the level of p < 0.01 between the performed clinical activities; and all deaf individuals and healthy controls showed greater electromyographic values for mastication and dental compression."
6,Avoidable emergency department visits: a starting point.,"To better characterize and understand the nature of a very conservative definition of 'avoidable' emergency department (ED) visits in the United States to provide policymakers insight into what interventions can target non-urgent ED visits.We performed a retrospective analysis of a very conservative definition of 'avoidable' ED visits using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2005 to 2011.We examined a total of 115 081 records, representing 424 million ED visits made by patients aged 18-64 years who were seen in the ED and discharged home.We defined 'avoidable' as ED visits that did not require any diagnostic or screening services, procedures or medications, and were discharged home.In total, 3.3% (95% CI: 3.0-3.7) of all ED visits were 'avoidable.' The top five chief complaints included toothache, back pain, headache, other symptoms/problems related to psychosis and throat soreness. Alcohol abuse, dental disorders and depressive disorders were among the top three ICD-9 discharge diagnoses. Alcohol-related disorders and mood disorders accounted for 6.8% (95% CI: 5.7-8.0) of avoidable visits, and dental disorders accounted for 3.9% (95% CI: 3.0-4.8) of CCS-grouped discharge diagnoses.A significant number of 'avoidable' ED visits were for mental health and dental conditions, which the ED is not fully equipped to treat. Our findings provide a better understanding of what policy initiatives could potentially reduce these 'avoidable' ED visits to address the gaps in our healthcare system, such as increased access to mental health and dental care."
6,Objective identification of dental abnormalities with multispectral fluorescence imaging.,"Sensitive methods that can enable early detection of dental diseases (caries and calculus) are desirable in clinical practice. Optical spectroscopic approaches have emerged as promising alternatives owing to their wealth of molecular information and lack of sample preparation requirements. In the present study, using multispectral fluorescence imaging, we have demonstrated that dental caries and calculus can be objectively identified on extracted tooth. Spectral differences among control, carious and calculus conditions were attributed to the porphyrin pigment content, which is a byproduct of bacterial metabolism. Spectral maps generated using different porphyrin bands offer important clues to the spread of bacterial infection. Statistically significant differences utilizing fluorescence intensity ratios were observed among three groups. In contrast to laser induced fluorescence, these methods can provide information about exact spread of the infection and may aid in long term dental monitoring. Successful adoption of this approach for routine clinical usage can assist dentists in implementing timely remedial measures."
6,The effects of oral health on systemic health.,"The oral cavity is the intersection of medicine and dentistry and the window into the general health of a patient. Hundreds of diseases and medications impact the oral cavity, and pathologic conditions in the mouth have a greater systemic impact than many providers appreciate. It is unclear whether there is true causality or just an association between periodontal disease and certain other systemic conditions, including atherosclerotic vascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, pregnancy-related complications, osteoporosis, and kidney disease. Diabetes has a true bidirectional relationship with periodontal disease, and there is strong evidence that treating one condition positively impacts the other. A shared trait of periodontal disease and these medical conditions is that they are chronic conditions that take a long time to develop and become clinically significant. Primary prevention-treating the patient prior to the onset of symptoms, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetic complications, or significant periodontal disease-is the challenge. Complications associated with these conditions cause significant morbidity and mortality and are incredibly costly to the healthcare system. Unfortunately, a lack of access to primary medical or dental care prevents some patients from engaging the system until a negative event has occurred. Despite the absence of clear evidence of causality and the direct impact of treatments, the consequences of these chronic conditions for the population are well understood. Dentists, family physicians, and all primary care providers must increase their collaboration and communication to maximize the benefit to patients."
6,Use of light-cured resin to manufacture occlusal splints: report of two cases.,"This article presents selected cases of patients with functional disorders of the stomatognathic system. This group of patients had a need to made different types of removable occlusal splints. In the past, occlusal appliances were made mostly using self-cured acrylate materials, which for many years had no replacements. The rapid development of dental materials technology led to creation of thermo-formable materials and resins, which can successfully replace traditional acrylic materials in daily clinical practice. A practical application of light-cured resin in the fabrication of the occlusal splints in two clinical cases is reported and discussed herein."
6,Behavioral problems and emotional stress in children with bruxism.,"Bruxism has a multifactorial etiology, and psychosocial factors have been considered to increase the risk of occurrence of this parafunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavior profile of a group of children diagnosed with bruxism. Eighty 7-11-year-old children of both genders (mean age 8.8 years) first recruited as eligible participants. Twenty-nine children (18 males and 11 females) whose parents/guardians reported to present frequent episodes of tooth grinding/clenching while awake or during sleep (at least 3 nights a week) in the previous 3 months were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of bruxism was established based on the parents/guardians' report about the children's behavior, habits and possible discomforts in the components of the stomatognathic system allied to the presence of signs and symptoms such as pain on the masticatory muscles, masseter muscle hypertrophy, wear facets, fractures of restorations, dental impressions on the cheek mucosa and tongue. As part of the psychological evaluation, the Rutter's Child Behavior Scale-A2 was applied to the parents/caregivers (one for each child) and the Child Stress Scale was applied to the children. Data were analyzed descriptively based on the frequency of each studied variable. Twenty-four (82.76%) children needed psychological or psychiatric intervention; 17 of them presented neurotic disorders and 7 children presented antisocial disorders. Six (20.70%) children presented significant physical and psychological manifestations of stress. The findings of the present study suggest that behavioral problems and potential emotional problems can be risk factors to bruxism in children."
6,Clinical signs of temporomandibular disorders and various pain conditions among children 6 to 8 years of age: the PANIC study.,"To examine the prevalence and significance of clinically determined signs of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and pain in different parts of the body as well as the frequency, intensity, and other features of pain in children.The subjects were a population-based sample of children 6 to 8 years of age. Complete data on clinical signs of TMD were available for 483 children. Data on pain during the past 3 months, assessed by a questionnaire administered by parents, were available for 424 children. Differences between the prevalence of at least one sign of TMD and the location or frequency of pain were evaluated using the chi-square test, as well as the associations between the prevalence, frequency, and location of pain and gender, the use of medication, and visits to a physician. The relationship of various pain conditions with the risk of having clinical signs of TMD was analyzed using logistic regression.Of the 483 children, 171 (35%) had at least one clinical sign of TMD. Of the 424 children, 226 (53%) had experienced pain during the past 3 months. Pain was most prevalent in the lower limbs (35%) and head (32%). Of the 226 children with pain, 119 (53%) had experienced frequent pain (??? once a week). No gender differences were found. The risk of having at least one clinical sign of TMD was 3.0 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.1-8.5, P < .05) times higher in children with back pain, 2.7 (95% CI: 1.2-6.0, P < .05) times higher in children with neck-shoulder pain, and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.5, P < .05) times higher in children with headache compared to children without these pain symptoms. The risk of having at least one clinical sign of TMD was 12.2 (95% CI: 1.4-101.8, P < .01) times higher among children with palpation tenderness in trapezius muscles than among those without it.Clinical signs of TMD and pain symptoms are common in children. The relationship of back pain, neck-shoulder muscle palpation tenderness, and headache with clinical signs of TMD suggests that more attention should be paid to stomatognathic function in children with such pain problems."
6,Changes in masticatory muscles activity associated with Eagle's syndrome.,"This study had the goal of analyzing masseter and temporalis muscles of individuals with Eagle's Syndrome, establishing comparisons with healthy control individuals by means of electromyography, due to the importance of the masticatory musculature upon the various functions of the stomatognathic system and the effects of Eagle's syndrome on this system's functioning.Ten women with Eagle's syndrome and ten healthy controls volunteered to participate in the study. A Myosystem I system, Prosecon Ltda (Uberl??ndia/MG, Brazil) with 12 channels was used Active differential electrodes were placed on the belly of both masseters and on the anterior temporalis. Firstly, rest position was registered and then the patients were instructed to clench their teeth with maximum strength for four seconds to register the Clenching at Usual Maximum Intercuspation. Next, the clinical conditions of chewing, mandible laterality, and water swallowing were performed.The normalized data of muscle activity during the different clinical conditions and at rest position were compared by Student's t test, considering two groups: controls and syndrome bearers. The masticatory muscles of every syndrome bearers showed hyperactivity during the analyzed clinical conditions; except for chewing, in which the right masseter did not show greater electromyographic activity.It is concluded that individuals with the syndrome showed muscular hyperactivity when compared to healthy individuals, due to the interference of the elongated styloid process, which leads to dysfunctions of the stomatognathic system in the syndrome bearers, with signs and symptoms related to craniofacial pain, dysphagia, otalgy, temporomandibular dysfunctions, and headache."
6,Oral surgery II: Part 2. The maxillary sinus (antrum) and oral surgery.,"The maxillary sinus is the largest of the four paranasal sinuses and, being anatomically adjacent to the dentate region of the maxilla, is commonly a source of problems - not simply in terms of conditions affecting the sinus but also in establishing an accurate diagnosis. As anyone who has suffered both sinusitis and a dental abscess in the posterior maxilla will tell you, the symptoms are almost indistinguishable. For this reason, a sound understanding of the maxillary sinus is an essential requisite for all dentists."
6,American Academy of Periodontology Best Evidence Consensus Statement on Selected Oral Applications for Cone-Beam Computed Tomography.,"The American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) recently embarked on a Best Evidence Consensus (BEC) model of scientific inquiry to address questions of clinical importance in periodontology for which there is insufficient evidence to arrive at a definitive conclusion. This review addresses oral indications for use of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).To develop the BEC, the AAP convened a panel of experts with knowledge of CBCT and substantial experience in applying CBCT to a broad range of clinical scenarios that involve critical structures in the oral cavity. The panel examined a clinical scenario or treatment decision that would likely benefit from additional evidence and interpretation of evidence, performed a systematic review on the individual, debated the merits of published data and experiential information, developed a consensus report, and provided a clinical bottom line based on the best evidence available.This BEC addressed the potential value and limitations of CBCT relative to specific applications in the management of patients requiring or being considered for the following clinical therapies: 1) placement of dental implants; 2) interdisciplinary dentofacial therapy involving orthodontic tooth movement in the management of malocclusion with associated risk on the supporting periodontal tissues (namely, dentoalveolar bone); and 3) management of periodontitis.For each specific question addressed, there is a critical mass of evidence, but insufficient evidence to support broad conclusions or definitive clinical practice guidelines."
6,Comparison of intubation and tracheotomy in patients with deep neck infection.,"Possible airway compromise further complicates treatment of deep neck infections (DNI). Airway management is crucial, but factors affecting the method of choice are unclear. We retrospectively evaluated adult DNIs in a single tertiary center covering 10??years, with special attention on airway management. Patient data were retrieved from electronic data files from 2007 to 2016, and included adult patients with DNI operated through the neck. Of the 202 patients, 127 (63%) were male, with a median age of 47??years. Odontogenic (n??=??74; 35%) infection was the most common etiology. Intubation was the most common method of airway management (n??=??165; 82%), and most patients (n??=??102; 50%) were extubated immediately after surgery. Tracheotomy was performed primarily for 35 (17%) patients, and secondarily for 25 (15%). Two patients were managed in local anesthesia. Altogether 80 (40%) patients required care in the intensive care unit for a median of 7??days. Median hospital stay was 6??days for intubated patients and 10??days for primarily tracheotomized (p??=??0.036). DNI extended to the mediastinal space in 25 (12%) patients, most of whom with odontogenic infection (48%), and necrotizing fasciitis (32%). Odontogenic infection was the most common etiology for DNI with increased risk for mediastinal involvement. Intubation was most common type of airway management with high success in immediate extubation after surgery. The need for tracheotomy seemed to lead to a longer hospital care and was associated with a more severe clinical course."
6,"Importance of chewing, saliva, and swallowing function in patients with advanced oral cancer undergoing preoperative chemoradiotherapy: a prospective study of quality of life.","The primary objective of this study was to investigate the quality of life (QOL) of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) undergoing curative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by radical tumour resection and simultaneous oral cavity reconstruction, using two validated questionnaires. A secondary objective was to assess clinical variables predicting post-treatment dysfunction in chewing, saliva, and swallowing. Thirty-five patients with locally advanced OSCC who underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy were recruited prospectively. All patients completed both the University of Washington Quality of Life version 4 questionnaire (UW-QOL) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head & Neck version 4 questionnaire (FACT-H&N). UW-QOL and FACT-H&N items were associated with clinical variables. Nearly three-quarters of OSCC patients perceived good to excellent levels of overall QOL after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Chewing difficulties, decreased salivary function, and swallowing dysfunction were the most frequent complaints of OSCC patients. Items related to food intake were significantly worse in OSCC patients older than 60 years and those with T4 tumours, as well as those without alcohol intake. Chewing, saliva, and swallowing are the most significant issues in patients with OSCC undergoing preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The results of this study may help guide treatment decisions for OSCC patients based on more accurate expectations of adverse effects of cancer treatment."
6,Assessment and Management of Lumps on the Face: a Guide for the General Dental Practitioner.,"There are a number of conditions that can present as a lump on the face. The general dental practitioner is uniquely trained in head and neck anatomy and pathology and should be able to identify these important conditions and consider appropriate investigations. Understanding what requires urgent specialist assessment and what can be referred routinely can be difficult, but is crucial to high quality patient outcomes. This article aims to simplify common conditions that may present as a lump on the face or be an incidental finding within the primary dental care setting. It is by no means an exhaustive description of all the pathology that may be encountered within this anatomical region, however it should form a useful and practical framework for common presentations."
6,"Oral-health-related quality of life of dental patients: a hospital based study in far north Queensland, Australia.","To investigate the prevalence, extent, and severity of oral-health-related quality of life among dental patients in far north Queensland, Australia.A questionnaire was designed consisting of two parts: socio-demographic questions and the short form of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) in part 1 and 2 respectively. The survey was conducted from July to August 2014 among patients attending the James Cook University Dental Clinic.Five hundred and nineteen questionnaires were distributed and collected. Of these, 40 were excluded from the analysis due to being incomplete. Therefore, a total of 479 questionnaires were available for the analysis. Half the respondents (50.9%) reported one or more of the 14 impacts as ""fairly often"" or ""very often."" The individual OHIP items with the highest prevalence recorded were physical pain and psychological discomfort. Females (52.2%) experienced a slightly higher prevalence compared to males (49.3%) but this difference was not statistically significant (Chi-square test: P??>??0.05). Participants who identified as Indigenous Australian or Torres Strait Islanders and those in the 36-50 age group recorded the highest prevalence (Kruskal-Wallis test: P??<??0.05). Indigenous Australians and Torres Strait Islanders also reported the highest mean extent score (4.39) and mean severity score (23.19).This study revealed comparatively higher prevalence, extent, and severity scores reflecting a significantly poor oral-health-related quality of life among dental patients living in far north Queensland, Australia."
6,Impact of rehabilitation with metal-ceramic restorations on oral health-related quality of life.,"Dental ceramics present excellent ability to reproduce the natural teeth regarding esthetic and biomechanics. Recently, due to the advancement of ceramic technology, metal-free restorations were developed. However, the traditional metal-ceramic restorations still present the requirements of high strength, long survival in the oral environment and favorable aesthetics. In this context, it is essential to know the specificity of each ceramic system available in order to apply it properly to various clinical situations. This report describes an integrated rehabilitation using metal-ceramic restorations of a patient at 50 years of age, who presented edentulous spaces, and previous unsatisfactory composite and amalgam restorations, and indirect metallic restorations, leading to compromised quality of life in both functional and psychosocial aspects. The impact on quality of life was measured using a generic instrument, OHIP-14, validated for the World Health Organization, which covers both the biological and the psychosocial dimensions. This instrument was applied to the patient before and after treatment. The patient had an overall OHIP-14 score of 28 before the treatment and after treatment the score decreased to 0, showing that dental and oral health conditions are factors that do impact on the quality of life. Rehabilitation has provided functional and aesthetic restorations, harmony of the stomatognathic system and improvement of life quality."
6,Evaluation of the Effect of Plasma Rich in Growth Factors (PRGF) on Bone Regeneration.,"Reconstruction methods are an essential prerequisite for functional rehabilitation of the stomatognathic system. Plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) offers a new and potentially useful adjunct to bone substitute materials in bone reconstructive surgery. This study was carried out to investigate the influence of PRGF and fibrin membrane on regeneration of bony defects with and without deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) on rabbit calvaria.Twelve New Zealand white rabbits were included in this randomized, blinded, prospective study. Four equal 3.3??6.6 mm cranial bone defects were created and immediately grafted with DBBM, PRGF+DBBM, PRGF+fibrin membrane and no treatment as control. The defects were evaluated with histologic and histomorphometric analysis performed 4 and 8 weeks later.Adding PRGF to DBBM led to increased bone formation as compared with the control group in 4- and 8-week intervals. In DBBM and PRGF+fibrin membrane samples, no significant increase was seen compared to the control group. There was also a significant increase in the rate of biodegradation of DBBM particles with the addition of PRGF in the 8-week interval. Neither noticeable foreign body reaction nor any severe inflammation was seen in each of the specimens evaluated.Under the limitation of this study, adding PRGF to DBBM enhanced osteogenesis in rabbit calvarias. Applying autologous fibrin membrane in the defects was not helpful."
6,Reestablishment of occlusion through overlay removable partial dentures: a case report.,"Loss of posterior teeth may cause an imbalance in the stomatognathic system. Overlay removable partial dentures (ORPD) are a reversible and relatively inexpensive treatment for patients with severely worn teeth. This paper presents a treatment with ORPD in a 55-year-old male patient who had severe attrition in the maxillary and mandibular teeth, temporomandibular joint pain and reduced vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO). The treatment consisted in the reestablishment of the VDO using Lucia's jig, fabricating removable partial denture with reconstruction of the worn teeth without preparation. This therapy can be used as an alternative treatment to provide esthetic, function and stable occlusion in patients with severely worn teeth."
6,Functional impairment in submandibular gland of rats induced by 5-fluorouracil and calcium leucovorin.,"One of the main clinical problems during chemotherapy is the occurrence of severe systemic toxicities, including those related to the stomatognathic system, which contribute to reducing the patient's quality of life. The most frequent oral complications are mucositis, dysgeusia, inflammation, gingival bleeding and decreased salivary flow or hyposalivation, a factor that predisposes to xerostomia, and other local complications that alter the homeostasis of the system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional activity of salivary glands in Wistar rats subject to chemotherapy by measuring salivary flow, glycogen levels and glandular tissue response to autonomic nervous system agonists. Five experimental groups were used: 1) Control group fed ""ad libitum""; 2) 5-fluorouracil (20 mg/kg body weight); 3) Calcium leucovorin (10 mg/kg body weight); 4) 5-fluorouracil + calcium leucovorin (20 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) by intraperitoneal injection for five consecutive days and 5) control with paired diet. Groups 1 and 5 did not receive drugs. Treatment with fluorouracil + leucovorin produced an increase in stimulated salivary flow and a higher response to increasing doses of beta agonists compared to other experimental groups. In both groups treated with cytostatic drugs, blocking of glycogen consumption at the end of the experimental period was observed. Our work suggests that salivary secretion may be affected by a dual mechanism: the first would be toxicity induced by 5-FU, which would cause depression of the process of glucose utilization. The second mechanism would affect the sympathetic autonomic reflex arc. In this instance, the synergistic action of 5-FU + LV would have a negative effect on the nerve activity with a reduction of salivary secretion. This would explain the hyposalivation, cited by several authors in patients undergoing the 5-FU + LV scheme in the treatment of colon carcinoma."
6,[Study of stomatological status in patients of dental implantological clinic according to the data of orthopantomography and computer tomography].,"During examination before dental implantation with the use of orthopantomography (OPTG) and computer tomography (CT) stomatological status was studied in 242 patients of the Clinical stomatologic centre of FMBA, Russia. Indices of frequency and intensity of dental caries and periodontal disease were determined, as well as frequency of maxillary sinuses pathology, evaluation of the preliminary endodontic treatment quality was given, morphometric data governing frequency of indications to bone-plastic operations were presented. The advantages of CT over OPTG were shown during patients examination before dental implantations were maid."
6,Born Into Addiction: Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome and Pediatric Dentistry.,"Drug overdose and opioid-involved deaths continue to increase across the United States. An end-condition related to opioid abuse is neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The implications for pregnant or post-partum women using an opioid, whether prescribed or illicit, can have significant effects on their infant. First described in the 1970s, NAS is defined as a postnatal drug withdrawal syndrome that primarily occurs in opioid-exposed infants. There are no nationally accepted, evidence-based treatment protocols for these infants. Pediatric dentists should be cognizant of potential dental development issues and developmental delays in children with NAS. Basic behavior guidance techniques, such as tell-show-do, may not be as effective. In addition, adherence to prescription drug monitoring programs can help identify patients who may have received multiple opioids, alerting the provider to possible misuse or abuse. The purpose of this paper was to provide background information on the incidences and potential dental implications for children with neonatal abstinence syndrome."
6,Cohort profile: the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) in Korea.,"The National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) is a cohort of participants who participated in health screening programmes provided by the NHIS in the Republic of Korea. The NHIS constructed the NHIS-HEALS cohort database in 2015. The purpose of this cohort is to offer relevant and useful data for health researchers, especially in the field of non-communicable diseases and health risk factors, and policy-maker.To construct the NHIS-HEALS database, a sample cohort was first selected from the 2002 and 2003 health screening participants, who were aged between 40 and 79 in 2002 and followed up through 2013. This cohort included 514?€?866 health screening participants who comprised a random selection of 10% of all health screening participants in 2002 and 2003.The age-standardised prevalence of anaemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolaemia and abnormal urine protein were 9.8%, 8.2%, 35.6%, 2.7%, 14.2% and 2.0%, respectively. The age-standardised mortality rate for the first 2 years (through 2004) was 442.0 per 100?€?000 person-years, while the rate for 10 years (through 2012) was 865.9 per 100?€?000 person-years. The most common cause of death was malignant neoplasm in both sexes (364.1 per 100?€?000 person-years for men, 128.3 per 100?€?000 person-years for women).This database can be used to study the risk factors of non-communicable diseases and dental health problems, which are important health issues that have not yet been fully investigated. The cohort will be maintained and continuously updated by the NHIS."
6,Pediatric ambulatory care sensitive conditions: Birth cohorts and the socio-economic gradient.,"This study examines the socio-economic gradient in utilization and the risk factors associated with hospitalization for four pediatric ambulatory care sensitive conditions (dental conditions, asthma, gastroenteritis, and bacterial pneumonia). Dental conditions, where much care is provided by dentists and insurance coverage varies among different population segments, present special issues.A population registry, provider registry, physician ambulatory claims, and hospital discharge abstracts from 28 398 children born in 2003-2006 in urban centres in Manitoba, Canada were the main data sources. Physician visits and hospitalizations were compared across neighbourhood income groupings using rank correlations and logistic regressions.Very strong relationships between neighbourhood income and utilization were highlighted. Additional variables - family on income assistance, mother's age at first birth, breastfeeding - helped predict the probability of hospitalization. Despite the complete insurance coverage (including visits to dentists and physicians and for hospitalizations) provided, receiving income assistance was associated with higher probabilities of hospitalization.We found a socio-economic gradient in utilization for pediatric ambulatory care sensitive conditions, with higher rates of ambulatory visits and hospitalizations in the poorest neighbourhoods. Insurance coverage which varies between different segments of the population complicates matters. Providing funding for dental care for Manitobans on income assistance has not prevented physician visits or intensive treatment in high-cost facilities, specifically treatment under general anesthesia. When services from one type of provider (dentist) are not universally insured but those from another type (physician) are, using rates of hospitalization to indicate problems in the organization of care seems particularly difficult."
6,Trends in emergency department visits for non-traumatic dental conditions in Ontario from 2006 to 2014.,"In Canada, non-traumatic dental conditions (NTDCs) presenting in emergency departments (EDs) are dealt with by non-dental professionals who are generally not equipped to deal with such emergencies, resulting in an inefficient usage of heath care resources. This study aimed to assess the burden of ED visits for NTDCs in Ontario by observing trends from 2006 to 2014.Aggregate data for Ontario were obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information's National Ambulatory Care Reporting System. Data were examined for the whole of Ontario and stratified by 14 Local Health Integration Networks. Descriptive analysis was conducted for both number of people and number of visits, stratified by sex and age groups (0-5, 6-18, 19-64, and 65+ years). Numbers were also examined by neighbourhood stratifications, including urban/rural, income quintile and immigrant tercile.Over the study period, an upward trend of visiting EDs for NTDCs was observed. Approximately 403 628 people in Ontario made 482 565 visits over the period of nine years. On average, 341 per 100 000 people, per year, visited. Young children, people living in neighbourhoods with lower income and higher immigrant concentration, and people living in the rural regions, visited EDs more for NTDCs during 2006-2014.The upward and inequitable trends of utilization of EDs for NTDCs reinforce recognition of the important need for both universal and targeted approaches for primary prevention of dental conditions. To enhance equitable access to dental care, policy advocacy is required for publicly funding essential and emergency dental services for all."
6,Interindividual differences in embodied marginalization: Osteological and stable isotope analyses of antebellum enslaved individuals.,"Through pathological and stable isotope analyses, this study probes the stressors, disease ecology, and diets of enslaved individuals from an antebellum plantation cemetery. The study aims to highlight how interindividual isotopic differences reveal that marginalization is not uniformly experienced or embodied.The cemetery population consists of 16 individuals; dental and skeletal pathological indicators were collected for all individuals, and light stable isotope ratios (??<sup>15</sup> N, ??<sup>13</sup> C) were generated from the collagen and hydroxyapatite of nine individuals.The analyzed individuals have high frequencies of enamel defects-similar to contemporaneous enslaved cemetery individuals-and particularly high frequencies of carious lesions. Skeletal analysis shows evidence of chronic conditions among several individuals, two of whom likely have tuberculosis. Although the sample size is small, stable isotope values display interesting trends: there is interindividual heterogeneity in ??<sup>13</sup> C values, and most subadults from the cemetery have lower ??<sup>15</sup> N and higher ??<sup>13</sup> C values than the sampled adults. These relationships can be tested with larger datasets and have the potential to reveal important information about slave foodways and the broader experience of enslavement.The results of this study suggest that racial discrimination, enslavement, and age do not fully account for the heterogeneity in degree of embodied stressors. There are likely other factors at play, intersecting with the aforementioned, that influenced the lived experience of slavery and the degree of marginalization."
6,Functional outcomes after free flap reconstruction of the upper aerodigestive tract.,"When the complex structures of the upper aerodigestive tract are disrupted after resection of head and neck tumors, an appropriate reconstructive option should be chosen in an attempt to regain maximum function. Reconstructions using microvascular free tissue transfer offer unparalleled flexibility, both in tissue composition and in placement. This article will examine functional outcomes after free flap reconstruction of the upper aerodigestive tract.With the maturation of free tissue transfer techniques, functional outcomes are being analyzed with increasing frequency. Recent reports show promising results for free flap reconstruction of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal soft tissue defects, as well as for bony mandibular and maxillary defects.For both soft tissue and bony defects of the upper aerodigestive tract, microvascular free flaps provide good functional outcomes. In the future, randomized studies are needed to compare the functional outcomes of microvascular free flaps with those of other reconstructive options."
6,Prevalence of hyperopia and strabismus in a paediatric population with malocclusions.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hyperopia and strabismus among a paediatric  population with malocclusions.From a total of 322 consecutive patients observed at the  department of Orthodontics and Gnathology, Dental Clinic, University of L'Aquila, 176 were selected for the study according  to the exclusion criteria. Pretreatment diagnostic data, which included radiographic, cephalometric and dental cast  evaluation, were recorded and presence of hyperopia or strabismus was assessed through an ophthalmological  examination. Differences in incidence rates of strabismus or hyperopia by sex and malocclusion were analysed by using the  chi-square (Pearson's chi-square test) and Fisher's exact tests.According to the sagittal malocclusion, patients  were classified as Class I (122), Class II division 1 (26), Class II Division 2 (9), or Class III (19); after ophthalmological  examination, hyperopia was detected in 8.6% of patients, while strabismus was present in 3.6% of them.  No  gender influence was found for hyperopia, strabismus or malocclusion.Few studies investigated a possible  relationship between the ocular and stomatognathic system, and no data are available in the scientific literature; the present  study did not highlight differences in the prevalence of hyperopia or strabismus in the three Angle classes malocclusion.The findings of the present study did not suggest a possible association between hyperopia or strabismus  and sagittal malocclusion, but future studies are needed to confirm and explain this observation."
6,Assessment of Neck Lumps in Relation to Dentistry.,"Neck lumps have a varied aetiology, from a benign inflammatory cause to the first presenting sign of a malignancy. Patients may present to primary care complaining of a neck lump or they may be identified as an incidental finding during routine examination. This article highlights a structured approach to the initial assessment including history taking, risk factor assessment and clinical examination. Further investigations undertaken in a secondary care setting, such as ultrasound and guided fine needle aspirations, are then discussed. The common congenital, inflammatory, infective, vascular and neoplastic causes of neck lumps and their management and specialist referral pathway are discussed."
6,Schedule for Rating Disabilities; Dental and Oral Conditions. Final rule.,This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Schedule for Rating Disabilities by revising the portion of the schedule that addresses dental and oral conditions. The effect of this action is to ensure that the rating schedule uses current medical terminology and to provide detailed and updated criteria for evaluation of dental and oral conditions for disability rating purposes.
6,Symptoms in the masticatory system and related quality of life in prospective orthognathic patients.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between orthognathic patients' self-reported symptoms in the head and neck region and their quality of life (QoL).Participants included were consecutive patients (n?€?=?€?50) referred to the assessment of orthognathic treatment need and voluntary first-year university students (n?€?=?€?29). All participants filled in the Orthognathic Quality of Life Questionnaire (OQLQ) and a structured diary created by the authors. The median values of Orthognathic Quality of Life (OQOL) sum and subscores, satisfaction with oral function and number of awakenings were compared between patients and controls. Further, correlations between the OQOL sum and subscores, satisfaction with oral function and number of awakenings were analyzed.Patients reported significantly more symptoms (p?€?=?€?.013) and woke up significantly more often than the controls (p?€?=?€?.032). Their OQOL sum scores were significantly higher (indicating a lower OQOL) (p?€?=?€?.001), and they were significantly less satisfied with their oral function than the controls (p?€?<?€?.001). Among the awakened and not-rested patients, the most commonly reported symptoms were pain in the head and/or neck region and fatigue and/or stiffness in the jaws.Experiences of pain and discomfort have a significant impact on patients' OQOL and well-being."
6,[Investigation of stomatologic status of middle-aged and elderly people in Western Georgia].,"The world's population is aging at an accelerated rate. People aged 65 and over now comprise a greater share of the world's population than ever before, and this proportion will increase during the 21st century. Increased lifetime in old age is combined with a concern about its quality. Oral health care of the elderly is one of the important aspects affecting the quality of life. The aim of the present study was to describe stomatologic status among middle-aged and elderly people in western Georgia. 355 subjects aged 55-90 years old were surveyed. According to oral health survey data, a high prevalence and intensity of dental caries and periodontal disease were apparent. Prosthetic status and treatment need were recorded in standard condition using oral health assessment forms. It is concluded that a high percentage of elderly were dentate but the average number of teeth was low and their status was poor, with very high need for therapeutic and prosthetic treatment."
6,The morphology of the masticatory apparatus facilitates muscle force production at wide jaw gapes in tree-gouging common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).,"Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) generate wide jaw gapes when gouging trees with their anterior teeth to elicit tree exudate flow. Closely related cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) do not gouge trees but share similar diets including exudates. Maximizing jaw opening theoretically compromises the bite forces that marmosets can generate during gouging. To investigate how jaw-muscle architecture and craniofacial position impact muscle performance during gouging, we combine skull and jaw-muscle architectural features to model muscle force production across a range of jaw gapes in these two species. We incorporate joint mechanics, resting sarcomere length and muscle architecture estimates from the masseter and temporalis to model muscle excursion, sarcomere length and relative tension as a function of joint angle. Muscle excursion from occlusion to an estimated maximum functional gape of 55 deg. was smaller in all regions of the masseter and temporalis of C. jacchus compared with S. oedipus except the posterior temporalis. As a consequence of reduced muscle excursion distributed over more sarcomeres in series (i.e. longer fibers), sarcomere length operating ranges are smaller in C. jacchus jaw muscles across this range of gapes. This configuration allows C. jacchus to act on a more favorable portion of the length-tension curve at larger gapes and thereby generate relatively greater tension in these muscles compared with S. oedipus. Our results suggest that biting performance during tree gouging in common marmosets is improved by a musculoskeletal configuration that reduces muscle stretch at wide gapes while simultaneously facilitating comparatively large muscle forces at the extremes of jaw opening."
6,Day surgery visits for dental problems.,"To fill an information gap for dental care policy stakeholders in Canada, this pilot study explored the nature of day surgery (DS) visits for dental problems in Ontario, the country's largest province.The Canadian Institute for Health Information's National Ambulatory Care Reporting System was used, which contains demographic, diagnostic, procedural and administrative information for ambulatory care settings across Ontario. Fiscal years 2003/2004 to 2005/2006 data were included for DS visits that had a main problem coded with an International Classification of Diseases code in the range K00-K14, representing diseases of the oral cavity, salivary glands and jaws.During this period, approximately 75 791 persons made 79 133 DS visits for dental problems in Ontario. Proportionally, children under 5 years of age with dental caries represent the majority of DS visits. Restorations and extractions were the most frequently performed DS care procedure.This is the first study of its kind in Canada, and confirms many of the assumptions held about DS care for dental problems. The study also acts as a baseline for ongoing quality improvement and planning within the province of Ontario."
6,Multimedia patient education to assist oral impression taking during dental treatment: A pilot study.,"Proper cooperation between patient and dentist is of great help to make a good oral impression. However, patients are frequently confused when information is given through traditional verbal description. The present study compared the effectiveness of the multimedia information delivery ways with the traditional verbal manner on patients' understanding level in oral impression taking.The recruited 191 participating patients were randomly assigned to the control group (the verbal group) and two intervention groups (the video group and the picture group) according to the information delivery manner. After intervention, the patients' understanding degree was measured by questionnaire and performance evaluation of behavior feedback on the provided information quantitatively. Also, patients' self-assessment of satisfaction was interviewed by telephone. All data was analyzed by SPSS 14.0 software, and p???0.05 was set as significant difference in advance.One-Way ANOVA and Chi-square showed there were no statistically significant differences in the mean age, gender composition, and educational level among the three groups (P>0.05). In both questionnaire assessment and performance evaluation, One-Way ANOVA followed by LSD indicate that the video group gained a higher score than the verbal group or the picture group (P<0.05). The questionnaire score in the picture group is significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.05), but no significant difference was shown between these two groups in patients' performance evaluation (P>0.05). Higher percentage of satisfaction was reported by patients in the two multimedia groups than that in the control group.Oral impression taking is a consecutive process that requires action cooperation between dentists and patients simultaneously. This particularity makes it more suitable for multimedia delivery. The delivery of tailored information using multimedia in this study was favored by most patients and could improve the degree of patient understanding of the oral impression taking procedures."
6,Mechanisms underlying methamphetamine-related dental disease.,"The authors clarified the causal mechanisms underlying the high prevalence of dental disease encountered in people who habitually use methamphetamine (meth).Using a stratified sampling approach, the authors conducted comprehensive oral examinations and psychosocial assessments for 571 study participants who used meth. Three calibrated dentists, who used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) protocols, characterized the study participants' dental disease. The authors also collected data related to study participants' history of meth use and other attributes linked to dental disease.Study participants who used meth manifested higher rates of xerostomia and caries experience compared with NHANES control participants. Participants who used meth had a higher level of daily consumption of sugary beverages compared with NHANES control participants. Smoking meth did not increase caries experience over other modes of intake. Dental hygiene was a significant determinant of dental health outcomes.Mode of intake and frequency of meth use??have a minimal impact on dental health outcomes. Behaviors, such as sugary beverage consumption and poor oral hygiene, better explain dental health outcomes.Having a better understanding of the causal mechanisms of ""meth mouth"" sets the stage for clinicians to provide more personalized interventions and management of dental disease in people who use meth."
6,Development of a database to record orofacial manifestations in patients with rare diseases: a status report from the ROMSE (recording of orofacial manifestations in people with rare diseases) database.,"The aim of this working group was to establish a ROMSE (recording of orofacial manifestations in people with rare diseases) database to provide clinicians, patients, and their families with better information about these diseases. In 2011, we began to search the databases Orphanet, OMIM<sup>??</sup> (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man<sup>??</sup>), and PubMed, for rare diseases with orofacial symptoms, and since 2013, the collected information has been incorporated into a web-based, freely accessible database. To date, 471 rare diseases with orofacial signs have been listed on ROMSE, and 10 main categories with 99 subcategories of signs such as different types of dental anomalies, changes in the oral mucosa, dysgnathia, and orofacial clefts, have been defined. The database provides a platform for general clinicians, orthodontists, and oral and maxillofacial surgeons to work on the best treatments."
6,Bruxism: overview of current knowledge and suggestions for dental implants planning.,"Bruxism is commonly considered a detrimental motor activity, potentially causing overload of the stomatognathic structures and representing a risk factor for dental implant survival. The available literature does not provide evidence-based guidelines for the management of bruxers undergoing implant-retained restorations. The present paper reviewed current concepts on bruxism etiology, diagnosis and management, underlining its effects on dental implants in an attempt to provide clinically useful suggestions based on scientifically sound data. Unfortunately, very little data exists on the subject of a cause-and-effect relationship between bruxism and implant failure, to the point that expert opinions and cautionary approaches are still considered the best available sources for suggesting good practice indicators. By including experimental literature data on the effects of different types of occlusal loading on peri-implant marginal bone loss along with data from studies investigating the intensity of the forces transmitted to the bone itself during tooth-clenching and tooth-grinding activities, the authors were able to compile the suggestions presented here for prosthetic implant rehabilitations in patients with bruxism."
6,Computational and clinical investigation on the role of mechanical vibration on orthodontic tooth movement.,"The aim of this study is to investigate the biomechanics for orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) subjected to concurrent single-tooth vibration (50Hz) with conventional orthodontic force application, via a clinical study and computational simulation. Thirteen patients were recruited in the clinical study, which involved distal retraction of maxillary canines with 1.5N (150g) force for 12weeks. In a split mouth study, vibration and non-vibration sides were randomly assigned to each subject. Vibration of 50Hz, of approximately 0.2N (20g) of magnitude, was applied on the buccal surface of maxillary canine for the vibration group. A mode-based steady-state dynamic finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted based on an anatomically detailed model, complying with the clinical protocol. Both the amounts of space closure and canine distalization of the vibration group were significantly higher than those of the control group, as measured intra-orally or on models (p<0.05). Therefore it is indicated that a 50Hz and 20g single-tooth vibration can accelerate maxillary canine retraction. The volume-average hydrostatic stress (VHS) in the periodontal ligament (PDL) was computationally calculated to be higher with vibration compared with the control group for maxillary teeth and for both linguo-buccal and mesial-distal directions. An increase in vibratory frequency further amplified the PDL response before reaching a local natural frequency. An amplification of PDL response was also shown to be induced by vibration based on computational simulation. The vibration-enhanced OTM can be described by mild, vigorous and diminishing zones among which the mild zone is considered to be clinically beneficial."
6,Oral Health Interventions During Pregnancy.,"Oral health is a fundamental component of health and physical and mental well-being. Oral health is influenced by an individual's physiologic and psychosocial attributes and cumulative oral health experiences. The perinatal period is a critical time when health and oral health determinants set in and thus an important time for intervention. Recognition of the importance of oral health intervention during pregnancy and oral health infrastructures have substantially grown over the last several years. This article reviews the current state of knowledge and practice of oral health intervention during pregnancy with a focus on individual- and population-based strategies, and summarizes key agendas for advancing prenatal oral health."
6,[Prophylactic requirements for sanitary and epidemiological surveillance in dentistry].,"The paper outlines the requirements for sanitary-and-epidemiological surveillance to prevent dental diseases. The investigations pose tasks to medical prevention centers to solve the problems in tooth prophylaxis, such as organizational-and-methodological, sanitary-and-educational, health-improving, and others. The sanitary-and-hygienic requirements for therapeutic-and-prophylactic dental facilities are defined. A procedure for keeping a management protocol for the prevention of tooth diseases is described."
6,Differential activation of projection neurons by two sensory pathways contributes to motor pattern selection.,"Sensorimotor integration is known to occur at the level of motor circuits as well as in upstream interneurons that regulate motor activity. Here we show, using the crab stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) as a model, that different sensory systems affect the same set of projection neurons. However, they have qualitatively different effects on their activities (excitation vs. inhibition), and these differences contribute to the selection of motor patterns from multifunctional circuits. We compare the actions of the proprioceptive anterior gastric receptor (AGR) and the inferior ventricular (IV) neurons, which relay chemosensory information from the brain to the STNS, on modulatory commissural neurons 1 and 5 (MCN1 and MCN5) and commissural projection neuron 2 (CPN2) and their resulting actions on the gastric mill central pattern generating circuit in the stomatogastric ganglion. When stimulated, AGR and the IV neurons affect all three projection neurons but elicit distinct gastric mill rhythms. The effects of both sensory pathways on the projection neurons differ in the type of excitation provided to CPN2 and MCN5 (electrical vs. chemical) and the effect on MCN1 (direct inhibition by AGR vs. polysynaptic excitation by the IV neurons). The latter is functionally important because a restoration of MCN1 activity during the AGR rhythm made it more similar to that elicited by IV neuron stimulation. Our results thus support the hypothesis that sensory pathways activate different combinations of projection neurons to select distinct outputs from the same neuronal circuit."
6,"Jaw mechanics in basal ceratopsia (Ornithischia, Dinosauria).","Ceratopsian dinosaurs were a dominant group of herbivores in Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems. We hypothesize that an understanding of the feeding system will provide important insight into the evolutionary success of these animals. The mandibular mechanics of eight genera of basal ceratopsians was examined to understand the variability in shape of the jaws and the early evolution of the masticatory system in Ceratopsia. Data were collected on lever arms, cranial angles and tooth row lengths. The results indicate that psittacosaurids had higher leverage at the beak and in the rostral part of the tooth row than basal neoceratopsians, but lower leverage in the caudal part of the tooth row. Although the vertebrate mandible is generally considered as a third-class lever, that of basal neoceratopsians acted as a second-class lever at the caudal part of the tooth row, as is also true in ceratopsids. When total input force from the mandibular adductor muscles on both sides of the skull is considered, the largest bite force in basal ceratopsian tooth rows was exerted in the caudal part of the tooth row at the caudal extremity of the zone with near-maximum input force. Medially positioned teeth generate higher leverage than laterally positioned teeth. The largest bite force in all basal ceratopsians is smaller than the maximum input force, a limit imposed by the morphology of the basal ceratopsian masticatory system. In ceratopsids, caudal extension of the tooth row resulted in a much larger bite force, even exceeding the maximum input force."
6,"Association between patient age, geographical location, Indigenous status and hospitalisation for oral and dental conditions in Queensland, Australia.","A retrospective analysis of hospitalisation due to oral and dental conditions (ODC) was performed for patients in Queensland. The aim was to identify the rate and cost of hospitalisation and to examine the association between hospitalisation and age, geographical location and Indigenous status. There were 81528 admissions to Queensland's hospitals due to ODC during the 3-year study period (2011-2013). The annual cost of ODC-related hospitalisation was estimated to be AU$87million. Indigenous infants (Z=4.08, P<0.001) and primary school children (Z=2.01, P=0.046) were significantly more likely to be hospitalised than their non-Indigenous counterparts. A non-Indigenous high school child was almost fourfold more likely to be hospitalised. There was no significant difference in the rate of hospitalisation for adults. Infants (Z=6.70, P<0.001) and primary school children (Z=8.73, P<0.001) from remote areas were significantly more likely to be hospitalised than their age-matched metropolitan counterparts. Whereas high school children (Z=2.74, P=0.006) and adults (Z=6.02, P<0.001) from remote areas were significantly less likely to be hospitalised. Our findings suggest that there is a need for alternative models of primary dental care to service remote areas of Queensland and Indigenous populations. Strategies that enable Indigenous Health Workers to provide dental care, and the use of teledentistry, are models of care that may reduce potentially preventable hospitalisations and lead to cost savings and better health outcomes."
6,Inflammatory involvement of the temporomandibular joint. Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects and a study of individuals with ankylosing spondylitis.,"The aims of this thesis were firstly to investigate the relationship between pain and tenderness to palpation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), radiographic changes of the joint and signs of inflammation in the synovial fluid and to compare the effects of intra-articular injections of a corticosteroid into the TMJ with occlusal treatment in patients with tenderness to palpation of the TMJ, secondly to study subjective, clinical and radiographic features in the stomatognathic system of individuals with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in comparison with individuals without general joint symptoms or disease, and thirdly to study the observer variability of some variables used in the clinical examination of the stomatognathic system. Radiographic, cellular and biochemical signs of inflammation were frequently found in the TMJs of patients with longstanding pain and tenderness in this joint. Absence of radiographic changes of the TMJ did not, however, exclude the possibility of organic TMJ disease. Both intra-articular injections of corticosteroid combined with local anaesthetic and occlusal treatment showed a long-term palliative effect on subjective symptoms and clinical signs from the stomatognathic system. The clinical signs, however, showed a significantly better long-term response to the intra-articular injections than to the occlusal treatment. The prognosis for the intra-articular steroid injections was most favourable in patients without radiographic signs of TMJ remodelling or general joint symptoms. The ankylosing spondylitis study showed that subjective and clinical symptoms in the stomatognathic system and radiographic changes of the TMJ are more frequent in the individuals with AS compared to the other individuals. Most signs and symptoms in the stomatognathic system of the individuals with AS were correlated to the extension and severity of this disease. There was also a correlation between clinical and radiographic signs of inflammatory involvement of the TMJ and subjective and clinical symptoms from the stomatognathic system in the individuals with AS which was not found in the other individuals. Occlusal factors seemed to play a minor etiological role in the development of signs and symptoms from the stomatognathic system in both the individuals with AS and the other individuals. The methodological study showed that the intra-observer variability was generally lower than the interobserver variability. Maximal mouth opening capacity had the lowest observer variability in the clinical examination."
6,Adoption of dental innovations: The case of a standardized dental diagnostic terminology.,"Standardized dental diagnostic terminologies (SDDxTs) were introduced decades ago. Their use has been on the rise, accompanying the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs). One of the most broadly used terminologies is the Dental Diagnostic System (DDS). Our aim was to assess the adoption of SDDxTs by US dental schools by using the Rogers diffusion of innovations framework, focusing on the DDS.The authors electronically surveyed clinic deans in all US dental schools (n??= 61) to determine use of an EHR and SDDxT, perceived barriers to adoption of an SDDxT, and the effect of implementing an SDDxT on clinical productivity.The response rate was 57%. Of the 35 responses, 91% reported using an EHR to document patient care, with 84% using axiUm; 41% used the DDS. Fifty-four percent of those who did not use an SDDxT had considered adopting the DDS, but 38% had not, citing barriers such as complexity and compatibility.Adoption of an SDDxT, particularly the DDS, is on the rise. Nevertheless, a large number of institutions are in??the Rogers late majority and laggards categories with respect to adoption. Several factors may discourage adoption, including the inability to try out the terminology on a small scale, poor usability within the EHR, the fact that it would be a cultural shift in practice, and a perception of unclear benefits. However, the consolidation of the DDS and American Dental Association terminology efforts stands to encourage adoption.The successful adoption of dental innovation depends not only on the intrinsic merit of the innovation, as some useful innovations do not achieve widespread traction. As such, it is important for health care providers to understand how to disseminate their ideas in order to ensure traction and widespread adoption."
6,Unique B7-H1 expression on masticatory mucosae in the oral cavity and trans-coinhibition by B7-H1-expressing keratinocytes regulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated mucosal tissue inflammation.,"The PD-1/B7-H1 pathway regulates immune responses and maintains homeostasis. Here, we identified a unique expression of B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1) on masticatory mucosae in the oral cavity. B7-H1 was physiologically expressed on the dorsal surface of the tongue, gingiva, and hard palate. Other squamous epithelia and other structures of the epithelia did not express B7-H1 in the steady state. Physiological B7-H1 expression on masticatory mucosae was limited on prickle cells, and its expression on basal keratinocytes (KCs) was strictly regulated. B7-H1 on prickle cells was upregulated by external topical stimuli, but B7-H1 on basal KCs was induced only by internal stimuli via infiltrating cells. The blocking of KC-associated B7-H1 or the lack of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) on tissue effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice lacking B7-H1 on immune cells drastically exacerbated the tissue inflammation induced by topical OVA painting as an exogenous antigen, indicating direct interaction with KCs and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Trans-coinhibitory signals by KCs may modulate local T-cell/dendritic cell activation, resulting in inhibition of T-cell responses in both peripheral and secondary lymphoid tissues. Careful control of B7-H1 induction in KCs may play a crucial role in the protection from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated tissue inflammation by exogenous antigens delivered from the mucosal surface."
6,Study of the kinematic variables of unilateral and habitual mastication of healthy individuals.,"To describe and compare the temporal-spatial kinematic variables of mandibular movement during deliberate unilateral and habitual mastication in healthy young-adult individuals.The study sample was composed of eight male healthy volunteers aged 19 to 24 years. The kinematic data were obtained using a motion analysis system - Qualisys Track Manager (QTM) ProReflex MCU. Recordings were performed during deliberate unilateral mastication (UM) and habitual mastication (HM) of firm-consistency gummy candy. The following variables were analyzed: (1) masticatory sequence: duration, number of masticatory cycles, and chewing rate; (2) masticatory cycle: duration, vertical and medial-lateral mandibular range of motion in relation to the skull, and maximum velocity during the opening and closing phases. Data of the variables were compared during UM and HM by the paired t test, and the effect sizes ('d' Cohen) were calculated.Regarding the variables of the masticatory sequence, smaller chewing rate was observed for UM compared with that for HM (1.19??0.21Hz and 1.29??0.16Hz, respectively, p=0.004, d=0.53). Smaller values of maximum velocity during the opening (MU=67.4 mm/s and MH=80.02, p=0.053, d=0.80) and closing (MU=71.77??9.35mm/s and MH=3.51??7mm/s, p=0.014, d=0.79) phases of the masticatory cycle were observed in deliberate unilateral mastication compared with those in habitual mastication.Kinematic variables associated with the sequence and cycle of mastication are influenced by the chewing pattern adopted - deliberate unilateral or habitual."
6,Orofacial problems in musicians: a review of the literature.,"The objective of our study was to review the different pathologies of the stomatognathic system that can present in musicians as a result of playing their instruments.The National Library of Medicine's PubMed database was searched to identify all peer-reviewed articles in the English literature dealing with orofacial problems in musicians, using both subject headings such as MeSH terms (PubMed) and free text words in combination (oral, musician, violin, wind instruments, vocalists, orthodontic, tooth, temporomandibular disorders [TMD]). The identified studies were assessed independently by two authors. We included any instruments that involved the orofacial area: i.e., wind and brass instruments, vocalists, and violins and violas.Thirty-two articles were selected that were of many different types (clinical reviews, longitudinal and transverse studies of therapeutic procedures, case-control studies). Among orofacial problems, the most common disorders that affect musicians are TMDs, herpes simplex virus infections, orthodontic problems, and problems with perioral musculature.Musicians may suffer from pathological conditions that are worsened by their occupation due to excessive practice and stress. These conditions can cause permanent injuries that subsequently prevent the musicians from playing. Depending on the characteristics of the musical instrument and the way it is played, professional musicians generally show a propensity for buccodental problems."
6,[Preventive strategies in prosthetic dentistry].,"Despite the success in preventing oral diseases, the prevalence of tooth loss in the German population remains high and increases with age. Today, the advances in prosthetic dentistry allow necessary tooth replacement following preventive strategies-after considering benefits and risks. Modern treatment options improve the overall prognosis of the stomatognathic system and the quality of life of the affected patients significantly. Hereby, adverse iatrogenic effects can be minimized or even completely avoided by extending the traditional treatment spectrum, e.g., using adhesively fixed restorations and implant-supported restorations, and refraining from placing restorations that are unnecessary from the medical point of view. Generally, patients benefit greatly from prosthetic treatment and the achieved health gain is remarkably high. It encompasses not only the recovery of the impaired oral functions but also extends to the whole human organism, including nutrition, digestion, musculoskeletal system, as well as mental and social well-being."
6,Hypoglossal nucleus projections to the rat masseter muscle.,"We investigated in the rat whether hypoglossal innervation extended to facial muscles other than the extrinsic musculature of the mystacial pad. Results showed that hypoglossal neurons also innervate the masseter muscle. Dil injected into the XII nucleus showed hypoglossal axons in the ipsilateral main trunk of the trigeminal nerve. After Gasser's ganglion crossing, the axons entered into the infraorbital division of the trigeminal nerve and targeted the extrinsic muscles of the mystacial pad. They also spread into the masseter branch of the trigeminal nerve to target the polar portions of the masseter muscle spindles. Retrograde double labelling, performed by injecting Dil into the pad and True Blue into the ipsilateral masseter muscle, showed labelled hypoglossal neurons in the medio-dorsal portion of the XII nucleus. The majority of these neurons were small (15-20 microm diameter), showed fluorescence for Dil and projected to the mystacial pad. Other medium-size neurons (25 microm diameter) were instead labelled with True Blue and projected to the masseter muscle. Finally, in the same area, other small hypoglossal neurons showed double labelling and projected to both structures. Functional hypotheses on the role of these hypoglossal projections have been discussed."
6,A comparison of the jaw mechanics in hadrosaurid and ceratopsid dinosaurs using finite element analysis.,"Hadrosaurid and ceratopsid dentaries display traits that suggest divergent functions toward broadly similar diets of fibrous plants. Computed tomographic scans of dentaries of a lambeosaurine and a centrosaurine (Centrosaurus aptertus) were used to compare feeding function of these animals using finite element analysis (FEA). In the hadrosaur, mediolateral expansion of the dentary and elongation of the coronoid process of the surangular were optimally developed to withstand torsion associated with transverse-isognathous jaw occlusion. FEA results strongly suggest longitudinal rotation of the hadrosaurid mandible. Mediolaterally compressed mandibles and FEA stress for the ceratopsid are in compliance with purely isognathous jaw adduction, although palinal retraction during the powerstroke cannot be ruled out. The ceratopsid dentary is further reinforced by a longitudinal ridge on the lateral surface of that element. Surface texture indicating Sharpey's fibers within the ceratopsid coronoid process suggests greater bite force than in lambeosaurines. These findings corroborate previous interpretations and suggest complementary or alternative kinematics to maxillary pleurokinesis in hadrosaurs."
6,A functional explanation for denticulation in theropod dinosaur teeth.,"The serrated, or denticulated, ziphodont teeth of theropod dinosaurs display variability in their extent of denticulation. The functional model proposed here tests the hypothesis that denticles will not exist in areas that do not frequently contact the substrate. This area, defined as the ""dead-space,"" is determined by the direction the tooth moves through the fleshy substrate. The extent of denticulation, as well as the dead-space dimensions, is measured from photographs of 235 isolated and in situ theropod teeth, to determine a meaningful relationship between the two variables. Both Euclidean and geometric morphometric methods are employed, and the data are expressed in bivariate and ordination plots. The model predicts the direction of tooth movement through the curvature of the tip/apex. Tooth position and taxon are considered. The results show that the mesial margin is usually partially denticulated, while the distal margin is usually totally denticulated. Curved teeth have large dead-spaces, and tend to be less denticulated mesially. Straighter teeth are more extensively denticulated, to the point where they became symmetrical. The mesial denticulation is determined by the dead-space, and dictated by the substrate contact. The dead-space almost always predicted less extensive denticulation; a consequence of the model's limitations. Tooth curvature increases with a more distal position, due to rotation based on the proximity to the hinge. Denticulation indicates that theropods used a distally oriented puncture to modify the substrate, similar to modern analogues. Although there is little taxonomic variation, Troodontidae show unique and extreme degrees of mesial denticulation."
6,Dental biofilm infections - an update.,"Teeth are colonized by oral bacteria from saliva containing more than 700 different bacterial species. If removed regularly, the dental biofilm mainly comprises oral streptococci and is regarded as resident microflora. But if left undisturbed, a complex biofilm containing up to 100 bacterial species at a site will build up and may eventually cause development of disease. Depending on local ecological factors, the composition of the dental biofilm may vary considerably. With access to excess carbohydrates, the dental biofilm will be dominated by mainly gram-positive carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria causing demineralization of teeth, dental caries, which may further lead to inflammation and necrosis in the pulp and periapical region, i.e., pulpitis and periapical periodontitis. In supra- and subgingival biofilms, predominantly gram-negative, anaerobic proteolytic bacteria will colonize and cause gingival inflammation and breakdown of supporting periodontal fibers and bone and ultimately tooth loss, i.e., gingivitis, chronic or aggressive periodontitis, and around dental implants, peri-implantitis. Furthermore, bacteria from the dental biofilm may spread to other parts of the body by bacteremia and cause systemic disease. Basically, prevention and treatment of dental biofilm infections are achieved by regular personal and professional removal of the dental biofilm."
6,Postsurgical Orthodontic Treatment Planning: a Case Report with 20 Years Follow-up.,"Traditionally, maxillofacial deformities are corrected surgically after an initial orthodontic treatment phase. However in, this article, the authors emphasize the postsurgical therapeutic protocol which is extremely important for determining the final and permanent retention of the corrected occlusion.A 55 year old female with severe skeletal Class II malocclusion is presented. Combined surgical and orthodontic correction of the malocclusion was used.: The step-by-step procedure the authors followed for the postsurgical therapy is described. The goals of the postoperative therapy were to restore and rehabilitate neuromuscular function, obtain occlusal stabilization, grind teeth selectively, and final occlusion retention. The importance of a surgical occlusal splint for rehabilitating stomatognathic neuromuscular function postoperatively was demonstrated. Furthermore, the orthodontic-prosthodontic treatment ensured occlusion stability after the surgical correction. The long-term results confirmed the efficacy of the treatment protocol presented here from both functional and aesthetical perspectives.Postsurgical orthodontic treatment is an important step in the surgical and orthodontic therapy of maxillofacial deformities."
6,Steinert syndrome and repercussions in dental medicine.,"Steinert syndrome, also called myotonic dystrophy type 1, is a genetic disorder with autosomal dominant transmission characterized by myotonia and a multisystemic clinical picture that affects several tissues of the human body. The most common systemic phenotypes are: muscular, cardiac, respiratory, CNS, ocular, gynecological, digestive, orthopedical, as well as cognitive and psychological symptoms (cognitive decline). Muscles involved in voluntary movement are highly affected by myotonia especially distal muscles of upper limbs. These patients also show changes in face, chewing and pharynx muscles that can lead to swallowing and speech problems, dysphagia and in most cases to food aspiration and suffocation. Poor oral hygiene resulting from reduced motor mobility and reduced saliva flux can lead to gingival inflammation and periodontal disease. Other oral manifestations include disturbances at the temporomandibular articulation, dental occlusion changes and reduction in teeth number as a result of caries. Main causes of death are pneumonia and cardiac arrhythmias. The etiopathogeny of this syndrome is still not clear, conditioning the existence of a specific treatment for this disease. Nowadays, treatments consist on the release of the existing symptoms, in an attempt to give a better life quality to patients. It is very important to implement actions that can prevent complications and consequently decrease death. Treatments should be applied in an early stage of the disease. Bronchoscopy and artificial respiration should be used to prevent pneumonia, and regular electrocardiographic monitoring should be done to evaluate defects in the conductive system. Several approaches have been applied to rehabilitate swallowing dysfunction and avoid aspiration like videofluoroscopy, postural techniques and adjustment of diet type. It is the aim of this paper to clarify the ethiology, diagnosis, systemic and oral characteristics of the syndrome, as well as to discuss treatments to be applied according to patients affected organs."
6,"[Geriatric dentistry: dental needs, problems, and expectations of residents of care homes].","Elderly people deserve respect and the right to receive appropriate medical assistance. This work was undertaken to determine the stomatognathic status of residents of Care Homes, condition of their dental prostheses, their main dental problems, expectations and needs, with emphasis on aspects of prosthetic treatment and psychosocial status.Altogether, 135 residents of the Care Homes were studied. It was found that the stomatognathic status of the residents was disappointing. The residents had problems with hygiene, their prosthetic appliances were in a poor condition, and they also experinced problems when using the prostheses. Prosthetic problems were noted in almost every resident of Care Homes.Expectations as to dental care cannot be fulfilled without changing the national health care system. A relationship between satisfaction in life and extent of prosthetic needs, condition of prosthetic appliances, and problems with their use was found. A positive life history plays an important role in past dental care.The psychosocial status of residents of Care Homes was poor."
6,Multidisciplinary treatment of patients after a surgery due to cancers in the facial area: a clinical reports.,"Prosthetic rehabilitation of patients after surgical removal of carcinoma in the facial skeleton is one of the most difficult problems in therapy of the stomatognathic system, due to increasing incidence of head and neck carcinoma. Significant deformations of tissues, development of dysfunctions of the stomatognathic system with concurrent biological unbalance of the oral cavity enviroment are frequently a consequence of the treatment. Cicatricial scars, contraction of the oral crevice and limitation of mobility of the tongue are noted in numerous cases. Deformations of the facial area of the skull and of structures of the temporo-mandibular joint are also the reasons of occlusion and articulation disturbances. Two cases of surgery due to carcinoma in the facial skeleton that have required combined and stepwise multispecialistic treatment performed at Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Department of Periodontology and Oral Disease, Dental Institute, Medical University of Warsaw are presented. The therapy has involved treatment of periodontitis and applying appropriate construction of prostheses that would relieve periodontium and splinting teeth."
6,The preexposure prophylaxis of stomatological diseases among the population of ukraine in the practice of the family doctor and the pediatrician.,"The dental health is one of the direct measures indicators of the population's health, integrated indicator of the nation's health, its invigoration and preservation are the most important medical, social and economic problems. The aim to investigate the position and the role of a family doctor and a pediatrician in the preexposure prophylaxis orthodontic pathology among the population of Ukraine.The book-semantic analysis of the scientific literature; the content analysis - research of the regulatory and legal framework; the system analysis - analysis of the system of doctors' carrying preexposure prophylaxis of the stomatological diseases.The health system reforming will allow approaching the preexposure medical aid to the population, providing its quality, a doctor's responsibility for his patients. One of the direction of a pediatrician's and a family doctor's work will be the prevention and early diagnosis of the orthodontic pathology, the advocacy promotion of the health alimentation and the healthy lifestyle for adults and children, saving the dental health in general."
6,"Prevalence and association of headaches, temporomandibular joint disorders, and occlusal interferences.","Although an interaction of malocclusion, parafunction, and temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) can be inferred from the experience of daily practice, scientific evidence to corroborate this hypothesis does not exist. However, there are indications that TMD and headaches may be intertwined.The purpose of this study was to identify the presence or absence of an association of occlusal interferences, parafunction, TMD, or physiologic, muscular, or prosthodontic factors with the occurrence of headache.In a private practice population of 1031 subjects (436 men and 595 women, mean age 49.6 years) the demographic parameters, headache and general pain history, habits and general personal information were recorded. Clinical examination for dental, muscular, and temporomandibular joint pathology was accomplished. Data were statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and Chi-Square tests (?? = .05). A multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed with respect to confounding variables.Headache affliction was found to affect women more frequently than men (1.7:1). Students and non academics were more prone to suffer from headache. Parafunction (P=.001), TMD (P=.001) and gross differences between centric occlusion and maximum intercuspation of more than a 3 mm visible track marked with 8 ??m articulation foil (P=.001) significantly influenced the presence of headache. Headache intensity and frequency decreased with age. While tension-type headache was most frequently diagnosed, the parameters studied were not significantly associated with one certain headache diagnosis more frequently than others.Stomatognathic factors of TMD, parafunction, and gross differences between centric occlusion and maximum intercuspation of more than 3 mm are associated with headache. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the cross-sectional nature of this study."
6,Temporomandibular joint ankylosis surgery in a child: case report.,"Temporomandibular joint ankylosis is one of the most significant disorders of the stomatognathic system because it causes pain associated with severe functional limitations, such as difficulty in chewing and psychological and clinical problems due to poor oral hygiene. These disorders  are quite significant in children, since the treatment is even more complex due to the fact that the condylar region is a site of active growth. The earlier the diagnosis is established, the better the treatment prognosis. Ankylosis can be treated by interposition arthroplasty of the temporalis  muscle fascia in conjunction with ipsilateral coronoidectomy. The purpose of the present study was to report a clinical case of temporomandibular joint ankylosis in a pediatric patient treated by interposition arthroplasty of the temporalis muscle fascia associated with coronoidectomy."
6,Socioeconomic inequalities in dental health among middle-aged adults and the role of behavioral and psychosocial factors: evidence from the Spanish National Health Survey.,"The goal of this analysis was to describe socioeconomic inequalities in dental health among Spanish middle-aged adults, and the role of behavioral and psychosocial factors in explaining these inequalities.This cross-sectional study used survey data from the 2006 Spanish National Health Survey and focused on adults ages 30 - 64. The outcome was dental health status based on the presence of self-reported dental problems. We used education, income, and occupational class as indicators of socioeconomic position and applied logistic regression analysis to estimate associations. We included behavioral and psychosocial variables in the models and compared non-adjusted to adjusted estimates to assess their potential role in explaining socioeconomic gradients.Results showed clear socioeconomic gradients in dental health among middle-aged adults. The percentage of people who reported more dental problems increased among those with lower levels of education, income, and occupation. These gradients were statistically significant (p?€?<?€?.001). Logistic regression showed that groups with lower education, income, and occupation had higher odds of reporting the outcome (p?€?<?€?.001). Associations were stronger when considering education as the indicator of socioeconomic position. Substantial unexplained associations remained significant after adjusting the model by behavioral and psychosocial variables.This study shows significant socioeconomic gradients in dental health among middle-aged adults in Spain. Behavioral and psychosocial variables were insufficient to explain the inequalities described, suggesting the intervention of other factors. Further research should incorporate additional explanations to better understand and comprehensively address socioeconomic inequalities in dental health."
6,Cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) imaging of the oral and maxillofacial region: a systematic review of the literature.,"This study reviewed the literature on cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) imaging of the oral and maxillofacial (OMF) region. A PUBMED search (National Library of Medicine, NCBI; revised 1 December 2007) from 1998 to December 2007 was conducted. This search revealed 375 papers, which were screened in detail. 176 papers were clinically relevant and were analyzed in detail. CBCT is used in OMF surgery and orthodontics for numerous clinical applications, particularly for its low cost, easy accessibility and low radiation compared with multi-slice computerized tomography. The results of this systematic review show that there is a lack of evidence-based data on the radiation dose for CBCT imaging. Terminology and technical device properties and settings were not consistent in the literature. An attempt was made to provide a minimal set of CBCT device-related parameters for dedicated OMF scanners as a guideline for future studies."
6,"Growing burden of noncommunicable diseases: the contributory role of oral diseases, Eastern Mediterranean Region perspective.","Associations of oral diseases with noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, osteoporosis and chronic renal failure are widely reported in the literature from developed countries. Commonality of risk factors, changes in systemic inflammatory mediators and body metabolism play a role in this association. This paper reviews current knowledge on the burden and association of oral and systemic diseases, and highlights the paucity of information and research from the Eastern Mediterranean Region and other developing countries. A call is made for further research to understand the status and significance of oral-systemic disease associations and develop guidelines for their control in this Region."
6,"Light and scanning electron microscopic study on the tongue and lingual papillae of the common hippopotamus, Hippopotamus amphibius amphibius.","We observed the three-dimensional structures of the external surface and connective tissue cores CTCs, after exfoliation of the epithelium of the lingual papillae (filiform, fungiform, and foliate papillae) of the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius amphibius) using scanning electron microscopy and conventional light microscopy. Following unique features were found; typical vallate papillae with a circumferential furrow were not observable. Instead, numerous large fungiform papillae were rather densely distributed on the posterior of the lingual prominence. Taste buds were observable only on the dorsal epithelium. Serous lingual gland was not seen in the lamina propria; however, mucous-rich mixed lingual glands were found and in a few of orifices were seen on the large fungiform tops. Lingual prominence was diminished their width. Rather long and slender conical papillae were distributed on the lingual prominence and were similar to nonruminant herbivore, that is donkey. Beside this narrow lingual prominence, lateral slopes were situated with numerous short spine-like protrusions. After removal of the epithelium, CTCs of lateral slopes exhibited attenuated flower bud structures. Large-conical papillae were situated on the root of the tongue. These large conical papillae were not seen among ruminants and seen on the lingual root of omnivores and carnivores. It implies that lingual structure of common hippopotamus possessed mixed characteristics between Perissodactyls, Ruminantia, and nonherbivores such as Suiformes because of their unique evolutionally taxonomic position. Moreover, adaptation for soft grass diet and associating easier mastication may be also affecting these mixed morphological features of the tongue."
6,"Occlusion, sternocleidomastoid muscle activity, and body sway: a pilot study in male astronauts.","The modifications induced by microgravity on the coordinated patterns of movement of the head, trunk, and limbs are reported on extensively. However, apparently there is little data on the masticatory muscles. In normal gravitational conditions, information from the neck and stomatognathic apparatus play a role in maintaining the body's balance and equilibrium. The current pilot study used normal gravity conditions to investigate the hypothesis of a functional coupling between occlusion and neck muscles and body postural oscillations. The immediate effect of modified occlusal surfaces on the contraction pattern of the sternocleidomastoid muscles during maximum voluntary clenching and on the oscillation of the center of foot pressure was analyzed in 11 male astronauts (aged 31-54 yrs). All subjects were healthy and free from pathologies of the neck and stomatognathic apparatus. Occlusal splints were prepared using impressions of their dental arches. The splints were modeled on the mandibular arch, had only posterior contacts, and were modified to obtain a more symmetric, standardized contraction of the masseter and temporalis muscles during teeth clenching. Surface EMG activity of the sternocleidomastoid muscles was recorded during a maximal voluntary clench with and without the splint. Sternocleidomastoid potentials were standardized as percent of the mean potentials recorded during a maximum contralateral rotation of the head, and the symmetry of the EMG waves of left- and right-side muscles was measured. Body sway was assessed with and without the splint, either with eyes open or closed. The variations of the center of foot pressure were analyzed through bivariate analysis, and the area of the 90% standard ellipse was computed. Within each visual condition (eyes open or closed), the difference between the areas of oscillation measured with and without the splint was computed. Muscular activity was more symmetric with the splint. The area of oscillation of the center of foot pressure was larger without the splint than with the splint, both with eyes open and eyes closed. The modifications, induced by the occlusal splint in the sternocleidomastoid muscles' symmetry, and center of foot pressure differential area with closed eyes, were significantly related (p < 0.05): the larger the increment in muscular symmetry, the smaller the area of oscillation with the splint as compared to without the splint. A functionally more symmetric maxillo-mandibular position resulted in a more symmetric sternocleidomastoid muscle contraction pattern and less body sway. Modifications in the contraction of the masticatory muscles may therefore affect the whole body."
6,"A survey of awareness related to the use of antibiotics for dental issues among non-medical female university students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Inappropriate use of antibiotics may lead to adverse side effects. This cross-sectional survey aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitude of female non-medical students regarding the medical and dental use of antibiotics. Four hundred validated self-administered questionnaires were distributed in Princess Norah Bint-Abdurrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire included questions about accessibility, attitude toward usage, efficacy, side effects, resistance, and usage for dental issues. Knowledge was estimated for every respondent by counting the correct answers, which were considered as points. The scores were categorized as poor, moderate, and high. Of the respondents, 77.8% answered they get antibiotics according to a doctor's prescription; however, 31% stops taking antibiotics when they feel well. Only 38.8% of respondents knew that antibiotics may cause allergic reactions while 59.8% believed the human body can be resistant to antibiotics. The percentages of answers related to dental issues were: antibiotics relieve dental pain (68.8%), antibiotics can be harmful for children's teeth (27.3%), antibiotics are best avoided in pregnancy (56.7%) and no need for antibiotics after scaling (33.8%), root canal treatment (16%), or simple extraction (40.3%). Of respondents, 68% had poor scores about antibiotics efficacy, side effects, and resistance while 86.8% had poor scores related to dental problems. This study noticed a bad attitude related to antibiotics usage, with many misconceptions and poor knowledge. Moreover, the necessity of antibiotics for treatment of dental disease or after dental procedures was totally unclear for the respondents. Community campaigns are recommended every university semester to educate students about the indications, efficacy, and side effects of antibiotics."
6,Methods for objectively assessing clinical masticatory performance: protocol for a systematic review.,"Chewing and masticatory function constitutes one of the most important oral health factors that affect quality of life, especially in older individuals. Little consensus currently exists regarding ways to objectively assess clinical masticatory performance (in this context, performance refers an individual's objective ability to mix or comminute food bolus). That said, many methods were developed to assess masticatory performance. Consequently, systematic review of the literature would be of great value when it comes to identifying various methods for objectively assessing clinical masticatory performance and for evaluating these methods.This study protocol describes a systematic review that intends to (i) identify methods to objectively assess clinical masticatory performance and (ii) evaluate psychometric properties (such as validity and reliability) of the identified methods. A systematic literature search is required to do so in these sources: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (embase.com), Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters), Cochrane (Wiley), and Cinahl (Ebsco).studies in scientific, full-text articles; development articles; validation articles; studies of the general adult population, ages ???18.topics and article types that cover interview methods and self-reported questionnaires; methods/instruments that measure subjective masticatory performance; qualitative studies and case studies; opinion and editorial pieces; animal studies; studies of humans with severe oral health complications.This systematic review will result in a comprehensive assessment of various methods designed to objectively measure clinical masticatory performance. This systematic review will rate these methods, assess their reliability and validity, and identify one or more methods that can be recommended for use in clinical and scientific environments. From what is currently known, no systematic evaluation of various methods for objectively assessing clinical masticatory performance has been published.PROSPERO CRD42016037700."
6,Dental and Temporomandibular Joint Pathology of the California Mountain Lion (Puma concolor couguar).,"Skulls from 91 California mountain lions (Puma concolor couguar) were examined macroscopically and radiographically. The majority of the skulls were from young adult animals (57.1%). The skull specimens were from 42 male (46.1%) and 34 female (37.4%) animals, while the gender was unknown for the remainder. The majority (94.5%) of teeth were present for examination. Only 11 teeth were identified as absent congenitally; five of these teeth were maxillary first molar teeth and three were maxillary second premolar teeth. Abnormal tooth morphology was identified in 3.5% of teeth. The most common abnormality in tooth form was abnormally large crowns of the maxillary first molar teeth. Teeth with an abnormal number of roots were uncommon (n??=??21). Ninety-one teeth were found to have an abnormal number of roots, most often two-rooted maxillary first molar teeth instead of the expected one root. The most prevalent dental lesions found in the California mountain lion were attrition/abrasion (93.4%), tooth fractures (80.2%) and periodontitis (38.5%). Less common dental lesions were tooth resorption (n??=??32 teeth) and endodontal disease (n??=??29 teeth)."
6,Dental and Temporomandibular Joint Pathology of??the American Black Bear (Ursus americanus).,"Museum specimens (maxillae and/or mandibles) from 371 American black bears (Ursus americanus) acquired between 1889 and 2006 were examined macroscopically according to predefined criteria, and 348 were included in this study. Of the 348 specimens, 126 (36.2%) were from male animals, 106 (30.5%) were from female animals and 116 (33.3%) were from animals of unknown sex. Specimen ages ranged from young adult (n??=??63, 18.1%) to adult (n??=??285, 81.9%), with juveniles excluded from the study. The number of teeth available for examination was 12,019 (82.2%); 7.0% of teeth were absent artefactually, 0.4% were deemed absent due to acquired tooth loss and 9.7% were absent congenitally. In 43 specimens (12.3%), 82 teeth (0.68%) were small vestigial structures with crowns that were flush with the level of surrounding alveolar bone. The remaining teeth (99.3%) were of normal morphology. Only three supernumerary teeth and three instances of enamel hypoplasia were encountered. Persistent deciduous teeth or teeth with an aberrant number of roots were not encountered in any of the specimens. Approximately one-third of the teeth examined (4,543, 37.8%) displayed attrition/abrasion, affecting nearly all of the specimens (n??=??338, 97.1%). Incisor and molar teeth accounted for 52.5% and 34.3% of the affected teeth, respectively, with significantly more adults affected than young adults. Dental fractures were noted in 63 bears, affecting 18.1% of specimens and 1.0% of the total number of present teeth. The canine teeth were most often fractured, with adults having significantly more complicated crown fractures of these teeth than young adults. There were 11 specimens (3.2%) that displayed periapical lesions, affecting 12 (0.1%) dental alveoli. There were 179 specimens (51.4%) displaying bony changes indicative of periodontitis, affecting 816 (6.8%) dental alveoli. The proportion of adult bears affected by periodontitis (57.9%) was significantly greater than that of young adults (22.2%). Exactly half of the specimens (n??=??174) possessed lesions consistent with mild temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis. The occurrence and severity of the dental pathology encountered in this study may play an important role in the morbidity and mortality of the American black bear."
6,Effect of Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound on a Rat Model of Dentin-Dental Pulp Injury and Repair.,"This study investigated histopathologic changes in dental pulp after treatment with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS). Fifty rats were randomly divided into an experimental group (n??=??25) and a blank control group (n??=??25). In the experimental group, a cavity was prepared in the bilateral maxillary first molars. The upper right first molars were stimulated with LIPUS (30??mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1.5??MHz) for 20??min/d. The cavities prepared in the left teeth were used as experimental controls (i.e., no LIPUS). Five rats in each group were sacrificed at days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14. Inflammatory response was visible at different time points after cavity preparation, peaking at day 3, after which it gradually weakened. More reparative dentin was found on the LIPUS treatment side. transforming growth factor-??1 expression increased after treatment, peaking at day 5 and returning to normal at day 14 on both sides, but was stronger with LIPUS treatment. SMAD2 and SMAD3 expressions in the dental pulp gradually increased after cavity preparation, especially in the experimental group. LIPUS promoted the repair of dentin-pulp complex injury, to a certain extent and should be investigated further as a potential therapy."
6,Prevalence of dental problems in recreational SCUBA divers: a pilot survey.,"Objective To determine the prevalence of dental symptoms in recreational scuba divers and describe the distribution of these symptoms on the basis of diver demographics, diving qualifications and dive conditions during the episode of dental pain.Design A survey was designed and distributed through online social media platforms dedicated to scuba diving. A convenience sample of 100 recreational divers was obtained by this method.Main outcome measures The outcome measures of interest were: diver demographics, diving characteristics (level of certification, number of dives completed), occurrence of dental problems during a dive, and details of the episode.Results Forty-one percent of the respondents experienced dental symptoms during a dive. Barodontalgia was the most frequently experienced dental symptom during a dive.Conclusion Within the limits of the small sample size and online method of recruitment, the findings of this study suggest that a high proportion of recreational divers may experience dental symptoms during a dive. It would be meaningful to ensure that dental decay and damaged restorations are addressed before a dive and that the mouthpiece design be evaluated in case of complaints of temporomandibular discomfort during a dive."
6,Masticator space masses and pseudomasses.,"We review the anatomy of the masticator space and the localization of masticator space lesions on cross-sectional imaging. The magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography appearances of inflammatory, neoplastic, developmental and vascular masticator space lesions are discussed and illustrated. Benign processes and normal variations, which mimic masticator space pathology, are also considered."
6,The chiton stylus canal: An element delivery pathway for tooth cusp biomineralization.,"A detailed investigation of the stylus canal situated within the iron mineralized major lateral teeth of the chiton Acanthopleura hirtosa was undertaken in conjunction with a row-by-row examination of cusp mineralization. The canal is shown to contain columnar epithelial tissue similar to that surrounding the mineralized cusps, including the presence of iron rich particles characteristic of the iron storage protein ferritin. Within the tooth core, a previously undescribed internal pathway or plume is evident above the stylus canal, between the junction zone and mineralizing posterior face of the cusp. Plume formation coincides with the appearance of iron in the superior epithelium and the onset of mineralization at tooth row 13. The plume persists during the delivery of phosphorous and calcium into the tooth core, and is the final region of the cusp to become mineralized. The presence of the stylus canal was confirmed in a further 18 chiton species, revealing that the canal is common to polyplacophoran molluscs. These new data strongly support the growing body of evidence highlighting the importance of the junction zone for tooth mineralization in chiton teeth, and indicate that the chemical and structural environment within the tooth cusp is under far greater biological control than previously considered."
6,Do malocclusion and Helkimo Index ??? 5 correlate with body posture?,"Whether there are correlations between the stomatognathic system and body posture remains controversial. Here, we have investigated whether malocclusal traits and having a Helkimo Index ??? 5 show detectable correlations with body-posture alterations in children and young adults. A total of 1178 11- to 19-year-old subjects were divided into four groups: (i) controls; (ii) malocclusion; (iii) Helkimo Index ??? 5 and (iv) malocclusion + Helkimo Index ??? 5. Dental occlusion assessment included the following: overbite, overjet, posterior crossbite, scissorbite, mandibular crowding and dental class. Subsequently, body-posture assessments were performed through static analyses of body inclination and trunk asymmetry, and according to the dynamic Fukuda stepping test. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. Although at the univariate level both the trunk asymmetry and Fukuda stepping test showed significant differences among the groups, the multivariate level revealed that age and gender were mostly responsible for this. The only significant correlation that was seen was for the malocclusion + Helkimo Index ??? 5 group: these subjects had a positive (worse) trunk asymmetry and a negative (better) Fukuda stepping test performance. At the further multivariate analyses of each single malocclusal trait ???Helkimo Index ??? 5 (irrespective of the groups), only an increased overbite showed a statistically significant association with a slightly better Fukuda stepping test performance. Given the small number of significant associations seen and their limited entities, this study does not support the existence of clinically relevant correlations for malocclusal traits and Helkimo Index ??? 5 with body posture in children and young adults."
6,Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy.,Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is an upper airway evaluation technique in which fiberoptic examination is performed under conditions of unconscious sedation. Unique information obtained from this 3-dimensional examination of the airway potentially provides additive benefits to other evaluation methods to guide treatment selection. This article presents recommendations regarding DISE technique and the VOTE Classification system for reporting DISE findings and reviews the evidence concerning DISE test characteristics and the association between DISE findings and treatment outcomes.
6,Preliminary rapport on head posture and muscle activity in subjects with class I and II.,"Forward head posture may cause alterations in the stomatognathic system, including changes in the muscle activity of the masticatory muscles and dental occlusion alterations. Considering the need for further understanding of the relationship between the stomatognathic system and the cervical region, the purpose of this study was to analyse the head posture and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the anterior portion of temporal and masseter muscles bilaterally among bruxist's subjects with different dental occlusion classifications using the Angle method. The study consisted of 20 female volunteers, between the ages of 17 and 27 years. They were separated into two groups (class I and class II occlusions) according to a dentist-performed evaluation. An assessment of forward head posture was conducted using a photographic technique (angular calculus) combined with a clinical analysis. In the EMG analyses, active differential surface electrodes (Ag) were utilized and were placed bilaterally on the belly of masseter and temporal muscles, perpendicular to the muscles fibres. The EMG signal recorded during bilateral isotonic mastication, was presented using the Root Mean Square and was processed by Matlab software. The results indicated that the EMG responses of temporal and masseter muscles tend to be modified by occlusion alteration class II. Subjects with class II occlusion tended to present more occurrence of forward head posture with alterations in the muscle activity pattern between masseter and temporal muscles."
6,A novel method of removing artifacts because of metallic dental restorations in 3-D CT images of jaw bone.,"CT images, especially in a three-dimensional (3-D) mode, give valuable information for oral implant surgery. However, image quality is often severely compromised by artifacts originating from metallic dental restorations, and an effective solution for artifacts is being sought. This study attempts to substitute the damaged areas of the jaw bone images with dental cast model images obtained by CT. The position of the dental cast images was registered to that of the jaw bone images using a devised interface that is composed of an occlusal bite made of self-curing acrylic resin and a marker plate made of gypsum. The patient adapted this interface, and CT images of the stomatognathic system were filmed. On the other hand, this interface was placed between the upper and lower cast models and filmed by CT together with the cast models. The position of the marker plate imaged with the dental casts was registered to those adapted by the patient. The error of registration was examined to be 0.25 mm, which was satisfactory for clinical application. The damaged region in the cranial bone images as an obstacle for implant surgery was removed and substituted with the trimmed images of the dental cast. In the method developed here, the images around the metallic compounds severely damaged by artifacts were successfully reconstructed, and the stomatognathic system images became clear, and this is useful for implant surgery."
6,Dental pathology in dolphins (Cetacea: Delphinidae) from the southern coast of Brazil.,"Pathological processes observed in the stomatognathic systems of mammalian species are a useful source of information about the habits, evolution and general health of such animals. Studies of pathological conditions on teeth are common in humans and other primates, but rare in wild animals in general and marine mammals in particular. For cetaceans, previous studies provided scanty records of dental anomalies in a few species. This is the first broad and systematic inventory of dental pathology in dolphins. Specimens stored at scientific collections from the southern coast of Brazil were visually inspected under a stereoscopic microscope using a dental explorer. Diagnosis of lesions and anomalies followed literature descriptions. Abnormalities such as caries-like lesions, mineralized calculus deposits, dental erosion, enamel anomalies (hypoplasia and exogenous pigmentation), root resorption, germination and other shape anomalies, were diagnosed in the delphinids Sotalia guianensis, Delphinus capensis, Stenella frontalis, Stenella coeruleoalba, Lagenodelphis hosei, Pseudorca crassidens, Orcinus orca, Steno bredanensis and Tursiops truncatus. Endogenous causes may be related to the occurrence of certain conditions, but the aetiology of caries-like lesions and calculus accumulation is still unknown for cetaceans. The diagnosis of alveolar anomalies and other bone lesions in specimens with dental pathology lead us to believe these lesions modify the integrity of the periodontal ligament and bony tissues, adding to the burden of morbidity of affected animals."
6,Chronic daily headache: suggestion for the neuromuscular oral therapy.,"Tweny patients (M: 4, F: 16, mean age 37??????11??years) with diagnosis of chronic daily headache (CDH), after drug withdrawal, were under electromyography, kinesiography and masticatory muscle deprogramming by TENS to identify the physiological rest position of the mandible. Our purpose was to clarify a possible role of the neuromuscular stomatognathic system. Examinations showed that 17 patients needed a neuromuscular orthosis, an occlusal device, to provisionally correct the detected discrepancies of jaw position. Of those, the 10 patients who showed an occlusal sagittal discrepancy higher than 2??mm and/or a lateral deviation higher than 0.4??mm, associated with more than three parafunctional activities, had a meaningful decrease on frequency/intensity of migraine crisis and/or of days of headache. VAS pain score during crisis decreased from 9.0??????0.9 to 4.9??????2.7; frequency of crisis were from 20.7??????5.2 to 9.5??????7.7. Baseline pain were from 5.3??????1.2 to 3.0??????1.3. Satisfying clinical results can be reached combining behavioural education and neuromuscular orthosis. This can be very helpful in patients who show significant discrepancy of jaw position that only TENS deprogramming can reveal and kinesiography can detect with such accuracy."
6,Headache: short- and long-term effectiveness of a prefabricated appliance compared to a stabilization appliance.,"To compare the short- and long-term effectiveness of a prefabricated occlusal appliance with that of a stabilization appliance when treating headache in patients with myofascial pain.Sixty-six patients, 94% of whom suffered concomitantly from headache, at two centres for Stomatognathic Physiology in Sweden and Finland were included in a randomized controlled trial. History questionnaires and clinical examination according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders were used at baseline and at 10-week and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Patients were randomly assigned to either a prefabricated (R) or a stabilization appliance (S) group.There were significant decreases in the frequency and intensity of headache in both groups at all follow-ups, without statistically significant differences between groups. At baseline, 23 patients in both groups reported recurrent-continuous headache and, at 12 months, seven in the R group and four in the S group. The mean intensity (numeric rating scale) of headache prior to treatment decreased significantly at 12 months from 5.3 to 2.1 in the R group and from 6.1 to 2.9 in the S group. At the 12-month follow-up, 56% of patients in the R group reported a 30% reduction in intensity of headache and 50% a 50% reduction. In the S group, corresponding values were 39% and 36%, respectively. Non-specific physical symptoms were significantly associated with frequency of headache at baseline and at 6 months, and with depression at 6 and 12 months.The effectiveness of the prefabricated appliance seems to be similar to that of the stabilization appliance in the treatment of headache in patients with myofascial pain in both the short and long term."
6,Quantitative analysis of masticatory activity during unilateral mastication using muscle fMRI.,"Quantitative analysis of the activities of all masticatory muscles is required to elucidate the mechanism of stomatognathic dysfunction. Electromyography can be used to record the activity of masticatory muscles, but quantification of the overall activity of every masticatory muscle has not been accomplished because of methodological limitations. In this study, we used muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging for simultaneous quantification of the overall activities of the masseter, medial pterygoid and lateral pterygoid muscles during unilateral gum chewing.Seven healthy male volunteers participated in the study. We evaluated changes in the mean proton transverse relaxation time in the bilateral masseter, medial pterygoid and lateral pterygoid muscles before and after unilateral gum chewing, and to quantify the overall activity of these muscles simultaneously during unilateral gum chewing.After 5 min of chewing, the activity of the ipsilateral masseter was highest among the six muscles, followed by the ipsilateral medial pterygoid, contralateral lateral pterygoid and contralateral masseter muscles.These results affirm the importance of the ipsilateral masseter muscle and quantitatively demonstrate the important contribution of the ipsilateral medial pterygoid and contralateral lateral pterygoid muscles during unilateral mastication."
6,A prototype mobile application for triaging dental emergencies.,"Evidence suggests that dental emergencies are likely to occur when preferred care is less accessible. Communication barriers often exist that cause patients to receive suboptimal treatment or experience discomfort for extended lengths of time. Furthermore, limitations in the conventional approach for managing dental emergencies prevent dentists from receiving critical information before patient visits.The authors developed a mobile application to mediate the uncertainty of dental emergencies. The development and study consisted of a needs analysis and quality assessment of intraoral images captured by smartphones, prototype development, refining the prototype through usability inspection methods, and formative evaluation through usability testing with prospective users.The developed application successfully guided all users through a series of questions designed to capture clinically meaningful data by using familiar smartphone functions. All participants were able to complete a report within 4 minutes, and all clinical information was comprehended by the users.Patient-provided information accompanied by high-resolution images may help dentists substantially in predicting urgency or preparing necessary treatment resources. The results illustrate the feasibility of patients using smartphone applications to report dental emergencies. This technology allows dentists to assess care remotely when direct patient contact is less practical.This study's results demonstrate that patients can use mobile applications to transmit clinical data to their dentists and suggest the possibility of expanding the use of mobile applications to enhance access to routine and emergency dental care. The authors addressed how to enable patients to communicate emergency needs directly to a dentist while obviating patient emergency department visits."
6,Validation and improvement of a predictive model for treatment outcome in patients with temporomandibular disorders.,"To examine whether it was possible to improve individual prediction of treatment outcome in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) through continuous quality improvement registrations and implementation of changes in clinical routines.All 5777 patients referred to a specialist clinic for stomatognathic physiology; 2187 TMD patients started treatment. The patients were divided into Muscle or Mainly TMJ symptom groups. Actual treatment outcome was predicted as Good or Dubious based on patient history and clinical findings. The degree of improvement of initial symptoms was graded using a numeric rating scale 0-100. Improvement in initial complaints of 50% or more was judged as a clinically important difference (CID); 989 patients (76%) completed treatment 1992-1998 (Sample 1) and 769 (86%) treatment 1999-2004 (Sample 2).For patients with Muscle symptoms in Sample 1, CID was reached by 90% of those predicted Good and by 56% of those predicted Dubious. In Sample 2, the figures were Good 93% and Dubious 57%. In subgroup Mainly TMJ symptoms, CID was reached by 94% of those predicted Good and by 88% if predicted Dubious in Sample 1. In Sample 2, the figures were the same for those predicted Good, i.e. 94%, and Dubious, 73%.Continuous quality improvement registrations and implementation of changes in clinical routines improved the ability to predict individually the actual treatment outcome between patients predicted Good or Dubious, respectively. Rheumatic disease turned out not to be a negative predictor for treatment outcome."
6,"[Relationship between dysfunctions and parafunctional oral habits, and temporomandibular disorders in children and teenagers].","Oral parafunctional habits and orofacial myofunctional dysfunctions are commonly observed in children and considered as contributory factors for temporomandibular disorders (TMD). The aim of this work was to describe the frequency of oral parafunctional habits and orofacial myofunctional dysfunctions and to evaluate the association between them and signs and symptoms of TMD in patients attending to the TMD section of the Pediatric Dentistry Department of the University of Buenos Aires.Data obtained from dental records performed during 2003-2007 were entered into a database registering age, gender, reason for consultation, psychological stress, signs, symptoms, diagnosis, dysfunctions and parafunctions, for statistical analysis.The sample was constituted by 133 patients (average age: 12 +/- 3 years old). Ninety six percent of patients showed dysfunctions and/or parafunctions. Regarding dysfunctions, they were present in 78% of the sample; 48% had dysfunctional swallowing; 45% oral and mixed breathing, and 29% chewing food on one preferred side. With regard to parafunctions, bruxism was present in 74% of cases, gum chewing habit in 55%, nail biting in 48%, biting in 28%, jaw play in 22%, and sucking in 14%. TMD symptoms were associated with total dysfunctions and parafunctions (p <0.05). Using multivariate analysis, results showed a significant correlation between masticatory dysfunction and clicking joint noise (p= 0.023) and bruxism as reason for consultation (p= 0.018).Dysfunctions and parafunctions showed in this study a high prevalence and were significantly associated with TMD symptoms."
6,A comparison of cephalometric analysis using radiographs and craniofacial computed tomography in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: preliminary report.,"The aim of this study was to describe the similarities and differences as well as the convenience in using of cephalometric radiographs and craniofacial computed tomography in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients and to demonstrate the relationship between the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and severity of cephalometric abnormalities. A total of 28 randomly selected patients with snoring, and varying degrees of sleep-disordered breathing were included in this study. A control group included 22 patients. These patients had no snoring or clinical evidence of sleep-disordered breathing as evaluated by polysomnographic test. No patients had prior pharyngeal or maxillomandibular surgery. All patients were evaluated by otolaryngological examination and had polysomnography, cephalometric radiographs and craniofacial CT scans. In study group the evaluation between cephalometric analysis on radiographs and CT scans was made. The comparison between the control and the study group was also assessed as far as cephalometric data are concerned. The cephalometric parameters revealed major differences between controls and patients with OSAS regarding the size and position of soft palate and uvula, volume and position of tongue, hyoid position, mandibulo-maxillary protrusion and size of the pharyngeal airway space. OSAS is associated with statistically significant changes in cephalometric measurements. Lateral cephalometric analysis and craniofacial CT scans add further information to the anatomical assessment of patients with OSAS. We found craniofacial CT scan measurements to be easier and more accurate especially when applying to soft tissues. We believe that this method may also be useful for patient classification to surgical procedures."

6,Oral health care-related beliefs among Finnish geriatric home care nurses.,"The aim was to investigate beliefs about oral health care tasks among nursing staff caring for home-dwelling older people using the Nursing Dental Coping Beliefs (nursing DCBS) index.The study population comprised nursing staff working at the homes and sheltered accommodations of older people in Ylivieska, Finland (N = 141). The data were collected using the nursing DCBS index (five-point Likert scale).On average, the nurses held moderate to high Oral health care beliefs, Internal locus of control beliefs and External locus of control beliefs, but low beliefs about Self-efficacy. The nurses with an earlier adjunct education scored lower for Oral health care beliefs on the factor Knowledge about preventing gum diseases (OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9) than did the others. Regarding beliefs about External locus of control, the age group 31-49 years scored lower on the factor Retaining teeth as one ages (OR = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.7), but scored higher on the factor How to prevent dental diseases (OR = 5.6, 95% CI: 1.1-29.3) than did younger nurses (???30 years). The nurses with only a nursing education showed significantly higher mean scores on the Self-efficacy factor Confidence of the need for dental knowledge than did those with an earlier adjunct education (P = 0.034).The nursing staff mostly believed that oral diseases are preventable and teeth can be retained in advanced age, but failed to recognize the value of dental knowledge and had little confidence in their ability to manage oral diseases. Improving the oral health-related knowledge and self-efficacy beliefs of nursing staff will require additional oral health education."
6,Prosthodontic management of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.,"Ectodermal dysplasia is characterized by the absence or defects of two or more ectodermally derived structures. Anodontia or hypodontia is the most striking dental manifestation. In severe hypodontia, there is lack of alveolar development with consequent protrusion and eversion of the lips. Patients with anhidrotic forms suffer from heat intolerance due to lack of sweat glands and mild infections may lead to death in infancy from hyperthermia. A case of a 4-year-old child with anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with partial anodontia is presented. Dental, oral, and physical features were taken into consideration in diagnosis and treatment planning for this patient. Clinical management consisted of removable partial prosthesis in maxillary arch and complete denture prosthesis in mandibular arch. The main aim of the treatment was to improve psychological development and to promote better functioning of the stomatognathic system."
6,Dental problems in epileptic patients.,"On the grounds of literature and own clinical experience, pathological changes in epilepitic patients have been described. Dental management procedures in these patients have also been presented. The unquestionable importance of prophylaxis, which may markedly minimize the impact of epilepsy on the incidence of mouth diseases, has been emphasised. It has also been stated that epileptic patients should receive specialised and integrated dental treatment."
6,Auriculo-vestibular symptoms related to structural and functional disorders of stomatognatic system.,"Auriculo-vestibular symptoms are otolaryngological complaints which frequently co-occur with functional disorders of masticatory organ. These symptoms include: earache, plugged ears sensation, sudden hearing impairment, burning pain of the throat, tinnitus, and dizziness. The aim of the study was assessment of co-occurrence of functional disorders of masticatory organ and auriculo-vestibular symptoms, in patients referred for otolaryngological treatment. Forty-two patients aged 24-46 years of both sexes referred for otolaryngological treatment, because of auriculo-vestibular symptoms, were qualified to our study within the framework of research project. After otolaryngological diagnostics (Department of Otolaryngology), these patients were referred for prosthetic consultation to the Department of Dental Prosthetics of Jagiellonian University Medical College. In Otolaryngology Clinic the following specialist examinations were carried out: basic clinical examinations, including otoscopy, tuning fork trials, tonal and verbal audiometry, and tympanometry. These examinations were supplemented with electronystagmometry. On prosthetic consultation, specialist functional investigations of masticatory organ, and electromyographic assessment of the activity of masseter muscles and the anterior part of the temporal muscle, were carried out. Results of the investigation revealed otolarygological causes of the reported symptoms in 30 patients, whereas in 12 patients (out of 42 patients referred for prosthetic consultation), numerous functional disorders of the stomatognathic system were observed. The investigation confirmed the occurrence of functional disorders in patients with auriculo-vestibular symptoms and appropriateness of treatment by a multi-specialist team."
6,Combination syndrome symptomatology and treatment.,"Combination syndrome (CS) is one of the most fascinating oral conditions yet is poorly understood and underappreciated in the literature and clinical practice. This article reviews the most important literature on this subject and analyzes the etiology, symptomatology, diagnosis, and current therapeutic modalities for treatment in an attempt to better understand CS. The syndrome represents an example ofa complex pathologic condition of the entire stomatognathic system with a multitude of hard-tissue, soft-tissue, and occlusal changes. These changes, initiated by a certain sequence of events, beginning with a prolonged period of tooth loss, can lead to severe bone atrophy in different regions of the jaws, loss of masticatory function, and the need for complex treatment. Implant rehabilitation of these patients in a preventative approach with cooperation of the entire dental team is emphasized."
6,Macroglossia.,"Macroglossia is defined as an enlarged tongue and it is usually clinically diagnosed. Pseudomacryglossia concerns a tongue that is of normal size but gives a false impression of being too large in relation to adjacent anatomical structures. The causes of macroglossia are numerous and this is why various classifications have been proposed for this condition. The consequences of macroglossia usually include a possible malfunction of the stomatognathic system, breathing and speech problems, increased mandible size, tooth spacing, diastema and other orthodontic abnormalities. The treatment of macroglossia depends on its aetiology and generally includes correcting the systemic disease underlying the increase in lingual mass, surgical treatment, radiotherapy and treatment of orthodontic abnormalities that might have been caused by the condition."
6,Oro-dental features of Pallister-Killian syndrome: Evaluation of 21 European probands.,"Pallister-Killian syndrome (PKS) is a rare sporadic multi-systemic developmental disorder caused by a mosaic tetrasomy of the short arm of chromosome 12. A wide range of clinical characteristics including intellectual disability, seizures, and congenital malformations has previously been described. Individuals with PKS show a characteristic facial phenotype with frontal bossing, alopecia, sparse eyebrows, depressed nasal bridge, long philtrum, telecanthus, and posteriorly rotated ears. Oro-dental features, such as ""Pallister lip,"" macroglossia, delayed eruption of primary teeth, high arched-palate, prognathism, and cleft palate have been occasionally reported in the medical literature. The aim of the study was to assess the oro-dental phenotype of PKS and to describe the oral health status in a cohort participating in the First European Workshop on PKS. A clinical dental examination was performed in 21 Caucasian probands and data regarding medical and dental history collected. Twelve probands (57%) showed an atypical dental pattern, with multiple missing teeth (primarily the first permanent molars) and 2 (10%) a double teeth. The severity of gingivitis and dental caries increased with age and gingival overgrowth was a common finding. A characteristic occlusive phenotype was found: a high-arched palate with mandibular prognathism associated with an anterior openbite and crossbite and with posterior crossbite (unilateral or bilateral). The prevalence of oral habits (non-nutritive sucking, mouth breathing, bruxism) was high, even in older probands. This study suggests that individuals affected by PKS should be observed closely for oro-dental diseases and a multidisciplinary approach is needed to implement the right preventive measures. ?? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
6,Skeletal Indicators of Stress: A Component of the Biocultural Profile of Undocumented Migrants in Southern Arizona.,"The ability of forensic anthropologists in the United States to distinguish the remains of foreign nationals from those of American citizens may be crucial to the identification process. This study adds new criteria for identifying Hispanic foreign nationals in southern Arizona to those previously outlined by Birkby et al. (J Forensic Sci 53, 2008, 29) in the ""cultural profile."" Skeletal indicators of nonspecific stress were evaluated in undocumented border crossers (UBCs) at the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner and in documented American samples. Odds ratios show significant associations between UBC status and the presence of porotic hyperostosis and enamel hypoplasias, which are, respectively, 7.9 and 3 times more prevalent among UBCs. These findings are consistent with disparities in access to adequate nutrition and health care during childhood. In conjunction with context and other biocultural factors, the presence of these conditions should prompt practitioners to consider that unidentified remains may represent foreign nationals."
6,[The Common Risk Factor Approach - An Integrated Population- and Evidence-Based Approach for Reducing Social Inequalities in Oral Health].,"Worldwide, non-communicable diseases including dental caries and periodontal diseases, remain a major public health problem. Moreover, there is a social gradient in health across society that runs from the top to the bottom in a linear, stepwise fashion. Health promoting behaviours become more difficult to sustain further down the social ladder. Oral health inequalities also exist in Germany. Earlier explanations of social inequalities have mainly focused on individual lifestyle factors, ignoring the broader social determinants of health and disease. Until recently, the dominant approaches to general health promotion focused on actions to reduce specific diseases, separating oral health from general health. An alternative approach is the common risk factor approach (CRFA) where risk factors common to a number of major chronic diseases, including diseases of the mouth and teeth, are tackled. The CRFA focuses on the common underlying determinants of health to improve the overall health of populations, thereby reducing social inequalities. The main implication of the CRFA for oral health policies is to work in partnership with a range of other sectors and disciplines. Oral health issues need to be integrated with recommendations to promote general health. Improvements in oral health and a reduction in oral health inequalities are more likely by working in partnership across sectors and disciplines using strategies that focus upstream on the underlying determinants of oral diseases."
6,Oral and dental diseases in a population of domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo).,"Domestic ferrets have been used for many purposes, but recently their popularity as companion animals has increased greatly. However, data on their oral and dental diseases are rare. The objective of this study was therefore to describe oral and dental diseases in a population of client-owned domestic ferrets.In this cross-sectional clinical study, detailed oral and dental examination and full-mouth dental radiographs were performed in 57 client-owned ferrets.Variations in occlusion and number of roots per tooth were noted in comparison with previously published literature on ferrets. Periodontal disease, attrition/abrasion and dental fractures, especially of the canine teeth, were commonly observed. Periapical disease associated with dental fractures, malocclusion, tooth resorption and neoplasia was uncommon.This study indicates that thorough oral and dental examination supported by dental radiography under general anaesthesia should be performed in domestic ferrets as a part of regular veterinary care."
6,The emergency department as a 'last resort': why parents seek care for their child's nontraumatic dental problems in the emergency room.,"Over the last two decades, there has been an increasing trend in the number of families using emergency departments (EDs) for treating their children's nontraumatic dental problems. We do not know why families use the ED in this way; to date, little research has addressed parents' decisions. The purpose of this study was to explore the reasons that lead parents to select the ED over a dental clinic for their child's nontraumatic dental problem.Using a qualitative descriptive design, we conducted semi-structured interviews with parents of children under age 10 who sought care for nontraumatic dental problems in an ED of a pediatric hospital. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded for thematic analysis using Grembowski's dental care process model as a sensitizing construct.Fifteen parents were recruited (ten mothers and five fathers). Three salient themes were identified: (i) parental beliefs and socioeconomic challenges which contributed to their care seeking, (ii) barriers parents faced in finding oral healthcare options for their children in their communities (e.g., poor access to care and poor quality of care), and (iii) parent's high satisfaction with the care provided through the ED.The ED was families' last resort; parents took their child to the ED because of the lack of other options in their communities rather than a belief that the ED was the best choice for dental care. The current pattern of ED use resulted in stress for these parents and repercussions for the children (e.g., pain, longer waiting, and increased complications); further, it has been shown in the literature to be an economic strain on the health system."
6,Monolateral sinonasal complications of dental disease or treatment: when does endoscopic endonasal surgery require an intraoral approach?,"The widespread use of dental implants and reconstructive procedures for their positioning has led to an increase in sinonasal complications of dental disease and treatment (SCDDT). Diagnosis requires accurate dental and rhinological evaluation, including computed tomography (CT). The aim of this study is to investigate a multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of SCDDT by combining endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) and an intraoral approach on the basis of a preliminary classification system already proposed by other authors. Moreover, we analysed the percentage of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis extending to the anterior ethmoidal sinuses and bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of SCDDT. Between January 2012 and August 2015, in our series of 31 patients, 16/31 patients (51.6%) were treated with EES, 3/31 patients (9.7%) with an intraoral approach and 12/31 patients (38.7%) with a combined approach. All patients reported improvement in sinusitis symptoms confirmed by clinical examinations and CT scan. No significant complications were recorded and revision surgery was not required. Finally, the results of this preliminary study suggest that a multidisciplinary approach to SCDDT from diagnosis to therapy allows more precise diagnosis and comprehensive therapy to achieve a rapid recovery and minimise the risk of recurrence."

6,Empiric systemic antibiotics for hospitalized patients with severe odontogenic infections.,"Odontogenic infections may lead to severe head and neck infections with potentially great health risk. Age, location of purulent affected sites and beta-lactam allergy are some mentionable factors regarding patients' in-hospital stay and course of disease. Are there new challenges regarding bacteria' antibiotic resistance for empiric treatment and what influences do they have on patients' clinical course?We analyzed in a 4-year retrospective study the medical records of 294 in-hospital patients with severe odontogenic infections. On a routine base bacteria were identified and susceptibility testing was performed. Length of stay in-hospital was evaluated regarding patients' age, beta-lactam allergy profile, affected sites and bacteria susceptibility to empiric antibiotics.Length of stay in-hospital was detected to be associated with affected space and penicillin allergy as well (p??<??0.05). Isolates presented large amounts of aerobic gram-positive bacteria (64.2%), followed by facultative anaerobic bacteria (gram+/15.8%, gram-/12.7%). Tested ampicillin in combination with sulbactam (or without) and cephalosporins displayed high susceptibility rates, revealing distinguished results regarding clindamycin (p??<??0.05). Co-trimoxazol and moxifloxacin showed high overall susceptibility rates (MOX: 94.7%, COTRIM: 92.6%).This study demonstrates ampicillin/sulbactam in addition to surgical intervention is a good standard in treatment of severe odontogenic neck infections. Cephalosporins seem to be a considerable option as well. If beta-lactam allergy is diagnosed co-trimoxazol and moxifloxacin represent relevant alternatives.Age, allergic profile and bacteria' resistance patterns for empiric antibiotics have an influence on patients in-hospital stay. Ampicillin/sulbactam proves itself to be good for empiric antibiosis in severe odontogenic infections. Furthermore cephalosporins could be considered as another option in treatment. However moxifloxacin and co-trimoxazol deserves further investigation as empiric antibiosis in odontogenic infections if beta-lactam allergy is diagnosed."
6,Oral and craniofacial manifestations of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome: Case series.,"The objective of this case series was to determine the oral, dental and craniofacial features of patients with EvC syndrome.Eight patients with EvC syndrome were enrolled. A complete family history, pedigree analysis, detailed medical history were collected. Findings of clinical examination, including craniofacial and orodental manifestations, and radiological investigations were thoroughly studied.All eight patients had characteristic face, hypertrophic frenulum, conical and peg-shaped teeth, hypodontia of deciduous and/or permanent teeth and also skeletal dysplasia, small chest, short stature and hypoplastic nails. Additionally dysmorphic filtrum, serrated appearance of gingiva, diastema, enamel hypoplasia, microdontia, taurodontism, single rooted permanent molar, delayed eruption and high caries rate were observed with varying degrees. Cephalometric evaluation revealed skeletal Class III growth pattern in four subjects and Class II growth pattern in one subject.Evaluation of craniofacial and orodental anomalies of EvC syndrome is required for accurate differential diagnosis from other congenital syndromes."
6,Sleep bruxism. Conceptual review and update.,"Sleep bruxism (SB) is a parafunctional oromotor habit that can sometimes pose a threat to the integrity of the structures of the masticatory system if the magnitude and direction of the forces exerted exceed the system 's adaptive capacity. Over the years science has tried to provide a consistent explanation of the etiopathogenesis and physiopathology of SB, although the pathophysiological mechanisms are even now not yet fully understood. There is at present no specific, effective treatment to eliminate the habit of bruxism permanently. There are only palliative therapeutic alternatives steered at preventing the pathological effects of SB on the stomatognathic system and alleviating the negative clinical consequences of the habit. The objective of this article is to review and update the fundamental scientific concepts of SB and to furnish an approach to the main types of therapy used, based on the scientific literature."
6,[Masticatory apparatus disorder: how can rehabilitation treatment help?],"The temporomandibular joint is highly adaptive and masticatory apparatus disorders (MAD) can occur when its ability to adapt is overwhelmed. Occlusal etiologies were long pinpointed as the sole culprits. However, a consensus now exists which minimizes their involvement. It is recognized that the etiology of MAD is multifactorial, combining occlusal problems, parafunctions, postural anomalies, orofacial dyspraxia and stress.In this article, the authors review the role of physiotherapy in managing these pathologies.While it remains essential to treat the symptoms in order to relieve pain, optimum treatment requires the underlying pathogenic mechanisms to be identified. Rehabilitation treatment, therefore, offers a physiotherapy-based approach providing an etiological solution. By reeducating function, physiotherapy produces lasting results.Given the multifactorial nature of MAD etiologies, maxillofacial rehabilitation is an indispensible ally for odontologists or orthodontists adopting a multidisciplinary approach in their treatment of this disorder."
6,Molecular Changes Involving MEK3-p38 MAPK Activation in Chronic Masticatory Myalgia.,"The exact mechanism underlying chronic masticatory myalgia (CMM), a conspicuous symptom in temporomandibular disorders, remains unclear. This investigation compared gene expression profiles between CMM patients and healthy subjects. Peripheral blood leukocytes were collected in 8 cases and 8 controls and subjected to whole genome microarray analyses. Data were analyzed with Gene Ontology and interactive pathways analyses. According to Gene Ontology analysis, categories such as ion transport, response to stimuli, and metabolic process were upregulated. The pathway analysis suggested overexpression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in CMM patients and to a higher degree in a pathway network. Overexpression of representative members of the MAPK pathway-including MAPK kinase 3 (MEK3), calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma 2 (CACNG2), and growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gamma (GADD45G)-was validated with real-time polymerase chain reaction. The upregulation of MEK3 was negatively correlated with the age of the CMM group. In the next step, the authors focused on MEK3, the gene that exhibited the greatest degree of differential expression, and its downstream target protein p38 MAPK. The results revealed upregulation of MEK3, as well as phosphorylated MEK3 and phosphorylated p38 MAPK, in CMM patients. These results provide a ""fingerprint"" for mechanistic studies of CMM in the future and highlight the importance of MEK3-p38 MAPK activation in CMM."
6,Osteonecrosis of the jaw.,"This review looks at osteonecrosis in the stomatognathic system (mainly the jaws). Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a rare but serious clinical condition. It affects patients treated with bisphosphonates, and also with denosumab, mainly in oncological doses. In osteoporosis, it is a problem of relatively small significance. Article presents a thorough review of this phenomenon, including its definition, pathogenesis, risk factors, prevention and treatment methods, and its incidence rate."
6,Current management of upper respiratory tract and head and neck infections.,"The objective of this study is to present the antimicrobial management modalities of treating upper respiratory tract (URT) and head and neck infections. This article discusses the current antimicrobial treatment strategies of URT and head and neck infections. The increasing antimicrobial resistance of many bacterial pathogens has made the treatment of URT and head and neck infections more difficult. This review summarizes the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology and antimicrobials therapy of acute and chronic URT and head and neck infections. These infections include dental (gingivitis, periodontitis, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, and periodontal abscess), acute and chronic otitis media, mastoiditis and sinusitis, pharyngo-tonsillitis, peritonsillar, retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses, suppurative thyroiditis, cervical lymphadenitis, parotitis, siliadenitis, and deep neck infections including Lemierre syndrome. In conclusion, the proper management of these infections requires an accurate clinical and bacteriological diagnosis."
6,"Physical illness in patients with severe mental disorders. I. Prevalence, impact of medications and disparities in health care.","The lifespan of people with severe mental illness (SMI) is shorter compared to the general population. This excess mortality is mainly due to physical illness. We report prevalence rates of different physical illnesses as well as important individual lifestyle choices, side effects of psychotropic treatment and disparities in health care access, utilization and provision that contribute to these poor physical health outcomes. We searched MEDLINE (1966 - August 2010) combining the MeSH terms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder with the different MeSH terms of general physical disease categories to select pertinent reviews and additional relevant studies through cross-referencing to identify prevalence figures and factors contributing to the excess morbidity and mortality rates. Nutritional and metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, viral diseases, respiratory tract diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, sexual dysfunction, pregnancy complications, stomatognathic diseases, and possibly obesity-related cancers are, compared to the general population, more prevalent among people with SMI. It seems that lifestyle as well as treatment specific factors account for much of the increased risk for most of these physical diseases. Moreover, there is sufficient evidence that people with SMI are less likely to receive standard levels of care for most of these diseases. Lifestyle factors, relatively easy to measure, are barely considered for screening; baseline testing of numerous important physical parameters is insufficiently performed. Besides modifiable lifestyle factors and side effects of psychotropic medications, access to and quality of health care remains to be improved for individuals with SMI."
6,Trends in dental-related use of hospital emergency departments in Florida.,"The inability to access regular dental care may lead to care seeking at hospital emergency departments (EDs). However, EDs generally are not equipped or staffed to provide definitive dental services. This study examined trends and patterns of hospital ED use for dental-related reasons in Florida, a large, diverse state with serious barriers to accessing dental care.Data for this study were drawn from ambulatory ED discharge records compiled by Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration for 2005-2014. Visits for dental-related reasons in Florida were defined by the patient's reported reason for seeking care or the ED physician's primary diagnosis using ICD-9-CM codes. We calculated frequencies, age-specific and age-adjusted rates per 100,000 population, and secular trends in dental-related ED visits and their associated charges.The number of dental-related visits to Florida EDs increased each year, from 104,642 in 2005 to 163,900 in 2014; the age-adjusted rate increased by 43.6 percent. Total charges for dental-related ED visits in Florida increased more than threefold during this time period, from $47.7 million in 2005 to $193.4 million in 2014 (adjusted for inflation). The primary payers for dental-related ED visits in 2014 were Medicaid (38 percent), self-pay (38 percent), commercial insurance (11 percent), Medicare (8 percent), and other (5 percent).Dental-related visits to hospital EDs in Florida have increased substantially during the past decade, as have their associated charges. Most patients did not receive definitive oral health care in EDs, and this trend represents an increasingly inefficient use of health care system resources."
6,An overview of osteoporosis for the practising prosthodontist.,"Osteoporosis is an insidious and common bone disorder of the modern age, as a result of the rapidly increasing number of older people in the total population. It has long been concluded that this disease has definite deleterious effects on the stomatognathic system and is therefore of major concern to a Prosthodontist. If features on a dental radiograph, which are the most commonly required radiographs, can be detected regularly and consistently, it would place a prosthodontist in a position to refer the patient for timely management and also modify his treatment plan, greatly improving the prognosis. Available literature was therefore reviewed for pathophysiology, dental radiographic screening measures, implications and management of osteoporosis from the perspective of a prosthodontist."
6,Dental manifestations of dermatologic conditions.,"Cutaneous disorders can be associated with a wide variety of dental manifestations that should be familiar to dermatologists.We sought to describe the development of the teeth, explain current dental terms, and review the dental manifestations of some dermatologic conditions.A MEDLINE search (1966-May 2007) was performed to find relevant articles pertaining to dental manifestations of dermatologic conditions.Dental manifestations are associated with a wide variety of skin diseases that include genetic, infectious, inflammatory, and immune disorders.The review is broad and focuses on commonly described manifestations.An appreciation and understanding of dental signs can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of many skin conditions."
6,Directed Acyclic Graphs for Oral Disease Research.,"Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are nonparametric graphical tools used to depict causal relations in the epidemiologic assessment of exposure-outcome associations. Although their use in dental research was first advocated in 2002, DAGs have yet to be widely adopted in this field. DAGs help identify threats to causal inference such as confounders, bias due to subject selection, and inappropriate handling of missing data. DAGs can also inform the data analysis strategy based on relations among variables depicted on it. This article uses the example of a study of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), investigating causal effects of facial injury on subsequent risk of TMD. We illustrate how DAGs can be used to identify 1) potential confounders, 2) mediators and the consequences of attempt to estimate direct causal effects, 3) colliders and the consequences of conditioning on colliders, and 4) variables that are simultaneously mediators and confounders and the consequences of adjustment for such variables. For example, one DAG shows that statistical adjustment for the pressure pain threshold would necessarily bias the causal relation between facial injury and TMD. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of DAGs during study design, subject selection, and choosing variables to be measured in a study."
6,Clinical and surgical management of an aggressive cherubism treated with autogenous bone graft and calcitonin.,"Cherubism is a rare autosomal-dominant inherited syndrome and is usually self-limiting; it starts in early childhood and involutes by puberty. It is a benign fibroosseous disease, characterized by excessive bone degradation of the upper and lower jaws followed by development of fibrous tissue masses. The purpose of this clinical report is to describe a rare and aggressive form of cherubism on an adult female patient that has been treated in our Bioscience Center for Special Health Care Needs-CEBAPE. The patient was firstly submitted to the surgical procedure with partial curettage of the lesion, and the cavity was filled with autogenous cancellous bone and bone marrow grafts. Furthermore, the support treatment used was the administration of salmon calcitonin by nasal spray during the first year after the preconized procedure. At 4-year followup, we confirmed the stomatognathic system improvement and esthetic rehabilitation, which led to a significant increase in the patient's quality of life."
6,Prevalence of malocclusions in the 13-20-year-old categories of football athletes.,"The dentist can offer athletes improvement in their physical performance through the maintenance of oral health, preventing and treating any and all changes in the stomatognathic system, such as dental malocclusions, that compromise the athletes' performance. The objective of this study is to research the presence of dental malocclusions in athletes of the category between 13 and 20 years of age, from the S??o Paulo Football Club. 84 athletes participated in this study, dealing with the following topics: molar relation (Angle's classification); presence of overbite; underbite; overcrowding; abnormal spacing; open bite; and anterior, posterior, bilateral and unilateral crossbite; midline deviation and facial type (mesofacial, brachyfacial and dolichofacial). Only one table was made, showing percentages. In regard to Angle's molar relation, 89% are in Class I, 8% in Class II, 3% Class III, 9% of the athletes had overbite, 4% had underbite, 13% had overcrowding and 21% had abnormal spacing. In regard to the bite, 11% presented anterior open bite. In regard to crossbite, 7% presented unilateral crossbite on the right side and 2% on the left side; 5% presented posterior crossbite and 4% anterior crossbite. In regard to midline deviations, 4% presented deviation in the maxilla and 33% in the mandible. In regard to facial type: 39% are dolichofacial, 4% brachyfacial and 57% mesofacial. Based on the results shown, proposals for the implementation of dental, phoniatric, and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) practices are already being discussed with the multidisciplinary team of the club involved."
6,Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Patients Receiving Bone-Targeted Therapies: An Overview--Part I.,"Urologic patients receiving bone-targeted therapies are at risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). ONJ has historically been associated with bisphosphonate therapy. More recently, RANK-Ligand inhibitors (denosumab) have also been used to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events in patients who have advanced cancers with bone metastases. More than 65% of men with metastatic prostate cancer and nearly 75% of women with metastatic breast cancer are affected by bone metastases. The literature has described ONJ associated with bisphosphonate therapy as bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). However, with evidence also linking the use of RANK-Ligand inhibitors with osteonecrosis of the jaw, we advocate use of the term ""anti-bone resorption therapy-related osteonecrosis of the jaw"" (ABRT-ONJ). The term ""medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw"" (MRONJ) is now becoming more widespread. There is not a universally accepted definition of ABRT-ONJ, which may have hindered recognition and reporting of the condition. In Part I of this article, a review of current knowledge around the etiology of ABRT-ONJ and incidence data are provided. In Part II, we provide an audit of ONJ in a nurse consultant-led bone support clinic. In the article, we refer to zoledronic acid because this is the bisphosphonate of choice for use in men with prostate cancer in the United Kingdom."
6,Postural alterations and pulmonary function of mouth-breathing children.,"Mouth-breathing children have changes in their stomatognathic system, which result in head projection, stress increase in the scapular belt muscles and postural adaptations. Although thoracic shape and posture can influence ventilatory dynamics, we didn't find studies addressing pulmonary function of mouth-breathing children.this study aimed at analyzing the posture of mouth-breathing children, and studying the existence of correlations between posture and pulmonary volumes.prospective, observational and cross-sectional study, where the posture and pulmonary function of 17 mouth-breathing children and of 17 nasal-breathing children were evaluated by means of photogrammetry and forced spirometry.when compared to nasal-breathing, mouth-breathing subjects presented an increment in head projection and cervical lordosis, forwarded gravity center and reduced pulmonary volumes. There was an association between head projection and forced vital capacity, and between postural alterations and age.mouth-breathing children have postural alterations which increases with age and also reduced spirometry values. The vital capacity reduction correlates negatively with head projection."
6,Travel distances by Wisconsin Medicaid enrollees who visit emergency departments for dental care.,"Prior studies document increased numbers of nontraumatic dental condition (NTDC) visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs). However, the influence of travel distance on ED use for NTDCs, particularly for Medicaid enrollees has hitherto received little attention. The authors examined the effect of travel distance on Wisconsin Medicaid enrollees' NTDC visits to EDs after adjustment for covariates.NTDC-related visits claims data for Wisconsin Medicaid (2001-2009) was analyzed. For each enrollee, travel distance to the nearest of 130 EDs in Wisconsin was determined. The number of NTDC visits per person-year was aggregated by ZIP+4 of residence. Negative binomial regression adjusting for the expected number of visits based on race, sex, age of the residents and calendar year was used to evaluate the effect of travel distance, urbanicity, and dentist-population ratio on rate of visits.Enrollees residing in rural counties, entire dental health professional shortage areas, areas with dentist population ratios >20,000: 1 and non-Hispanic Whites travelled the furthest, compared to nearest mean ED distance of 2.9 miles. Enrollees residing 3 miles away or further had significantly lower rates of NTDC visits to EDs.This study demonstrates that distance is a barrier to making NTDC-related visits to EDs. Rates of NTDC visits decreased as travel distance to the nearest ED increased for Medicaid enrollees."
6,"Aphthous, celiac disease and other dental disorders in childhood.","Oral conditions and dental disorders are frequent in childhood. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common inflammatory condition characterized by painful recurrent, single or multiple ulcerations of the oral mucosa induced by genetic and environmental factors. Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic small intestinal immunemediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals pathogenetically related to oral condition. The aim of the study was to evaluate the different prevalence of oral conditions in CD patients compared to a control group.From January 2013 to June 2013, 166 patients, between 2 and 17 years of age and of both genders, were examined in order to evaluate the presence and the medical history of oral conditions. Clinical features of patients affected by CD were compared with those of a control group with similar socio-demographic features.We found that the more common lesions in both groups were RAS (69% in CD patients vs. 43% in the control group), followed by dental disorders (76% in CD patients vs. 65% in the control group). Prevalence of RAS between the two groups was significantly different (P<0.0006). Prevalences of caries and dental abnormalities were the same in the two groups (45% vs. 45% and 16% vs. 16% respectively).In celiac patients there was a significant higher prevalence of RAS compared to a control group. These findings could be possibly associated with common pathogenetic mechanisms."
6,Functional consequences of extreme morphologies in the craniate trophic system.,"Extreme morphologies are often associated with extreme demands on performance in a given ecological setting. Even though such extreme morphologies are relatively rare, the craniate trophic system provides many examples of this evolutionary trend despite its highly integrated nature and intrinsic complexity. In this article, as an introduction to the special issue on functional consequences of extreme adaptations of the trophic apparatus in craniates, we survey case studies highlighting the occurrence of extreme morphologies in the trophic system in craniates and briefly review a number of associated conceptual issues: (1) Are extreme morphologies associated with constrained functional versatility? (2) Do high-performance systems necessarily involve extreme morphological adaptations? and (3) Do extreme morphologies limit functional and ecological capacities? An overview of the case studies presented here shows that the craniate trophic system is a suitable model system to explore the evolution of extreme morphologies but currently provides no clear-cut answers to conceptual issues addressed."
6,Methods for increasing upper airway muscle tonus in treating obstructive sleep apnea: systematic review.,"Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using methods for increasing upper airway muscle tonus has been controversial and poorly reported. Thus, a review of the evidence is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.The design used was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.Data sources are from the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase and Scielo, registries of ongoing trials, theses indexed at Biblioteca Regional de Medicina/Pan-American Health Organization of the World Health Organization and the reference lists of all the trials retrieved.This was a review of randomized or quasi-randomized double-blind trials on OSA. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria. One reviewer assessed study quality and extracted data, and these processes were checked by a second reviewer. The primary outcome was a decrease in the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of below five episodes per hour. Other outcomes were subjective sleep quality, sleep quality measured by night polysomnography, quality of life measured subjectively and adverse events associated with the treatments.Three eligible trials were included. Two studies showed improvements through the objective and subjective analyses, and one study showed improvement of snoring, but not of AHI while the subjective analyses showed no improvement. The adverse events were reported and they were not significant.There is no accepted scientific evidence that methods aiming to increase muscle tonus of the stomatognathic system are effective in reducing AHI to below five events per hour. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy of such methods."
6,The contribution of orthodontics to the prosthodontic treatment of ectodermal dysplasia: a long-term clinical report.,"The long-term management of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) from prepuberty to adulthood often necessitates orthodontic and orthopedic treatment in conjunction with prosthodontic care.The authors present a report regarding the combined orthodontic and prosthodontic treatment of a child with HED-associated oligodontia from the ages of 10 to 18 years. The authors fabricated successive maxillary removable partial dentures, equipped with midline jackscrews, at different phases of the treatment and planned treatment to close the patient's midline diastema. After completion of the orthodontic therapy, three-dimensional analysis of the final dental casts showed a measurable increase in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary dental arch, and posttreatment cephalometric analysis revealed the face to have normal vertical dimensions and a mild retroposition of the maxilla.andOrthodontic and orthopedic treatment in coordination with prosthetic restoration at the appropriate time may benefit the stomatognathic function, normal growth, esthetics and emotional well-being of young people with HED."
6,Expanded protocol of orofacial myofunctional evaluation with scores: Validity and reliability.,"Clinical evaluation of the stomatognathic system is indispensable for the diagnosis of orofacial myofunctional disorders. In order to obtain a more precise diagnosis, the protocol of orofacial myofunctional evaluation with scores (OMES protocol) (Int. J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. 72 (2008) 367-375) was expanded in terms of number of items and scale amplitude. The proposal of this study is to describe the expanded OMES protocol (OMES-E) for the evaluation of children. Validity of the protocol, reliability of the examiners and agreement between them were analyzed, as also were the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the instrument.The sample consisted of videorecorded images of 50 children, 25 boys (mean age=8.4 years, SD=1.8) and 25 girls (mean age=8.2 years, SD=1.7) selected at random from 200 samples. Three speech therapists prepared for orofacial myofunctional evaluation participated as examiners (E). The OMES and OMES-E protocols were used for evaluation on different days. E1 evaluated all images, E2 analyzed children with recordings from 1 to 25 and E3 analyzed children with recordings from 26 to 50. The validity of OMES-E was analyzed by comparing the instrument to the OMES protocol using the Pearson correlation test complemented with the split-half reliability test (p<0.05). The linear weighted Kappa coefficient of agreement (Kw'), the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values and the prevalence of OMD were calculated.There was a statistically significant correlation between the OMES and OMES-E protocols (0.79>r<0.94, p<0.01) and a significant test-retest correlation with the OMES-E (0.75>r<0.86, p<0.01), with a reliability range of 0.86-0.93. The correlation and reliability coefficients between examiners were: E1??E2 (r=0.74, 0.84), E1??E3 (r=0.70, 0.83) (p<0.01). Kw' coefficients with moderate and good strength predominated. The OMES-E protocol presented mean sensitivity=0.91, specificity=0.77, positive predictive value=0.87 and negative predictive value=0.85. The mean prevalence of OMD was 0.58.The OMES-E protocol is valid and reliable for orofacial myofunctional evaluation."
6,[Focus on the occlusal failure].,"The success is evidenced by the longevity of aesthetic and functional therapeutic result. The occlusal ??postorthodontic?? failure could result in dental instability, functional discomfort, dental or musculo-articular complaint. Analysis of the occlusion research potential occlusal pathogenic dysfunction listed in stabilizing (shimming), centering and guiding anomalies. The large capacity of tolerance of the masticatory system makes it difficult to define the border between physiology and pathology but it is necessary to have benchmarks that can be summarized as follows: - shimming: occlusal contact of mesio-lingual cusp of the first maxillary molars (in Class I, II or III) and occlusal contacts between the canines antagonists; - centering: no transversal deflected occlusion between maximal Intercuspation (ICP) and occlusion in Centric Relation (RCP); - guiding: absence of posterior interference, absence of anterior interference (locking).

6,The healthcare system and provision of oral healthcare in European Union member states. Part 4: Greece.,"This paper presents a description of the healthcare system and how oral healthcare is organised and provided in Greece, a country in a deep economic and social crisis. The national health system is underfunded, with severe gaps in staffing levels and the country has a large private healthcare sector. Oral healthcare has been largely provided in the private sector. Most people are struggling to survive and have no money to spend on general and oral healthcare. Unemployment is rising and access to healthcare services is more difficult than ever. Additionally, there has been an overproduction of dentists and no development of team dentistry. This has led to under or unemployment of dentists in Greece and their migration to other European Union member states, such as the United Kingdom, where over 600 Greek dentists are currently working."
6,Types of taste circuits synaptically linked to a few geniculate ganglion neurons.,"The present study evaluates the central circuits that are synaptically engaged by very small subsets of the total population of geniculate ganglion cells to test the hypothesis that taste ganglion cells are heterogeneous in terms of their central connections. We used transsynaptic anterograde pseudorabies virus labeling of fungiform taste papillae to infect single or small numbers of geniculate ganglion cells, together with the central neurons with which they connect, to define differential patterns of synaptically linked neurons in the taste pathway. Labeled brain cells were localized within known gustatory regions, including the rostral central subdivision (RC) of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST), the principal site where geniculate axons synapse, and the site containing most of the cells that project to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) of the pons. Cells were also located in the rostral lateral NST subdivision (RL), a site of trigeminal and sparse geniculate input, and the ventral NST (V) and medullary reticular formation (RF), a caudal brainstem pathway leading to reflexive oromotor functions. Comparisons among cases, each with a random, very small subset of labeled geniculate neurons, revealed ""types"" of central neural circuits consistent with a differential engagement of either the ascending or the local, intramedullary pathway by different classes of ganglion cells. We conclude that taste ganglion cells are heterogeneous in terms of their central connectivity, some engaging, predominantly, the ascending ""lemniscal,"" taste pathway, a circuit associated with higher order discriminative and homeostatic functions, others engaging the ""local,"" intramedullary ""reflex"" circuit that mediates ingestion and rejection oromotor behaviors."
6,Frequency analysis of snoring sounds during simulated and nocturnal snoring.,"Despite several ways of investigation, such as clinical examination, drug-induced sleep endoscopy and pressure measurement of the upper airway, it is still difficult to locate the site of snoring exactly. Frequency analysis of snoring sounds is described as a promising diagnostic tool. The aim of the study was to examine simulated snoring under conditions awake, record the produced snoring sounds and compare those sounds with nocturnal snoring. A total of 50 snoring male patients were examined clinically by flexible nasal endoscopy and simulated snoring under conditions awake, and the simulated snoring sounds were recorded. Additionally, nocturnal snoring sounds were recorded during nighttime polysomnography. Snoring events were analyzed by fast-fourier-transformation and the intensity peaks 1-5 were evaluated. Rhythmic and non-rhythmic snoring events were distinguished depending on present obstructive apneas. Clinical and polysomnographical data were correlated with the results of the frequency analysis of the snoring sounds. Simulated snoring sounds revealed a low frequency of 200 Hz in intensity peaks 1 and 2 with an increase up to 3,000 Hz in peaks 3-5. Similar frequency patterns were detected in rhythmic nocturnal snoring. Non-rhythmic snoring events revealed frequency patterns between 2,000 and 3,000 Hz in all five intensity peaks. Simulated snoring resembles rhythmic nocturnal snoring with low-frequency intensity peaks, whereas non-rhythmic snoring revealed high frequencies. The examination during simulated snoring and frequency analysis of snoring sounds might contribute in locating the pathogenesis of snoring."
6,Descending necrotizing mediastinitis. Diagnosis and surgical treatment.,"Descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM) is an unusual and severe disease with a high mortality rate. Surgical management remains controversial. Our investigations reviews the most effective surgical treatment in the management of this rare pathology.Seven patients with DNM and treated over a 20-year period are reported. All patients were evaluated according to the classification suggested by Endo et al. of the degree of mediastinal diffusion, based on CT scan findings. Five patients underwent combined cervical drainage and thoracotomy, 2 patients were treated with cervical drainage alone.The outcome was favorable in 5 patients, 4 treated with a combined cervical and thoracic approach and 1 with a cervical approach alone. Two patients that underwent a combinated cervical and thoracic approach alone, died of septic shock. Overall mortality rate was 28.5%.Early diagnosis and early, aggressive surgical treatment are required to improve the poor prognosis of DNM. Although a unique surgical management is still not completely accepted, we state, in agreement with other authors, a wide approach consisting of a cervical drainage and mediastinotomy in case of upper mediastinitis and a combined cervical and thoracic approach in case of lower mediastinitis. In the course of thoracotomy a wide excision of necrotic and particularly fat mediastinal tissue is needed, to avoid a recurrent infection. A continuous cervico-mediastinal irrigation system is suggested during the postoperative period."
6,[Correlations between occlusal dysfunctions and temporomandibular joint disorders].,"The occlusal problems and the temporomandibular disorders are the most frequent aspects which we often find to the patients with the dysfunctional syndrome of the stomatognathic system. This study tries to establish the correlation between these two kinds of dysfunctions and to find (if it exists) a direct proportional relation between them. For this purpose we studied 8 cases who had been diagnosed as having the dysfunctional syndrome of the stomatognathic system on the base of the clinical symptoms, tomographs and CT. The results of the study proved that an occlusal dysfunction can affect the temporomandibular joint and vice versa, because all the component parts of the stomatognathic system are in a close relationship and they influence each other, but these results didn't indicate a direct proportional relation between these two kinds of dysfunctions."
6,[A preliminary study on the occlusal contact changes during retention in adolescent patients].,"To evaluate the changes of the occlusal contact characteristics in adolescent patients during 12 months after active orthodontic treatment.Twenty adolescent patients with Hawley retainers after active orthodontic treatment were divided into none occlusal interference group and occlusal interference group. The occlusion of the patients was examined with T-Scan II system directly after the appliance removal (T1) and after an average retention period of 12 months (T2). The changes of occlusal contact characteristics were observed.The disclusion time during protrusion, left and right lateral movements reduced significantly. The average disclusion time decreased [from (1.07 ?? 0.87), (0.91 ?? 0.47), (0.76 ?? 0.43) s to (0.43 ?? 0.25), (0.67 ?? 0.41), (0.50 ?? 0.27) s] significantly (P < 0.05). The occlusal interference disappeared in 4 patients and 1 patient with occlusal interference showed masticatory muscle symptom. The dynamic occlusion [from (1.25 ?? 1.11), (0.84 ?? 0.15), (0.52 ?? 0.49) s to (0.35 ?? 0.15), (0.36 ?? 0.15), (0.33 ?? 0.11) s] improved significantly (P < 0.05) in none occlusal interference group after retention and no statistical differences were found in the occlusal interference group (P > 0.05).The overall dynamic occlusion improved after retention in patients with retainers. The presence of occlusal interference affected the self-improvement process and increased the chance of the disorders of stomatognathic system, such as mandibular abnormal movements. Therefore, functional occlusion evaluation and final detailing were needed before appliance removal."
6,Service profile of Orthognathic Surgery of a medical school.,"Orthognathic surgeries are very important for both the correction of dentofacial deformities as well as for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. Nowadays, most of the population presents some type of morphological and/or functional disorder of the stomatognathic system.The present study aims at assessing the information from the individuals treated in the Orthognathic Surgical Service of a Medical School.Search in medical records - 2004-2008, identification procedures, individual characteristics, malocclusion and surgery.The number of surgical treatments due to dentofacial deformities has been increasing. Maxillary advancement surgery alone comprised the highest number in the sample.Orthognathic surgery cases have been increasing in the last years and maxillary advancement alone comprised the highest number of surgical treatments."
6,Masseter muscle thickness in hospitalised stroke patients.,"The aim of the study was to investigate the thickness of the masseter muscles in stroke patients when compared to a control group (CG). Hospitalised stroke patients (18 men, 13 women; age 69.0 +/- 12.7 years) were compared to a CG (13 men, 11 women; age 68.8 +/- 10.8 years) composed to correspond to in age, gender and dental state. The thickness of the masseter muscle was recorded by means of a real-time ultrasound scanner on both sides, twice under contraction and twice in relaxed condition. In the stroke patients, the thickness of the masseter muscle of the affected side (aff) was smaller than the one of the non-affected side (non-aff) both, under contraction (aff 13.1 +/- 2.4 mm; non-aff 13.8 +/- 2.3 mm, P </= 0.004) and relaxation (aff 13.1 +/- 2.5 mm; non-aff 13.6 +/- 2.3 mm, P </= 0.05). No consistent side differences were found in the thickness of the masseter muscles in CG (contracted right: 14.1 +/- 3.2 mm, left: 14.2 +/- 3.1 mm and relaxed right: 14.0 +/- 3.2, left: 14.3 +/- 3.2 mm, n.s.). The results suggest an influence of stroke on the stomatognathic system; because in patients with hemispheric stroke, a side difference is established in their oral functions. This asymmetric stimulation of the masticatory muscles may have caused this difference in the masseter muscle bulk."
6,American Indian and Alaska Native Access to Oral Health Care: A Potential Solution.,"American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) experience significant health disparities relative to the general U.S.In particular, oral diseases affect the majority of the AI/AN population and their prevalence is significantly greater than observed in other demographic sectors of the U.S.The reasons for these disparities are multiple but lack of access to dental care is clearly a contributing factor. The dentist-to-population ratio in many AI/AN communities is less than half the U.S. average. A solution has been developed in Alaska by AI/AN leaders: dental therapists, i.e., local people trained for two years to provide basic dental services. This solution is being fought by organized dentistry that sees the approach as an economic threat, but AI/AN organizations are committed to implementing this Native solution to their access problem. The Alaska experience indicates that access to oral health services can be improved through the addition of dental therapists to the dental team."
6,Changes in hyoid position following treatment of Class II division1 malocclusions with a functional appliance.,"The aim of this study was to determine change of hyoid bone position following treatment with functional appliance in patients with class II division 1 malocclusion.This study performed on pre and post treatment lateral cephalograms of 28 patients with class II div I malocclusion treated with Farmand functional appliance on average of 11 months. The range of age of girls was 10-13 years and boys 11-14 years. To study the results, t test and Pearsons correlation coefficient were used.Hyoid bone shifted significantly (P value < 0.01) forward in horizontal dimension and non significantly upward in vertical dimension. There was no significant difference between three groups in facial growth patterns with respect to hyoid bone position alterations in horizontal dimension but was significant between horizontal and vertical growth pattern in vertical dimension. (P value < 0.05). There was significant correlation between decrease ofANB angle with forward movement of hyoid bone.Following treatment with Farmand functional appliance, significant changes occur in the position and anterior displacement of the hyoid bone."
6,Effects of orofacial myofunctional therapy on temporomandibular disorders.,"The objectives of the current study were to analyze the effects of orofacial myofunctional therapy (OMT) on the treatment of subjects with associated articular and muscular temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Thirty subjects with associated articular and muscular TMD, according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD), were randomly divided into groups: 10 were treated with OMT (T group), 10 with an occlusal splint (OS group), and 10 untreated control group with TMD (SC). Ten subjects without TMD represented the asymptomatic group (AC). All subjects had a clinical examination and were interviewed to determine Helkimo's Indexes (Di and Ai), the frequency and severity of signs and symptoms, and orofacial myofunctional evaluation. During the diagnostic phase, there were significant differences between groups T and AC. There were no significant differences between group T and OC and SC groups. During the final phase, groups T and OS presented significant improvement, however, the group T presented better results and differed significantly from group OS regarding the number of subjects classified as Aill; the severity of muscular pain and TMJ pain; the frequency of headache and the muscles and stomatognathic functions. The group T differed significantly from the SC group but no longer differed significantly from the AC group. OMT favored a significant reduction of pain sensitivity to palpation of all muscles studied but not for the TMJs; an increased measure of mandibular range of motion; reduced Helkimo's Di and Ai scores; reduced frequency and severity of signs and symptoms; and increased scores for orofacial myofunctional conditions."
6,[Clinical and preclinical application of PTH and BMP to dental treatment].,"Bone formation is the important factor which contributes to the successful periodontal tissue regeneration in periodontitis and osseointegration of implant placement. To achieve the sufficient bone volume in the process of dental treatment, several growth factors and hormones which enhance bone formation have been evaluated in clinical and preclinical studies. BMP2 and BMP7 have recently been approved for sinus augmentation by FDA. A phase2a randomized controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of GDF5 to stimulate periodontal tissue regeneration and GDF5 significantly stimulated alveolar bone regeneration compared to control. Moreover, increased alveolar bone formation was observed by the use of PTH (1-34) Teriparatide in patients of severe periodontitis. PTH and GDF5 are promising agents for future periodontitis treatment."
6,Correlation between various investigation methods of stomatognatic dysfunction.,"The aim of this communication is to analyze the correlation between the stomatognathic and cervical muscular system testing, the analysis of tomography and the kinesiographic survey. The study has been done on 78 clinically healthy patients (24 males and 54 females) aged between 21 and 71, presenting various forms of stomatognathic system dysfunctions. The anamnesis comprised the Slavicek questionnaire as well. Within the complex clinical examination the classical clinical investigation of the masticatory muscles and the TMJ has been supplemented by masticatory muscles, cervical spine and shoulder girdle tests (AROM, PROM and resistive muscle tests). These tests have been correlated with the results of the 468 tomogram analyses and kinesiography surveys for test movements (780 traces) and for functional movements (156 records). The analysis of tomograms has shown the dimensional asymmetry of the articular elements and the asymmetry of the relationship between these elements in various position. These asymmetries are correlated to the alteration of the kinesiographic tracings. The variations of the articular gap and the P2 and P3 values are correlated in a very interesting way with the kinesiographic record but also with the symptoms of muscular dysfunction. The asymmetric condylar movements are reflected in the asymmetry of the muscular contractions, put into evidence through the insufficient response to AROM (78%), PROM (62%), resistive muscle tests (8%) for the masticatory muscles and cervical spine (22%). These results suggest the opportunity of extending the clinical examination at least in the cervical area."
6,Winter Deployment 14 and 15: an audit of injury and illness rates in an Arctic environment.,"Arduous military training in a cold weather environment is likely to lead to a variety of injuries to the
population at risk (PAR). This paper examines injury rates and medical presentations over the two years of Winter Deployments in 2014 and 2015 (WD14 and WD15) and proposes recommendations for future WDs.Data on injury rates, number of aeromedical evacuations, and number of days of restricted duties allocated were  collected prospectively for all patients presenting to Asegarden Medical Centre, Norway, during WD14 and WD15. The data were calculated as a percentage of the total PAR on each deployment to allow meaningful comparison.During WD14, 22.8% of the PAR presented to the Medical Centre compared to 26.9% during WD15. WD15 saw a reduction in the presentation of musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries, cold weather (CW) injuries and burns. Skin problems and diarrhoea and vomiting (D&V) remained similar in both years. An increase in dental and other presentations was seen in WD15. A reduction in the overall aeromedical evacuations and number of patients requiring a light duties (LD) chit was seen during WD15.WD15 has seen a decrease in injury rates, the number of aeromedical evacuations and LD chits issued. It
is difficult to know whether these changes are a result of improved medical support, training or equipment. The liaison between the command, medical and training elements has led to improvements and should now concentrate on ways to further reduce injury rates whilst maximising arduous training benefits in an Arctic environment."
6,Odontogenic and rhinogenic chronic sinusitis: a modern microbiological comparison.,"Odontogenic sinusitis and sinonasal complications of dental disease or treatment (SCDDT) play a relevant, often underappreciated role in paranasal sinus infections. Treating SCDDT patients requires tailored medical and surgical approaches in order to achieve acceptable success rates. These approaches differ from common rhinogenic sinusitis treatment protocols mostly because of the different etiopathogenesis. Our study comprehensively evaluated microbiology and antibiotic resistance in SCDDT patients and compared findings with a control group of patients affected by rhinogenic sinusitis.We performed microbiological sampling during surgery on 28 patients with SCDDT and 16 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Colonies were isolated, Gram-stained, and the species identified using classic biochemical methods. These results were confirmed by DNA pyrosequencing, and then the resistance profile of each SCDDT isolate to various antibiotics was tested.Microbial growth was observed in all SCDDT patients, whereas samples from 60% of patients in the control group failed to yield any bacterial growth (p < 0.001). Anaerobes grew in 14% of SCDDT patients as compared to 7% of CRSwNP patients (p = 0.42). Of the isolates from SCDDT patients, 70% were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas all isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin. Of the staphylococci identified, 80% were capable of producing beta-lactamase.Given the extent of microbiological contamination within the maxillary sinus of SCDDT patients, these infections should be regarded as a different class of conditions from rhinogenic sinusitis. Our findings support the need for different approaches in the treatment of SCDDT patients."
6,Temporomandibular joint disorder in a patient with multiple sclerosis--review of literature with a clinical report.,"Temporomandibular disorders are a form of musculoskeletal disorders, which reduce the function of stomatognathic system and they are related to some other diseases causing painful conditions and disorders of oral function. The aim of this paper is to describe a one year follow up clinical case of a female patient with comorbid multiple sclerosis and a relatively rare form of articular disc disorder. Primary clinical diagnostics encompassed manual methods of TMJ examination. Definite diagnosis included radiologic examination. Clinical hyperextensive condyle position was palpated bilaterally and subsequently confirmed by a functional panoramic radiograph of TMJ. The anterior displacement of disc with reduction was diagnosed by magnetic resonance and in the right joint there was a disc displacement upon excursive movement. From relevant literature, the relationship of a number of diseases that can be related to functional disorder of the orofacial system, such as multiple sclerosis, has been described from many aspects. Also, apart from the standard classification of one form of anterior displacement of the disc, made primarily by magnetic resonance, cases of disc displacement upon excursive mandibular movement can rarely be found in literature."
6,The healthcare system and the provision of oral healthcare in EU Member States: France.,"The French oral health system is based on the provision of dental treatment and is organised around a fee-per-item model. The system is funded by a complex mix of public and complementary health insurance schemes. The system is successful in that it provides access to affordable dental treatment to the majority of the French population. However, France had the highest health expenditure as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) of all European Union countries in 2008 and rising oral health inequalities may be exacerbated by the manner in which oral health care is provided and funded. In addition, there is no organised national strategy for the prevention of oral diseases or for oral health promotion. "
6,Three-dimensional modeling of an individualized functional masticatory system and bite force analysis with an orthodontic bite plate.,"Orthodontic tooth movement is affected by bite forces generated from the masticatory system. This study aims to study three-dimensional (3D) modeling of the individualized functional masticatory system and explore its application in orthodontics.An individualized masticatory system model containing the craniomaxilla, mandible, 4 pairs of primary masticatory muscles and complete dentition, including roots and precise dental crowns, was developed using 3D images from spiral computed tomography and digital casts. By registering global coordinates and using data transformation, individual movement data for mandibular opening, lateral excursion and protrusion were recorded with an Arcus Digma system and applied to this model to simulate the functional movements of the mandible. Using the finite element method, deformations and displacement of the masticatory muscles were simulated along with the mandibular movements. Under individualized muscle loading, the bite forces of the lower incisors with the orthodontic bite plate were analyzed.Individualized mandibular movements were simulated, and the performance of the masticatory muscles along with the mandibular movements was measured. The bite force generated on the lower incisors with different thicknesses and the orientations of the orthodontic bite plate were acquired.An individualized 3D masticatory system model was constructed using advanced 3D data processing software that integrated 3D images from different sources. Individualized mandibular movement and masticatory muscle performance were simulated using this model. The analysis of the bite force generated on the lower incisors with the orthodontic bite plate suggested that a thickness of 3??mm may be appropriate for clinical use."
6,Epidemiology of rare injuries and conditions among United States high school athletes during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 school years.,"Although more than 7 million athletes participate in high school sports in the United States, to date no nationally representative studies of rare injuries and conditions (RICs) exist. Rare injuries and conditions include eye injuries, dental injuries, neck and cervical injuries, and dehydration and heat illnesses.To describe the epidemiology of RICs sustained by high school athletes during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 school years.Prospective cohort study.A nationally representative sample of 100 US high schools using an injury surveillance system, High School Reporting Information Online.Athletes participating in football, boys' soccer, girls' soccer, volleyball, boys' basketball, girls' basketball, wrestling, baseball, or softball at one of the 100 participating high schools.We reviewed all RICs to calculate injury rates and to identify potential risk factors and preventive measures.A total of 321 RICs were sustained during 3 550 141 athlete-exposures (AEs), for an injury rate of 9.04 RICs per 100 000 AEs. This represents an estimated 84 223 RICs sustained nationally. The RICs accounted for 3.5% of all high school athletes' injuries. The most common diagnoses were neck and cervical injuries (62.0%, n = 199) and dehydration and heat illnesses (18.7%, n = 60). Football had the highest RIC rate per 100 000 AEs (21.2), followed by wrestling (15.2) and baseball (7.60). The RICs occurred at a higher rate in boys (12.4) than in girls (2.51) (rate ratio = 4.93; 95% confidence interval = 3.39, 7.18). The majority of RICs (67.3%, n = 216) permitted athletes to return to play within 1 week of diagnosis.The RIC injury rates varied by sport and sex and represented almost 100 000 potentially preventable injuries to high school athletes. Because of the potentially serious consequences, future researchers must develop and implement more effective preventive measures to aid certified athletic trainers in decreasing the RIC incidence among high school athletes."
6,Freeman-Sheldon syndrome: a case report.,"Freeman-Sheldon syndrome is a rare hereditary disorder characterised by three basic abnormalities, namely microstomia, camptodactyly with ulnar deviation of the fingers, and clubfoot. The majority of these patients have microstomia and dental crowding, making oral hygiene difficult and increasing the risk of caries. Treatment of these patients requires a coordinated effort by a team of specialists, including a paediatrician, an anaesthesiologist, a plastic surgeon, a paediatric dentist, and an orthodontist. Herein, we describe dental problems of a child with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome and the treatment procedures performed."
6,"Oral health in prehistoric San Pedro de Atacama oases, Northern Chile.","After almost 2000 years of local development, including limited trading with neighboring ethnic groups, the societies that occupied the oases of San Pedro de Atacama, Northern Chile, became part of the trade web of the Tiwanaku empire, between 500 and 1000 CE. Archaeological evidence tends to support the idea that the period under the influence of the altiplano (high plane) empire was very affluent. Here we investigate the possibility that this affluence had a positive impact on the health status of the Atacameneans, using the oral health as an indirect indicator of quality of life. Dental decay, dental abscess, dental wear, linear enamel hypoplasia, periodontal disease and dental calculus were analyzed on 371 skeletons from 12 sites from San Pedro de Atacama oases. We believe that if, indeed, there were better biological conditions during the altiplano influence, this could have been caused by the access to a more diversified food intake promoted by the intensification of the trading network established by Tiwanaku in the central-south Andes, of which San Pedro de Atacama became an important node. "
6,Clinical and radiographic findings of the temporomandibular joint in patients with various rheumatic diseases. A case-control study.,"To investigate subjective, clinical and radiographic findings relating to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and spondyloarthropathy (SPA), and to compare the findings with those in age- and sex-matched control subjects.Eighty patients (24 with RA, 16 with MCTD, 19 with AS, 21 with SPA) and 80 matched controls participated in the study. Replies to a questionnaire covering oral and TMJ symptoms were analysed in conjunction with medical histories, results of clinical examination of the stomatognathic system, and panoramic and lateral panoramic radiographs.Patients with rheumatic disease reported severe TMJ symptoms significantly oftener than control subjects (P < .001). Patients with AS reported symptoms most frequently (7/19, 37%). Mean maximal opening of the mouth (SD) was significantly less in patients with rheumatic disease (46.3 mm (8.6 mm)) than in control subjects (55.0 mm (7.4 mm)) (P < .001). Marked erosions were observed in 4 RA patients (17%), 3 MCTD patients (19%), 8 SPA patients (38%), 7 AS patients (37%), and 1 control subject (1%) (P < .001). The existence of erosion was associated with evidence of restricted movement of condyle in panoramic radiographs (P < .001). There was correlation between radiographic findings relating to the TMJ and subjective and clinical stomatognathic-system symptoms in patients with rheumatic disease. Subjective TMJ symptoms were associated with evidence of restricted movement of condyle in panoramic radiographs (P < .001). Impairment of laterotrusion movement was significantly associated with erosion (P < .001).The TMJ is commonly affected in patients with RA, and in patients with other forms of rheumatic disease. There are associations between radiographic findings and subjective symptoms, and between radiographic findings and restricted TMJ movement. In screening for suspected TMJ destruction, it would be appropriate to look for restricted maximal mouth opening, masticatory muscle tenderness and restricted laterotrusion."
6,Transient Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome after surgical resection of a right insulo-opercular low-grade glioma: case report.,"We describe an atypical case of transient Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome, or faciopharyngoglossomasticatory diplegia with automatic voluntary dissociation, occurring after surgical resection of a right insulo-opercular glioma.A 26-year-old right-handed man experienced partial seizures that were poorly controlled by antiepileptic drugs during a 2-year period as a result of a right insulo-opercular low-grade glioma, leading to the proposal of surgical resection. In addition, 1 year before the operation, the patient experienced a severe brain injury that resulted in a coma. A computed tomographic scan revealed left opercular contusion. The patient recovered completely within 6 months.Intraoperative corticosubcortical electrical functional mapping was performed along the resection, allowing the identification and preservation of the facial and upper limb motor structures. A subtotal removal of the glioma was achieved. The patient had postoperative anarthria, with loss of voluntary muscular functions of the face and tongue, and he had trouble chewing and swallowing. All of these symptoms resolved within 3 months.These findings provide insight into the use of surgery to treat a right insulo-opercular tumor. First, surgeons must be particularly cautious in cases with a potential contralateral lesion (e.g., history of head injury), even if such a lesion is not visible on magnetic resonance imaging scans; preoperative metabolic imaging and electrophysiological investigations should be considered before an operative decision is made. Second, surgeons must perform intraoperative functional mapping to identify and to attempt to preserve the corticosubcortical facial motor structures. A procedure performed while the patient is awake should be discussed to detect the structures involved in chewing and swallowing in cases of suspected bilateral lesions. Third, the patient must be informed of this particular risk before surgery is performed."
6,[Specific features of emergency dental care in pregnant women].,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the algorithm of safe emergency dental care in pregnant patients. Eighty-five pregnant women aged 20-35 were included in the study. The paper presents elaborated state-of-the-art guidelines for emergency dental care in pregnant patients. Articaine 4% with epinephrine 1:200,000 is recommended as a choice agent for local anesthesia in these patients."
6,[Peculiarities of oral health of organized collectives and professional communities].,"The analysis of scientific literature on the peculiarities of the dental status of organized groups and professional associations. After reviewing the literature, it becomes clear that the studies carried out in organized groups and professional societies are very relevant today, because the prevalence of dental diseases among them remains high, fueled by a number of factors: habitat, diet, lifestyle, occupational hazards, particularly hygienic oral care. Nowadays there is no information about the features of the dental status among the clergy, whose professional activity is connected with direct close contact with people. This profession covers a large number of our population. The research of certain groups is of special interest, since a number of different factors affect dental health."
6,Emergency Department Use for Dental Problems among Homeless Individuals: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"To evaluate emergency department (ED) visits for dental problems among Toronto's homeless population (Ontario, Canada).A random sample of 1,189 homeless was recruited from shelters and meal programs. Emergency department visits for non-traumatic dental problems (ICD-10-CA codes K00-K14) were identified using participants' health insurance number, during 2005-2009. Age- and sex-matched controls were selected from low-income neighborhoods.Homeless and matched controls had 182 and 10 ED visits for dental problems, respectively. Homeless people were more significantly more likely (OR=2.27, p=.007) to make ED visit for dental problems compared with controls. Over 80% of the ED visits by homeless people were for odontogenic infections, and 46% of homeless people had more than one such visit.The high rate of ED visits for dental problems by people who are homeless suggests that access to dental care is inadequate. The large number of repeat visits indicates that ED settings are ineffective for treatment of dental problems."
6,Oral Health in Low-Income Older Adults in Korea.,"Oral diseases among older adults are prevalent and a major public health problem, but public attention regarding this matter is quite limited. Many older adults experience limited access to oral care services. The study aimed to describe characteristics of oral health conditions, perceived oral health status, and oral health practices and to examine factors related to living status and accessibility to dental health care among 9,660 low-income older adults living in a suburban city in Korea. Approximately 42% of low-income older adults lived alone; 68% perceived their oral health as either excellent or good; and 31% reported difficulty accessing dental services. Lack of accessibility to oral care services was significantly more common in older adults with low incomes, living alone, having poor oral conditions, poor self-perceived oral health, and poor tooth-brushing behavior. Strategies to promote access to dental care services for underserved older adults should be developed to prevent further oral problems and their impact on overall health conditions. "
6,Oral health status of non-phobic and dentally phobic individuals; a secondary analysis of the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey.,"The aim of this study was to conduct an exploration of differences in oral health behaviour and outcome between dentally phobic and non-phobic participants in the UK Adult Dental Health Survey (ADHS, 2009). The null hypotheses for this study were that there are no differences in oral health status of non-phobic and dental phobic individuals.The ADHS survey covered the adult population in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and was commissioned by the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care (NHS IC). Dental anxiety was defined using the Modified Dental Anxiety (MDAS) with the cut-off point set at 19 and above as indicating dental phobia. Descriptive statistics were calculated and the chi-square test was used to compare both groups in terms of their demographics, oral health, oral health-related behaviour and attitudes, and treatment.More women (16.8% [1,023]) than men (7% [344]) reported dental phobia. Generally, people with dental phobia were in routine occupations (648 [47.7%]), single (402 [29.4%]) and with lower educational attainment (858 [80.9%]). They were irregular attendees (798 [58.5%]), had a less restored dentition, increased numbers of one or more teeth with caries (292 [39.9%]), and were more likely to have PUFA (puss, ulceration, fistulae, abscess) scores of one or more (89 [12.2%]) in comparison to the non-phobic group (314 [5.6%]). However, people with and without dental phobia had similar numbers of sound and missing teeth (34.5% of the phobic group had 20 or more sound teeth in comparison to 31.7% of the non-phobic group). There were significant differences (p<0.001) between the phobic group's and non-phobic group's Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP) and Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) scores with phobic participants having generally higher scores. Additionally, the phobic group responded negatively more commonly about their most recent dental treatment in terms of dentists' ability to listen to their concerns, explaining the reasons for their dental care while paying full attention to their needs by treating them with respect and dignity. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p<0.001).Participants reporting dental phobia are mostly females, irregular attendees and have a greater treatment need with increased caries levels."
6,[Deleterious factors of metal manufacture and the development of dental diseases].,Clinical evidence has been provided for the negative influence of the deleterious factors of metal manufacture and the extreme climatic and geographic conditions of the Far North.
6,Effects of removable dental prostheses on masticatory performance of subjects with shortened dental arches: A systematic review.,"To synthesise data on the effects of distal-extension removable dental prostheses (RDPs) on masticatory performance of subjects with (extreme) shortened dental arches ((E)SDAs).Search terms were: 'masticatory' respectively 'chewing' combined with 'performance', 'efficiency', or 'ability'.An electronic search restricted to the years 2003-2014 in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Science Direct databases.Studies exposing data on subjects with SDA (3-5 posterior occluding pairs) or ESDA (0-2 posterior occluding pairs) and on masticatory performance with RDP were included.Four studies provided data on comminution, three on mixing ability, and one on both tests. Comminution or mixing ability in subjects with (E)SDA was 28-39% lower compared to that of subjects with complete dentitions. In two studies, comminution outcomes when chewing with an RDP ranged from 2% to 32% reduction, indicating better chewing function (smaller X50) compared to comminution without the RDP. One study reported 28-83% lower mixing ability when chewing at the RDP side than chewing at the dentulous side. Generally, more artificial teeth (or longer occlusal platform) in experimental RDPs resulted in better comminution and better mixing ability (significant in four out of five studies), indicating a 'dose-effect' relationship.(1) Subjects with (E)SDA had a 30-40% reduced masticatory performance; (2) distal-extension RDPs could compensate this reduction partially (some 50%); and (3) more artificial teeth in RDPs resulted in better performance.Distal-extension RDPs in subjects with SDA partially compensate reduced masticatory performance."
6,Fighting Against Disuse of the Masticatory System in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: A Pilot Study Using Chewing Gum.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients report masticatory problems. The aim was to determine the efficacy of mastication training in Duchenne muscular dystrophy using chewing gum for 4 weeks. In all, 17 patients and 17 healthy age-matched males participated. The masticatory performance was assessed using a mixing ability test and measuring anterior bite force before, shortly after and 1 month after the training. In the patient group the masticatory performance improved and remained after 1-month follow-up, no significant changes in anterior maximum bite force was observed after mastication training. In the healthy subject the bite force increased and remained at the 1-month follow-up; no significant differences in masticatory performance were observed. Mastication training by using sugar-free chewing gum in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients improved their masticatory performance. Since bite force did not improve, the working mechanism of the improvement in chewing may relate to changes of the neuromuscular function and coordination, resulting in improvement of skills in performing mastication.

6,Prosthodontic management of a child with ectodermal dysplasia: a case report.,"Ectodermal dysplasia is a rare congenital disease that affects several ectodermal structures. Children with ectodermal dysplasia may have various manifestation of the disease that differ in severity and may or may not involve teeth, skin, hair, nails, sweat glands and sebaceous glands. The most common form of the ectodermal dysplasia syndrome is hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and is usually inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Female carriers may have a variable degree of clinical manifestations. This case report discusses the management of a 5-year-old girl with ectodermal dysplasia. Clinical management consisted of fabricating upper and lower dentures to help in psychosocial development and to restore the vertical dimension, esthetics and functioning of the stomatognathic system."
6,Older people and oral health: setting a patient-centred research agenda.,"The aim of this pilot study was to provide the opportunity to enable older people to prioritise the research agenda to improve their own oral health.Little is known about the ageing population's views about their oral health from their perspective. Priority Setting Partnerships (PSPs) incorporate users' perspectives to prioritise research agendas and are based on a series of sequential steps to build consensus. This structured approach ensures their narrative and thoughts are heard and helps counter the 'top-down' medical model that can dominate healthcare services.A PSP was undertaken with four key stakeholder groups: service users, carers, third sector and specialists. Six initial questions were posed to each group prior to a facilitated discussion led by one of the research team. Collective responses where then considered by a final consensus group. The views of the different groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim and underwent thematic analysis.The top three research priorities identified by the final group were to: (i) identify 'best practice' in the prevention and treatment of oral diseases for older people, (ii) identify the training needs for the dental profession and (iii) understand the key issues for older people from their perspective. Improving access to services, the importance of client appropriate information and the need for effective primary and secondary prevention were also articulated.Asking older people to prioritise the research agenda proved to be a positive experience. Key issues related to improving communication and the availability of appropriate evidence-based information on primary, secondary and tertiary prevention."
6,Dynorphin-A immunoreactive terminals on the neuronal somata of rat mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus.,"Dynorphin-A-like immunoreactivity was investigated in the rat mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (Mes 5) at the light and electron microscopic levels. Dynorphin-A immunoreactive fibers and puncta, likely representing nerve terminals, were observed throughout rostrocaudal extension of the Mes 5 at the light microscopic level. Within the rostrocaudal extension, more abundant fibers and puncta were localized in the midbrain-pontine junction and pontine areas than in the midbrain area. At the electron microscopic level, dynorphin-A immunoreactive synapses were observed on the somata of Mes 5. Dynorphin-A-like immunoreactivity tended to be restricted to dense-cored vesicles in the synapses. These results suggest that dynorphin-A-containing fiber systems affect mastication through the Mes 5."
6,Dental management in renal failure: patients on dialysis.,"Chronic renal failure is an important health care problem throughout the world, with an incidence of 337, 90, 107 and 95 new cases per million inhabitants/year in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, respectively. These figures moreover invariably tend to increase. During the progression of renal damage, clinical manifestations are noted in practically all body organs and systems, and 90% of all affected patients experience oral symptoms. The existing management options range from simple measures based on changes in diet and life style, to different forms of dialysis (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis), and also kidney transplantation. Given the multiple oral manifestations of chronic renal failure, and the different repercussions of its treatment upon the oral cavity, these patients require special considerations and precautions in the face of dental treatment. Consultation with the nephrologist is essential before any dental treatment is carried out, in order to determine the condition of the patient, define the best moment for dental treatment, introduce the necessary pharmacological adjustments, or to establish other important aspects for preventing complications in the dental clinic. The present study reviews the characteristics of the disease, the existing therapeutic options, and the considerations of relevance for the dental professional."
6,General practitioners' attitudes towards the management of dental conditions and use of antibiotics in these consultations: a qualitative study.,"This study aimed to produce an account of the attitudes of general practitioners (GPs) towards the management of dental conditions in general practice, and sought to explore how GPs use antibiotics in the treatment of dental problems.Qualitative study employing semistructured telephone interviews and thematic analysis.17 purposively sampled GPs working in Wales, of which 9 were male. The median number of years since graduation was 21. Maximum variation sampling techniques were used to ensure participants represented different Rural-Urban localities, worked in communities with varying levels of deprivation, and had differing lengths of practising career.Most GPs reported regularly managing dental problems, with more socioeconomically deprived patients being particularly prone to consult. Participants recognised that dental problems are not optimally managed in general practice, but had sympathy with patients experiencing dental pain who reported difficulty obtaining an emergency dental consultation. Many GPs considered antibiotics an acceptable first-line treatment for acute dental problems and reported that patients often attended expecting to receive antibiotics. GPs who reported that their usual practice was to prescribe antibiotics were more likely to prioritise patients' immediate needs, whereas clinicians who reported rarely prescribing often did so to encourage patients to consult a dental professional.The presentation of patients with dental problems presents challenges to GPs who report concerns about their ability to manage such conditions. Despite this, many reported frequently prescribing antibiotics for patients with dental conditions. This may contribute to both patient morbidity and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. This research has identified the need for quantitative data on general practice consultations for dental problems and qualitative research exploring patient perspectives on reasons for consulting. The findings of these studies will inform the design of an intervention to support patients in accessing appropriate care when experiencing dental problems."
6,The accuracy of International Classification of Diseases coding for dental problems not associated with trauma in a hospital emergency department.,"Emergency department (ED) visits for nontraumatic dental conditions (NTDCs) may be a sign of unmet need for dental care. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of the International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-10-CA) for ED visits for NTDC.ED visits in 2008-2099 at one hospital in Toronto were identified if the discharge diagnosis in the administrative database system was an ICD-10-CA code for a NTDC (K00-K14). A random sample of 100 visits was selected, and the medical records for these visits were reviewed by a dentist. The description of the clinical signs and symptoms were evaluated, and a diagnosis was assigned. This diagnosis was compared with the diagnosis assigned by the physician and the code assigned to the visit.The 100 ED visits reviewed were associated with 16 different ICD-10-CA codes for NTDC. Only 2 percent of these visits were clearly caused by trauma. The code K0887 (toothache) was the most frequent diagnostic code (31 percent). We found 43.3 percent disagreement on the discharge diagnosis reported by the physician, and 58.0 percent disagreement on the code in the administrative database assigned by the abstractor, compared with what it was suggested by the dentist reviewing the chart.There are substantial discrepancies between the ICD-10-CA diagnosis assigned in administrative databases and the diagnosis assigned by a dentist reviewing the chart retrospectively. However, ICD-10-CA codes can be used to accurately identify ED visits for NTDC."
6,"Sociodemographic conditions, knowledge of dental diseases, dental care, and dietary habits.","This study's aim was to present data on the sociodemographic conditions, knowledge of dental diseases, dental care, and dietary habits among children aged 3, 5, 10, and 15 years in Da Nang, Vietnam.A cross-sectional epidemiological questionnaire study was conducted in a population of 840 children randomly selected by their year and month of birth (January to July), including 210 individuals in each age group. A self-reported questionnaire was completed by the parents of 3- and 5-year-olds, and a modified questionnaire was given to 10- and 15-year-olds to complete by themselves.Mass media constituted the main source of oral healthcare information. Parents assisted with tooth brushing in 86 percent of 3-year-olds and 71 percent of 5-year-olds. Fluoride toothpaste was used by 44-78 percent of children, with no clear age-related trend. Within the past year, 60 percent of 3- and 5-year-olds, 20 percent of 10-year-olds, and 49 percent of 15-year-olds reported they had not visited a dental professional. Sweets were consumed between principal meals by 70-80 percent of children. Milk with sugar was regularly consumed by 71 percent of 3-year-olds and 91 percent of 5-year-olds.Children showed frequent sugar consumption and insufficient frequency of brushing their teeth with fluoride toothpaste. Food-based dietary guidelines should play a significant role in nutrition and oral health. It is especially important that oral health prevention programs reach preschool children before they establish unhealthy dietary habits. Parental education about oral health and access to oral healthcare services are also needed to improve children's oral health."
6,The deterioration of Canadian immigrants' oral health: analysis of the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada.,"To examine the effect of immigration on the self-reported oral health of immigrants to Canada over a 4-year period.The study used Statistics Canada's Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (LSIC 2001-2005). The target population comprised 3976 non-refugee immigrants to Canada. The dependent variable was self-reported dental problems. The independent variables were as follows: age, sex, ethnicity, income, education, perceived discrimination, history of social assistance, social support, and official language proficiency. A generalized estimation equation approach was used to assess the association between dependent and independent variables.After 2 years, the proportion of immigrants reporting dental problems more than tripled (32.6%) and remained approximately the same at 4 years after immigrating (33.3%). Over time, immigrants were more likely to report dental problems (OR = 2.77; 95% CI 2.55-3.02). An increase in self-reported dental problems over time was associated with sex, history of social assistance, total household income, and self-perceived discrimination.An increased likelihood of reporting dental problems occurred over time. Immigrants should arguably constitute an important focus of public policy and programmes aimed at improving their oral health and access to dental care in Canada."
6,Predictive value of combined clinically diagnosed bruxism and occlusal features for TMJ pain.,"Several works showed a decreased role for occlusion in the etiology of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Nonetheless, it may be hypothesized that occlusion acts as a modulator through which bruxism activities may cause damage to the stomatognathic structures. To test this hypothesis, a logistic regression model was created with the inclusion of clinically diagnosed bruxism and eight occlusal features as potential predictors for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in a sample of 276 consecutive TMD patients. The final logit showed that the percentage of the total log likelihood for TMJ pain explained by the significant factors was small and amounted to 13.2%, with unacceptable levels of sensitivity (16.4%). The parameters overbite > or = 4 mm combined with clinically diagnosed bruxism [OR (odds ratio) 4.62], overjet > or = 5 mm (OR 2.83), and asymmetrical molar relationship combined with clinically diagnosed bruxism (OR 2.77) were those with the highest odds for disease, even though none of those values was significant with respect to confidence intervals. Thus, the hypothesis under evaluation has to be rejected. It is possible that future studies with a higher discriminatory power for the different bruxism activities might be indicated to get deeper into the analysis of the potential mechanisms through which occlusion may play a role, even if small, in the etiology of the different TMD."
6,Activities of masticatory muscles in patients before orthognathic surgery.,"To compare the influence of occlusal versus craniofacial characteristics on the functionality of the stomatognathic apparatus.Two groups of subjects were selected: 27 patients (13 women and 14 men), 18 to 42 years old, all candidates for orthognathic surgery, 7 with prognathic syndrome and 20 with progenic syndrome; and 26 healthy young adults (13 women and 13 men) of corresponding age (control group). To verify the neuromuscular equilibrium induced by occlusion, the electromyographic activities of both right and left masseter and anterior temporal muscles were recorded and analyzed, calculating the percentage overlapping coefficient (an index of the symmetric distribution of the muscular activity determined by the occlusion) and TORS (index of the presence of mandibular torque). Data were compared with Student t-test for independent samples.Between the 2 groups of patients, no statistically significant differences were found, whereas the statistical analysis showed differences between patients and control subjects (P < 0.05): overall, the control subjects had a better neuromuscular stability than the patients who were candidates for orthognathic surgery.The electromyographic evaluations revealed that there was a neuromuscular imbalance determined by an occlusal instability in the patients candidates for orthognathic surgery, thus indicating that occlusion plays a more important role than any possible mechanical disadvantages due to altered craniofacial morphology."
6,Oral rehabilitation of primary dentition affected by amelogenesis imperfecta: a case report.,"The purpose of the case report was to describe the treatment of a 4(1/2)-year-old boy with amelogenesis imperfect (AI) in the primary dentition.AI is a hereditary condition that affects the development of enamel, causing quantity, structural, and compositional anomalies involving all dentitions. Consequently, the effects can extend to both the primary and secondary dentitions.A 4(1/2)-year-old boy was brought to the dental clinic complaining of tooth hypersensitivity during meals. The medical history and clinical examination were used to arrive at the diagnosis of amelogenesis imperfecta. The treatment was oral rehabilitation of the primary molars with stainless steel crowns and resin-filled celluloid forms of both maxillary and mandibular primary incisors and canines. Improvements in the patient's psychological behavior and the elimination of tooth sensitiveness were observed, and the reestablishment of a normal occlusion resulted in improved eating habits. The child was monitored in the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic at four-month intervals until the mixed dentition stage.The oral rehabilitation of young children with AI is necessary to reestablish the stomatognathic system function, so important for a child's systemic health. An adequate medical history and a careful clinical examination were essential for a correct diagnosis. Treatment was rendered that was appropriate for the child's age and clinical/psychological characteristics.Cost-effective restorative techniques involving stainless steel and composite-resin crowns are shown for the restoration of a young patient with amelogensis imperfecta."
6,Effects of occlusal contact and its area on gravity fluctuation.,"To examine changes in gravity fluctuation caused by experimentally altering the area of occlusal contact.Subjects consisted of 15 adult Japanese males with normal stomatognathic function, no missing teeth except for the third molars, and equivalent occlusal contact in the anterior and bilateral posterior regions. Silicon biteplates fabricated for each subject to evaluate gravity fluctuation in relation to changes in occlusal contact area were as follows: RP(-)-OC(+) (entire occlusal surface covered in centric occlusion); RP(+)-OC(+) (entire occlusal surface covered with bite slightly raised); Ant or Pos/RP(+)-OC(+) (anterior or posterior region selectively covered); and RP(+)-OC(-) (only retromolar pads covered, no occlusal coverage).No significant differences in gravity fluctuation were noted between subjects wearing biteplates covering the entire occlusal surface. Subjects wearing biteplates with no occlusal contact showed greater gravity fluctuation than those with occlusal contact. In addition, gravity fluctuation for the Ant/RP(+)-OC(+) group (no occlusal contact in the posterior region) was greater than for RP(+)-OC(+) and Pos/RP(+)-OC(+). However, groups with unilateral occlusal contact in the posterior region exhibited large right and left sway amplitude.These results suggest that occlusal contact, especially posterior occlusal contact, affects gravity fluctuation, and that appropriate occlusion attained by maintaining even occlusal contact in the posterior region is crucial for gravity fluctuation."
6,Analysis of tongue pressure in Brazilian young adults.,"To present the measures for tongue pressure in Brazilian young adults, considering specific tasks, and to verify the differences regarding gender and according to the tasks.Fifty-one volunteers aged 18 to 28 years, of both genders with normal occlusion and without speech disorders were evaluated. We used the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument in the evaluation of tongue pressure (kilopascal) during specific tests of elevation, protrusion, swallowing, and lateralization, in addition to the endurance test (seconds). The analysis was conducted using analysis of variance, followed by the Tukey's multiple comparison test, adopting a 5% significance level.The values obtained for men and women in the tests were as follows: elevation, 63.94??12.92 and 50.27??15.29; protrusion, 60.22??13.62 and 44.30??12.95; swallowing, 33.94??12.06 and 34.27??13.25; lateralization on the right, 44.15??10.47 and 31.85??8.46; lateralization on the left, 43.15??10.22 and 29.55??8.91; and endurance test: 24.85??10.95 and 17.35??6.71, respectively. The values were higher in men compared with women for the protrusion and lateralization tasks. The measures of the protrusion and elevation tasks did not differ for men but were higher in both genders than those of the lateralization and the swallowing tests. There was no difference in lateralization according to side in both the genders.The measures for the tongue pressure in Brazilian young adults were determined by specific tasks. Gender influenced the pressure of the tongue values for the protrusion and lateralization tasks. Elevation and protrusion tasks measures were higher than those of the lateralization and swallowing tasks."
6,Health and sleep problems in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome: a case control study.,"Self-injury, sleep problems and health problems are commonly reported in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) but there are no comparisons with appropriately matched participants. The relationship between these areas and comparison to a control group is warranted.54 individuals with CdLS were compared with 46 participants with intellectual disability (ID) of mixed aetiology who were similar in terms of degree of ID, mobility, age and gender using informant-based measures of health problems, sleep and self-injury.Participants with CdLS experienced significantly more current and lifetime health problems with eye problems and gastrointestinal disorders prominent. Although 55% of those with CdLS experienced sleep problems this prevalence was not different from the comparison group. Sleep disorder was not associated with self-injury in the CdLS group, skin problems were associated with severity of self-injury but not presence.People with CdLS experience a range of significant health problems and have more health concerns than others with the same degree of ID. Although this has been well documented in the past, the current high prevalence of health concerns indicates the need for regular health assessment and appropriate intervention."
6,Consent - a new era begins.,"The law in relation to consent has changed following the handing down of the Supreme Court judgement in Montgomery vs Lanarkshire in March this year. Legally, clinicians, including dentists, must now take reasonable care to ensure that patients are aware of any material risks involved in a proposed treatment and of reasonable alternatives. This case now brings the law in relation to the disclosure of risks when obtaining consent to treatment in line with the guidance issued by regulatory bodies such as the GMC and GDC. "
6,A stepwise multiple regression model to assess the odds ratio between myofascial pain and 13 occlusal features in 238 Italian women.,"To quantify the relative risk of multiple occlusal variables for muscular disorders of the stomatognathic system.Thirteen occlusal features were clinically assessed by the same three operators: partial unilateral posterior reverse articulation, anterior open occlusal relationship, vertical anterior overlap (normal value < 4 mm), complete unilateral posterior reverse articulation, anterior overjet (normal value < 5 mm), incisor midline discrepancy (normal value < 2 mm), Angle Class I canine and molar relationship; plus dynamic occlusion features such as length and symmetry of retruded contact position-intercanine position (RCP/ICP) slides (normal value < 2 mm), occlusal guidance patterns, and mediotrusive and laterotrusive interferences. The sample consisted of 156 women with only muscular disorders according to the Group I Research Diagnostic Criteria for temporomandibular disorders and 82 healthy women (control group). A stepwise multiple logistic regression model was used to identify the significant correlation between occlusal features and disease.The odds ratio for myofascial pain was 2.6 for absence of canine guidance, 2.0 for laterotrusive interference, 2.3 for mediotrusive interference, and 1.9 for reverse articulation. Other occlusal variables did not reveal statistical significance. The percentage of the total log likelihood for myofascial pain explained by the significant occlusal factors was acceptable with a Nagelkerke R2 = 0.2. The final model including the significative occlusal features revealed an optimal discriminant capacity to predict patients with myofascial pain with a sensitivity of 62.2%, or healthy subjects with a specificity of 93.6%, and an accuracy of 82.8%.Few occlusal features show a significative predictive value for myofascial pain."
6,Posture and posterior crossbite in oral and nasal breathing children.,"The most known etiologic factors of oral breathing may influence the craniofacial development leading to anatomical and functional alterations. A proper head and cervical spine posture allows a well functioning of the stomatognathic system structures and vice versa. This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of posterior crossbite in a group of oral breathing children (OB) and nasal (NB) and associate the type of bite with the head and cervical spine posture. It was concluded that most of the children, either oral or nasal breathers, did not present a crossbite and any kind of head posture and cervical spine can vary independently of a posterior crossbite."
6,The FTB (Flores Twin Block): a new fixed functional appliance.,"Functional Orthopaedics, Functionalism and their appliances have as their objective to correct the skeletal dysplasia that underlies many malocclusions, taking advantage of the potential of the stomatognathic system's strength. The range of functional appliances is very extensive and there is a great variety thereof. Basically, functional appliances can be: removable functional appliances and fixed functional appliances. In this article, we are going to present a new design for fixed functional appliances for the treatment of Class II, basing ourselves on the biomechanical principles of the Twin Block. We believe this new design, compared with other fixed functional appliances currently in use, improves patient comfort, providing a more effective response and helps us to treat our Class II cases with total success."
6,Anatomical location of various condylar points for jaw movement analysis in Japanese women.,"The aim of this study was to determine anatomical locations of the hinge axis point, kinematic axis point and reference point for the palpated lateral condylar pole on lateral cephalograms. Subjects comprised 18 Japanese women selected according to following criteria: normal occlusion; and absence of signs and symptoms of stomatognathic function. Jaw movement and the condylar reference points noted earlier were recorded three-dimensionally with six degrees of freedom, and kinematic axis point and hinge axis point were determined using an optoelectronic jaw-tracking system. Lateral cephalograms were used to determine anatomical locations of the three points in the condyle. Mean location of hinge axis point was 12.9 mm anterior of the porion and 5.3 mm inferior to the Frankfort horizontal plane, the kinematic axis point was situated in 12.8 mm anterior and 0.1 mm inferior, and the reference point for the palpated lateral condylar pole was situated 10.7 mm anterior and 0.8 mm inferior, respectively. The kinematic axis point was located outside the condyle in the majority of subjects. The reference point for the palpated lateral pole offers a useful indicator in the analysis of condylar movements."
6,The association between current unemployment and clinically determined poor oral health.,"The aim of this study was to assess whether current unemployment was associated with poor oral health and whether there was a difference in oral health according to the duration of the current unemployment.As part of the Health 2000 Survey in Finland (a nationwide comprehensive health examination survey), we used its data based on interviews, questionnaires, and clinical oral examinations of the 30- to 63-year-old respondents (n = 4773). Current employment status was measured in its dichotomous form, employed versus unemployed, and length of current unemployment was classified into four categories. We measured oral health in terms of numbers of missing teeth, of sound teeth, of filled teeth, of decayed teeth, and of teeth with deepened periodontal pockets (???4 mm, ???6 mm). Poisson regression models were fitted for all oral health outcomes except number of decayed teeth, for which negative binomial regression model was used. Oral health-related behaviors and sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were added to the analyses.The unemployed subjects had higher numbers of missing teeth, of decayed teeth, and of teeth with periodontal pockets than the employed ones. The association remained consistent even after adjustments. Oral health-related behaviors seemed to mediate the association. We found no association between unemployment and number of sound teeth. Current long-term unemployment showed stronger association with poor oral health than short-term among women.The unemployed can be considered as a risk group for poor oral health. Oral healthcare should be reoriented toward those who are unemployed."
6,Dental health knowledge in a group of Black adolescents living in rural South Carolina.,"This study investigated levels of dental health knowledge and factors associated with adequate dental health knowledge in a group of black adolescents living in rural areas. Using a self-administered questionnaire, data were collected on a convenience sample of 151 black adolescents aged 10 to 18 yrs living in rural South Carolina. The mean percent correct on the dental health knowledge questions was 55.0%. Using 75% as the cutoff for adequate dental health knowledge, only 7.9% of the respondents achieved this level. Two thirds of the younger adolescents (aged 10-12 yrs) were below the median on dental health knowledge. Respondents selected dental health professionals, family, and school as the three main sources of dental health information. Results from univariate logistic regression analyses indicated that being older, having a regular dentist for routine care, and having learned about dental health from dental health professionals, family, mass media, and friends were significantly associated with adequate dental health knowledge. After adjusting for other explanatory factors, adequate dental health knowledge was associated with being older and having learned about dental health from friends. This group of adolescents seems to have limited dental health knowledge with misconceptions concerning periodontal health and caries prevention. This was especially evident in younger adolescents. Incorporation of peer dental health education in school is worthwhile to investigate as a means to enhance the dental health knowledge of these adolescents."
6,Odontogenic Maxillofacial Infections: A Ten-Year Retrospective Analysis.,"To analyze treatment modalities and results in patients with severe odontogenic maxillofacial infections during a 10-y period.Medical records of 1,077 patients hospitalized because of severe odontogenic maxillofacial infections during 2003-2012 were reviewed. The sample consisted of the records that matched inclusion criteria. For each patient the following data were collected: Age, gender, presence of systemic diseases, length of hospital stay, causal tooth, location of inflammation, treatment, results of bacteriologic sampling, and anti-bacterial susceptibility.Male to female ratio was 1.4:1. Two or more anatomic spaces were involved in 42.9% of cases, 37.3% of which involved the floor of the mouth. Penicillin in combination with gentamicin or metronidazole was prescribed in 69% of cases. Sixty-two different micro-organism species were identified with predominance of Streptococcus haemolyticus (42.9%). The microbial analysis showed the highest susceptibility of predominant micro-organisms to penicillin was 76.9% and the highest resistance was to metronidazole (27.9%).The frequency of odontogenic maxillofacial infection remained almost unchanged during a 10-y period. Single-space infections were more common (57.1%) than infections involving two or more spaces. Susceptibility to penicillin remains relatively high; therefore, penicillin can remain part of the armamentarium for treatment of odontogenic maxillofacial infections."
6,"Relationships of beta-blockers and anxiolytics intake and salivary secretion, masticatory performance and taste perception.","Assess the influence of salivary flow on physiological parameters of the stomatognathic system in patients who take beta-blockers or anxiolytic medications.Sixty patients were divided into three groups based on the following criteria: Group 1, control (n=20; no use of medication); Group 2, use of antihypertensive beta-blockers (n=20); and Group 3, use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics (n=20). Salivary flow was assessed by determining stimulated and non-stimulated flow/minute. The quantification of the sense of taste was determined on a visual analogue scale (VAS) using solutions of 0.9% NaCl (salty), 50% sucrose (sweet), 20% unsweetened coffee (bitter) and 4.2% vinegar (sour). The DMFT index (number of decayed/missing/filled teeth) was determined by a calibrated examination, following the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Masticatory performance was assessed with an Optosil comminution test and Rosim-Ramler equation.The results did not reveal a significant correlation between salivary flow and masticatory performance (p>0.05). We observed significant decreased non-stimulated salivary flow for Group 2 (p=0.05) when compared to controls. However, taste perception was not influenced by salivary secretion amongst groups. Furthermore, we observed a significant negative correlation between non-stimulated salivary flow and DMFT in Group 1 (p=0.02; r=-0.52).Patients under beta-blockers therapy presented reduced non-stimulated salivary flow when compared to controls, without influencing the sense of taste or masticatory performance. The use of anxiolytics did not affect salivary flow and taste perception in the studied sample."
6,Risk of dental disease non-battle injuries and severity of dental disease in deployed U.S. Army personnel.,"Dental Disease and Non-Battle Injuries (D-DNBI) continue to be a problem among U.S. Army active duty (AD), U.S. Army National Guard (ARNG), and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) deployed soldiers to Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn in Iraq and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. A previous study reported the annual rates to be 136 D-DNBI per 1,000 personnel for AD, 152 for ARNG, and 184 for USAR. The objectives of this study were to describe D-DNBI incidence and to determine risk factors for dental encounters and high severity diagnoses for deployed soldiers. The 78 diagnoses were classified into three categories based on severity. Poisson regression was used to compare D-DNBI rates and logistic regression was used to analyze the risk of high severity D-DNBI. In both campaigns, Reserve had a higher risk of D-DNBI than active duty. For Afghanistan, ARNG and USAR demonstrated over 50% increased risk of D-DNBI compared to AD. In Iraq, USAR had a 17% increased risk over AD. Females had a higher risk of D-DNBI (>50%) compared to males in both campaigns. High severity D-DNBI made up 2.77% of all diagnoses. Within Afghanistan, there was a 4.6% increased risk of high severity D-DNBI for each additional deployment month. "
6,[Impact of working conditions at a general mechanical rubber goods plant on dental morbidity in its workers].,"The impact of working conditions on dental morbidity was studied in workers from the Kazan general mechanical rubber goods (GMRG) plant. Analysis of the results of studying the prevalence of major dental diseases in the workers of the GMRG plant showed that the number of patients with caries, noncarious lesions, as well as periodontal diseases is far in excess of those in the control group. The studies, conducted in terms of the age and length of service of the examinees, corroborate the influence of adverse industrial factors on the prevalence of major dental diseases."
6,"Pharmacology of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors on neurons involved in feeding behavior in the pond snail, Helisoma trivolvis.","Glutamate is a key regulatory neurotransmitter in the triphasic central pattern generator controlling feeding behavior in the pond snail, Helisoma trivolvis. It excites phase two motor neurons while inhibiting those in phases one and three. However, the receptors that mediate this regulation are only partially characterized. The purpose of these experiments was to further characterize the glutamate receptors on three buccal neurons modulated by glutamate. Intracellular recordings from B5, B19 and B27 neurons were taken during the perfusion of isolated buccal ganglia with agonists that are selective for different vertebrate glutamate receptors. The firing rate of all three neurons was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by glutamate, including that of B27, a phase 2 motor neuron known to be excited by glutamate in vivo. Quisqualate also reduced the firing rate in all three neurons, and (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD), a relatively non-selective metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, reduced the firing rate in B5 neurons, but not in B19 or B27 neurons. Agonists selective for vertebrate group I, II and III mGluRs did not affect the firing rate in any of the Helisoma buccal neurons tested, suggesting that mGluR agonist binding sites on these neurons do not closely resemble those on any vertebrate mGluR subtypes. An increase in frequency of action potentials was observed in all three cell types in the presence of 100 micromol l(-1) kainate (KA), suggesting the presence of excitatory (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/KA-like receptors. However, electrotonic coupling between B19 and B27 neurons, and a lack of effect of KA on isolated B19 neurons suggest the excitatory effects of KA on this neuron are indirect. These findings suggest the presence of multiple glutamate receptor subtypes in molluscan neurons that do not always resemble vertebrate receptors pharmacologically."
5,"Bacterial diversity of the digestive gland of Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata infected with the paramyxean parasite, Marteilia sydneyi.","To determine whether the infestation by the protozoan paramyxean parasite, Marteilia sydneyi, changes the bacterial community of the digestive gland of Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata.Six 16S rDNA clone libraries were established from three M. sydneyi-infected and three un-infected oysters. Restriction enzyme analysis followed by sequencing representative clones revealed a total of 23 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in un-infected oysters, comprising the major phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Spirocheates, where the clone distribution was 44, 36, 7 and 5%, respectively. Close to half of the OTUs are not closely related to any other hitherto determined sequence. In contrast, S. glomerata infected by M. sydneyi had only one OTU present in the digestive gland. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence reveals that this dominant OTU, belonging to the alpha-Proteobacteria, is closely related to a Rickettsiales-like prokaryote (RLP).The microbiota of the digestive gland of Sydney rock oysters is changed by infection by M. sydneyi, becoming dominated by a RLP, and generally less diverse. The bacterial community of un-infected S. glomerata differs from previous studies in that we identified the dominant taxa as Firmicutes and alpha-Proteobacteria, rather than heterotrophic gamma-Proteobacteria.This is the first culture-independent study of the microbiota of the digestive glands of edible oysters to the species level. The commercial viability of the Sydney rock oyster industry in Australia is currently threatened by Queensland Unknown disease and the changes in the bacterial community of S. glomerata corresponding with infection by M. sydneyi sheds further light on the link between parasite infection and mortality in this economically damaging disease."
5,Role for retinoid signaling in left-right asymmetric digestive organ morphogenesis.,"The looping events that establish left-right asymmetries in the vertebrate gut tube are poorly understood. Retinoic acid signaling is known to impact left-right development in multiple embryonic contexts, although its role in asymmetric digestive organ morphogenesis is unknown. Here, we show that the genes for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH2) and a retinoic acid hydroxylase (CYP26A1) are expressed in complementary patterns in the Xenopus gut during looping. A late-stage chemical genetic assessment reveals that agonists and antagonists of retinoid signaling generate abnormal gut looping topologies, digestive organ heterotaxias, and intestinal malrotations. Accessory organ deformities commonly associated with intestinal malrotation in humans, such as annular pancreas, pancreas divisum, and extrahepatic biliary tree malformations, are also induced by distinct retinoid receptor agonists. Thus, late-stage retinoic acid signaling is likely to play a critical role in asymmetric gut tube morphogenesis and may underlie the etiology of several clinically relevant defects in the digestive system."
5,Development of digestive tract and enzyme activities during the early ontogeny of the tropical gar Atractosteus tropicus.,"Changes in digestive enzyme activity and histology were studied in Atractosteus tropicus embryos, larvae and juvenile periods. Alkaline protease, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase A, lipase and ??-amylase were detected in all periods and gradually increased until reaching the maximum peak in juveniles; meanwhile, acid protease was first detected at 5??days after hatching (dah) when first feeding started and trypsin and leucine aminopeptidase activities were detected from 19 dah, their values being increased gradually until reaching a maximum value at 31 dah. Acid and alkaline phosphatase activities increased from yolk-sac absorption (3 dah) until day 31 after hatching. Zymogram for acid protease showed two bands in active forms (0.4 and 0.5 Rfs) from day 5 after hatching and a third protease form (0.3 Rf) that appears at 31 dah. Two active forms (26.3 and 24.9??kDa) were detected using SDS-PAGE alkaline proteases zymogram at 5 dah, and an additional active form (44.1 kDa) was detected at 7 dah. Regarding the histological development of the digestive system, the exocrine pancreas containing zymogen granules was already visible at 3 dah, whereas at 5 dah first gastric glands were already detected in the stomach. Between 7 and 9 dah, the digestive tract of A. tropicus resembled that of a juvenile specimen with a well-developed and short oesophagus, stomach divided into a glandular and non-glandular (pyloric) stomach, folded intestine with pyloric caeca and a well-developed spiral valve (posterior intestine). Considering this, larvae of A. tropicus are capable of digesting several foods from yolk absorption (3 dah), maximizing its activities at 15 dah, age at which the organisms maximize its capability to absorb nutrients from diets provided. "
5,Surgical-site infection risk in oncologic digestive surgery.,"Surgical-site infection (SSI) is the most prevalent type of hospital infection in surgical patients and is associated with an increase in hospital stay, costs and morbidity/lethality. The knowledge of the main risk factors for this type of infection is important for the establishment of prevention measures regarding modifiable risks factors. The objective of the preset study was to assess the occurrence of SSI and study the risk factors in oncologic surgeries of the digestive system at Hospital de C??ncer in Barretos, S??o Paulo, Brazil. Individuals undergoing oncologic surgeries of the digestive system in the period of 08/01/2007 to 08/10/2008 were prospectively followed for 30 days after surgery. Possible risk factors related to the patient and to the surgical procedure were also studied. A total of 210 surgeries were analyzed, with a global SSI incidence of 23.8%. The following variables were independently associated with SSI: time and type of surgery, radiotherapy before surgery and surgeon's years of experience. The risk factors found in this study have been described by other authors and are not amenable to intervention for SSI prevention. Further studies are recommended with the objective of investigating interventions that could reduce the risk for SSI in this type of surgery."
5,[Liner interventional endoscopic ultrasound in diseases of the digestive system].,"The evident advantages of the endoscopic ultrasound, upon the complementary imaging methods, as are transabdominal ultrasound, the spiral CT, the nuclear magnet resonance, potentioned by the development of the techniques for the taking of biopsies, and the possibilities of the microinvasive surgical approach to the environment organs and tissues. Besides the standard achievement of the material for the cytologic and pathohistologic analysis is opened the possibility of the therapeutic application of the medicaments, that is the drainage collection in the abdomen and by ""stapler"" technique of the establishing of the anastomoza."
5,"Within gut physicochemical variation does not correspond to distinct resident fungal and bacterial communities in the tree-killing xylophage, Anoplophora glabripennis.","Insect guts harbor diverse microbial assemblages that can be influenced by multiple factors, including gut physiology and interactions by the host with its environment. The Asian longhorned beetle (A. glabripennis; Cerambycidae: Lamiinae) is an invasive tree-killing insect that harbors a diverse consortium of fungal and bacterial gut associates that provision nutrients and facilitate lignocellulose digestion. The physicochemical conditions of the A. glabripennis gut and how these conditions may influence the microbial composition across gut regions are unknown. In this study, we used microsensors to measure in situ oxygen concentrations, pH, and redox potential along the length of the A. glabripennis larval gut from two North American populations. We then analyzed and compared bacterial and fungal gut communities of A. glabripennis within individual hosts along the length of the gut using 16S and ITS1 amplicon sequencing. The A. glabripennis midgut lumen was relatively anoxic (<0.01kPa) with a pH gradient from 5.5 to 9, moving anterior to posterior. Redox potential was higher in the anterior midgut relative to posterior regions. No differences in physicochemistry were measured between the two populations of the beetle, but the two populations harbored different communities of bacteria and fungi. However, microbial composition of the A. glabripennis gut microbiota did not differ among gut regions despite physicochemical differences. Unlike other insect systems that have distinct gut compartmentalization and corresponding microbial assemblages, the A. glabripennis gut lacks dramatic morphological modifications, which may explain why discrete microbial community structures were not found along the digestive system."
5,Polymorphism and partial characterization of digestive enzymes in the spiny lobster Panulirus argus.,"We characterized major digestive enzymes in Panulirus argus using a combination of biochemical assays and substrate-(SDS or native)-PAGE. Protease and amylase activities were found in the gastric juice while esterase and lipase activities were higher in the digestive gland. Trypsin-like activity was higher than chymotrypsin-like activity in the gastric juice and digestive gland. Stability and optimal conditions for digestive enzyme activities were examined under different pHs, temperature and ionic strength. The use of protease inhibitors showed the prevalence of serine proteases and metalloproteases. Results for serine proteases were corroborated by zymograms where several isotrypsins-like (17-21 kDa) and isochymotrypsin-like enzymes (23-38 kDa) were identified. Amylases (38-47 kDa) were detected in zymograms and a complex array of non-specific esterases isoenzymes was found in the digestive gland. Isoenzyme polymorphism was found for trypsin, amylase, and esterase. This study is the first to evidence the biochemical bases of the plasticity in feeding habits of P. argus. Distribution and properties of enzymes provided some indication on how the digestion takes place and constitute baseline data for further studies on the digestion physiology of spiny lobsters."
5,Translation and psychometric evaluation of the Chinese version of functional digestive disorders quality of life questionnaire.,"Few useful patient-reported outcomes scales for functional dyspepsia exist in China.The purpose of this work was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the Functional Digestive Disorders Quality of Life Questionnaire (FDDQL) from the English version to Chinese (in??Mandarin).The following steps were performed: forward translations, synthesis of the translations, backward translations, pre-testing and field testing of FDDQL. Reliability, validity, responsiveness, confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory and differential item functioning of the scale were analyzed.A total of 300 functional dyspepsia patients and 100 healthy people were included. The total Cronbach's alpha was 0.932, and split-half reliability coefficient was 0.823 with all test-retest coefficients greater than 0.9 except Coping With Disease domain. In construct validity analysis, every item correlated higher with its own domain than others. The comparative fit index of FDDQL was 0.902 and root mean square error of approximation was 0.076. Functional dyspepsia patients and healthy people had significant differences in all domains. After treatment, all domains had significant improvements except diet. Item response theory analysis showed the Person separation index of 0.920 and the threshold estimator of items was normally distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.27. The residuals of each item were between -2.5 and 2.5, without statistical significance. Differential item functioning analysis found that items had neither uniform nor non-uniform differential item functioning in different genders and age groups.The Chinese version of FDDQL has good psychometric properties and is suitable for measuring the health status of Chinese patients with functional dyspepsia."
5,HIF1A gene Pro582Ser polymorphism and susceptibility to digestive tract cancers: a meta-analysis of case-control studies.,"Many existing studies have demonstrated that common polymorphisms in the hypoxia inducible factor-1?? (HIF-1A) may contribute to the development of digestive tract cancers, but individually published studies showed inconclusive results. This meta-analysis aimed to derive a precise estimation of the relationships between HIF1A Pro582Ser polymorphism and the risk of digestive tract cancers. We searched CISCOM, CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and CBM databases from inception through May 1, 2013. Meta-analysis was performed using the STATA 12.0 software. We assessed 6 case-control studies that included a total of 911 digestive tract cancer patients and 2774 healthy controls. Our meta-analysis indicated that HIF1A Pro582Ser polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of digestive tract cancer. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity suggested that HIF1A Pro582Ser polymorphism might increase an individual's susceptibility to digestive tract cancer in Asian populations. However, similar association was not observed in Caucasian populations. In conclusion, our findings suggest that HIF1A Pro582Ser polymorphism may contribute to the risk of digestive tract cancers, especially in Asian populations."

5,Factors associated With burnout among French digestive surgeons in training: results of a national survey on 328 residents and fellows.,"Digestive surgery training is notoriously difficult and medical students choose??this path less and less often leading to a veritable demographic crisis for this specialty in France. The aim of this study was to evaluate the working conditions to measure the prevalence of burnout syndrome (BOS) and to identify potential risk factors to implement preventive measures and appropriate support.This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. An anonymous questionnaire was sent by e-mail to 500 French digestive surgeons in training (residents and fellows).The response rate was 65.6%. The mean working week was 75.7??hours (??12) and the mean number of night shifts was 5.3 (??1.6)/month. Sixty-seven percent of respondents had trouble sleeping and 12% reported suicidal thoughts. High-emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment low scores were??observed respectively in 24.7%, 44.6%, and 47%, corresponding to a high score of BOS in 52%.This study showed a high rate of BOS in French digestive surgeons in training and a worrying rate of suicide ideation."
5,[Prognosis of post-operative digestive fistulas in Chu de Yopougon: Abidjan/Cote d'Ivoire].,"Because of the difficulties to manage the post-operative digestive fistulas (FDPO) and their disappointing results, the authors led this survey. It's objective is to identify the prognosis factors in order to optimize their management and improve their prognosis.It is a retrospective survey during 12 years, from January 1992 to December 2004 in the general and digestive surgery adult service of CHU Yopougon. It included 86 files of patients aged of 15 years at least presenting a FDPO.The middle age was of 36.8 years. The death rate was 29.06%. It rose with age. The risk of death was multiplied by 5.54 over age of 55 years (OR = 5.54 and p = 0.012). The number of death rose meaningfully with the length of the diagnostic delay (p = 0.016 for OR1 = 1.64 and OR2 = 8.94. The death rate was raised more in the exposed fistulas that in the controlled fistulas (87% against 45%). In 50% of the cases the death occurred when the debit was superior or equal to 500 cc daily. Among the patients submitted to the medical treatment 69.70% had a spontaneous closing of their fistula in a middle delay of 27.18 days for extremes varying between 13 and 47 days.The affection is very serious considering it's death rate. A precocious diagnosis and a fast and adapted management should permit to reduce this higher mortality."
5,Distribution and linkage of domoic acid (amnesic shellfish poisoning toxins) in subcellular fractions of the digestive gland of the scallop Pecten maximus.,"The king scallop Pecten maximus accumulates domoic acid, the main amnesic shellfish poisoning toxin, in the digestive gland for a long time. To try to find if the cause of this characteristic is the binding of the toxin to some cellular component, the subcellular distribution of domoic acid in the cells of the digestive gland was studied, by means of serial centrifugation, ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Domoic acid was found to be present mostly in soluble form in the cytosol, as more than 90% was found in the supernatant after a centrifugation of 1h at 45,000 x g, and passed a 10 kDa ultrafilter. The retention time of the peak with an absorption maximum of 242 nm--the one characteristic of domoic acid--observed in the SEC chromatograms of the scallop samples was found identical to be one of a reference solution of the toxin, indicating therefore, that domoic acid is free in the cytosol of the digestive gland of Pecten maximus. This finding turns the focus from binding to the lack of membrane transporters in this species of the scallop as the cause of the long retention time of domoic acid in this species."
5,"Digestive efficiencies of Cape white-eyes (Zosterops virens), red-winged starlings (Onychognathus morio) and speckled mousebirds (Colius striatus) fed varying concentrations of equicaloric glucose or sucrose artificial fruit diets.","Digestive physiology is important for understanding the feeding behaviour of organisms. Specifically, studies on the digestive physiology of frugivorous and nectarivorous birds are important for elucidating their preference patterns in the wild and the selective pressures they exert on fruit pulp and nectar. In this study, digesta transit times and digestive efficiencies of three species of birds, the Cape white-eyes (Zosterops virens), red-winged starlings (Onychognathus morio) and speckled mousebirds (Colius striatus) were investigated on equicaloric glucose or sucrose artificial fruit diets. Three concentrations, approximating the natural range of sugar concentrations in sugary, bird-dispersed fruits were used: low (6.6%), medium (12.4%) and high (22%). Digesta transit times of birds increased with an increase in concentration for all diets but were generally higher on glucose diets. Intake rates, on the other hand, decreased with an increase in sugar concentration. All species of birds failed to maintain a constant assimilated energy intake on glucose diets but mousebirds and white-eyes maintained it on sucrose diets. Apparent assimilation efficiencies of glucose diets for all species were comparable and typical of those found in other frugivorous birds. However, assimilation efficiencies for sucrose diets differed widely with red-winged starlings displaying very low assimilation efficiencies and as a consequence; they lost significant body mass on all sucrose diets. These results demonstrate the importance of digestive physiology in explaining fruit selection patterns in frugivorous birds and how a seemingly trivial physiological trait can have dire ecological consequences."
5,Tributyltin-driven enhancement of the DCCD insensitive Mg-ATPase activity in mussel digestive gland mitochondria.,"The lipophilic pollutant tributyltin (TBT), other than inhibiting the DCCD (N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) and oligomycin-sensitive Mg-ATPase activities in digestive gland mitochondria from the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, at higher than 1.0????M concentrations in??vitro promotes an increase in the ATPase activity fraction refractory to inhibitors of F(O) moiety, namely oligomycin and DCCD. By exploring the mechanisms involved in the TBT promoted enzyme desensitization to DCCD, we pointed out intriguing differences in the enzyme desensitization to the two inhibitors. Differently from oligomycin, the TBT promoted enzyme desensitization to DCCD is independent of the redox state of thiol groups of the enzyme complex and strongly temperature dependent, being significantly elicited only at temperatures above the break of the Arrhenius plots (around 18????C). Such differences may cast light on multiple TBT interaction modes with the enzyme complex. The TBT-driven increase in the activation energy of the Mg-ATPase activities insensitive to inhibitors of F(O) sector suggests that the temperature-dependent incorporation of the lipophilic toxicant within the lipid bilayer may deeply affect the membrane-bound complex functionality. Accordingly, incorporated TBT may cause structural changes in the intramembrane F(O) subunits, thus weakening or even preventing DCCD binding to the enzyme complex."
5,Digestive complaints in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing bone marrow transplantation.,"The aim of this study was to assess the severity and frequency of complaints affecting the digestive system in 57 patients with hematological malignancies, who underwent allogeneic (Group I, n = 22) and autologous (Group II, n = 35) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Chemotherapy-related toxicities affecting the digestive system (mucositis, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea) were assessed according to the WHO scale for organ toxicity. Selection of the feeding route (oral or parenteral) depended on the tolerance to oral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition (PN) was introduced when oral intake represented ??? 50% of the total energy requirement over 2 days. PN was started in the third 24-h period. 63.6% of patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation and 54.3% of patients undergoing autologous transplantation needed PN. Ailments affecting the digestive system began in both groups during the administration of conditioning chemotherapy and gradually decreased in the posttransplantation period. Mucositis grade 3/4 requiring PN was observed in 85% patients in Group I and 52.7% patients in Group II. In Group I, grade 3 diarrhea was observed only in patients requiring PN. Severe grade 3/4 organ toxicity from chemotherapy was the main indication for PN in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."
5,Gly388Arg FGFR4 Polymorphism Is Not Predictive of Everolimus Efficacy in Well-Differentiated Digestive Neuroendocrine Tumors.,"Preclinical data suggest that the single nucleotide polymorphism substituting a glycine for an arginine in codon 388 of the FGFR4 transmembrane domain may increase the proliferation of xenografted neuroendocrine cell lines and decrease their sensitivity to everolimus by modulating STAT3 signaling and the mTOR pathway.To evaluate the prognostic and predictive values of this polymorphism on everolimus efficacy in patients treated for digestive neuroendocrine tumor (NET).This monocentric retrospective cohort included patients with small bowel NET (SBNET) and pancreatic NET (PNET) treated with everolimus (2006-2013). The patients were genotyped by classical sequencing, and mTOR pathway activity was assessed by immunochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (PTEN/pPTEN/pAKT/pmTOR/pS6/p4EBP1).Forty-one patients (21 males, median age 57 years) with PNET (n = 28), SBNET (n = 12) or NET of unknown origin (n = 1), grade 1 (n = 8), 2 (n = 27), 3 (n = 3) or unknown grade (n = 3), were studied. At least one 388Arg allele was found in 14/23 PNET and 10/11 SBNET. Progression-free survival in the whole population and the PNET subgroup was not influenced by the presence of one or two 388Arg alleles [HR = 1.31 (0.58-2.99), p = 0.52 and HR = 1.11 (0.45-2.73), p = 0.82, respectively]. Similarly, overall survival was not influenced. Finally, mTOR pathway molecule expression was not modified by the presence of at least one 388Arg allele.The Gly388Arg FGFR4 polymorphism does not seem to have a prognostic value in digestive NET. In addition, it neither predicts the response to everolimus nor modifies the activation of the mTOR pathway."
5,Tributyltin inhibits the oligomycin-sensitive Mg-ATPase activity in Mytilus galloprovincialis digestive gland mitochondria.,"Tributyltin (TBT), widely employed in the past in antifouling paints, is one of the most toxic organic pollutants. Although recently banned, it still threatens coastal water ecosystems and accumulates in filter-feeding molluscs. TBT is known to act as a membrane-active toxicant; however data on mussels are scanty and exposure effects on mitochondrial ATPase activities remain hitherto unexplored. TBT effects on the mitochondrial Mg-ATPase activities in the digestive gland of Mytilus galloprovincialis were investigated both in vitro and in TBT-exposed mussels. Both an oligomycin-sensitive Mg-ATPase (OS Mg-ATPase) (70% of total Mg-ATPase activity) and an oligomycin-insensitive ATPase (OI Mg-ATPase) (30%) were found. The OS-Mg-ATPase was as much as 70% in vitro inhibited by 0.7 ??M (203 ??g/L) TBT, while higher concentrations promoted a partial inhibition release up to 5.0 ??M TBT; higher than 10.0 ??M TBT concentrations yielded nearly complete enzyme inhibition. Concentrations higher than 1 ??M TBT enhanced the OI Mg-ATPase. Mussels exposed to 0.5 and 1.0 ??g/L TBT in aquaria showed a 30% depressed OS Mg-ATPase activity, irrespective of TBT dose and exposure time (24 and 120 h). The OI Mg-ATPase activity was apparently refractory to TBT exposure and halved both in control and TBT-exposed mussels after 120 h exposure."
5,Therapeutic potential of curcumin in digestive diseases.,"Curcumin is a low-molecular-weight hydrophobic polyphenol that is extracted from turmeric, which possesses a wide range of biological properties including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-proliferative and anti-microbial activities. Despite its diverse targets and substantial safety, clinical applications of this molecule for digestive disorders have been largely limited to case series or small clinical trials. The poor bioavailability of curcumin is likely the major hurdle for its more widespread use in humans. However, complexation of curcumin into phytosomes has recently helped to bypass this problem, as it has been demonstrated that this new lecithin formulation enables increased absorption to a level 29-fold higher than that of traditional curcuminoid products. This allows us to achieve much greater tissue substance delivery using significantly lower doses of curcumin than have been used in past clinical studies. As curcumin has already been shown to provide good therapeutic results in some small studies of both inflammatory and neoplastic bowel disorders, it is reasonable to anticipate an even greater efficacy with the advent of this new technology, which remarkably improves its bioavailability. These features are very promising and may represent a novel and effective therapeutic approach to both functional and organic digestive diseases. "
5,Digestive proteolytic and amylolytic activities of Helicoverpa armigera in response to feeding on different soybean cultivars.,"Digestive proteolytic and amylolytic activities of the larvae of Helicoverpa armigera (H??bner) fed either on artificial diet or on different soybean cultivars (356, M4, M7, M9, Clark, Sahar, JK, BP, Williams, L17, Zane, Gorgan3 and DPX) and response of the larvae to feeding on some soybean-based protease inhibitors were studied.The highest general and specific proteolytic activities were in artificial-diet-fed larvae. Although the highest general proteolytic activity was in the larvae fed on L17, M4 and Sahar cultivars, the lowest tryptic activity was on L17 and Sahar, which may be due to the presence of some serine protease inhibitors in these two cultivars, resulting in hyperproduction of chymotrypsin- and elastase-like enzymes in response to the inhibition of these enzymes. The highest amylolytic activity was on M4, and the lowest was on Williams and DPX. General proteolytic activity of SKTI-fed larvae was the highest compared with SBBI- and STI-fed larvae.The findings demonstrated that the cultivars L17 and Sahar were partially resistant to this pest, probably because of some secondary chemicals or proteinaceous protease inhibitors of these cultivars."
5,"[Digestive system neoplasms originating from the autonomic nervous system. Diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic issues].","The gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumors (GAN tumor) are uncommon stromal tumors of the intestinal tract and retroperitoneum. The distinction of GAN tumors from other gastrointestinal stromal tumors is based on electron microscopic findings. However further study of additional cases is needed to fully characterize both their gross and microscopic features and to further characterize the natural history of such tumors. In the present study we report two cases of GAN tumor that arose from the stomach and small intestinal with different prognostic evolution in two patients of 73 and 65 years old. They were both treated by surgery, but only one case was successful. In addition patient 1 aged 73, died 11 months after surgical treatment with liver metastases on CT. scan. Patient 2, is clinically well five years after surgical treatment."
5,"[PEDIATRIC GASTROENTEROLOGY: ORIGINS, PROBLEMS, AND PROSPECTS OF THE RESEARCH].","The nomenclature of digestive diseases in children was supplemented by the ""new"" diseases: of esophagus--gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus, Zenker's diverticulum; of stomach and duodenum--gastroduodenitis, peptic ulcer disease, polyps, ectopic pancreas in the stomach wall; of the intestine--jejunitis, ileocolitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth syndrome in the small intestine; of biliary tract--cholelithiasis, gallbladder cholesterosis, anomalies of the biliary tract; of pancreas--acute and chronic pancreatitis, annular pancreas (2). The features of gastrointestinal diseases in children experiencing the action of factors, not always positively affecting the growing organism, were established. These features include: presence of allergic background; high level of neuro-autonomous and psycho-emotional changes in modern children, not only in schoolchildren, but even in preschoolers; polymorbidity or a combination (syntropy) of lesions of the digestive system; adverse outcomes of certain diseases as chronization, complications development, and as a consequence--a high risk of disability in children; ""rejuvenation"" of certain diseases of the digestive system (cholelithiasis, gallbladder cholesterosis, Crohn's disease), typical for adults. It is important to emphasize the clinical and social importance of gastroenterological diseases in childhood. Axiomatic is that the origins of many diseases of the digestive organs in adults lie in childhood. Early manifestation of certain diseases such as peptic ulcer disease, gluten enteropathy, Crohn's disease, and others, significantly impact the quality of life of sick children and their parents. It is worth to emphasize high costs of medical and prophylactic (tertiary prevention) activities using the drugs of latest generations. All this causes problems in both applied and scientific pediatric gastroenterology."
5,5-HT<sub>3A</sub> serotonin receptor in the gastrointestinal tract: the link between immune system and enteric nervous system in the digestive form of Chagas disease.,"Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and remains one of the most neglected diseases in Latin America. One of its clinical forms is Chagas megacolon. Despite being known for more than half a century, detailed causes are still obscure. Recent evidence indicates a close relationship between the immune system and the enteric nervous system in the etiology of chagasic megacolon pathology. It is believed that low expression of the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> serotonin receptor on lymphocytes could be linked to megacolon development. To test this hypothesis, this work investigated the distribution of CD4, CD8, and CD20 lymphocytes and their 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> receptor expression. The results demonstrated that Chagas patients without megacolon present a higher expression of the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> receptor in all analyzed lymphocytes compared with Chagas patients with megacolon. These data suggest that the high expression of this receptor may lead to immunomodulation and prevent the development of Chagas megacolon."
5,[Monoamine- and peptide-containing elements in the nemertine digestive tract].,"Detailed comparative-histological data on localization and morphological peculiarities of catecholamine-, serotonin-, neurotensin- and FMRFamide-containing elements in the nemertine digestive system are presented for the first time. Using fluorescent histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, pharynx, esophagus, and midgut were studied in five species from three genera of the White Sea nemertines. Described in various nemertine species are intra- and subepithelial cells of the open and closed type, containing biologically active substances. Their processes are distributed in basi- and subepithelial nerve plexuses and can make contact with lumen of the digestive tract. Species-specificity in localization of the cells containing certain biologically active substances is noticed both along the length of the tract and with respect to its epithelial layer. Peculiarities and common regularities in distribution are discussed, as well as a possible function of monoamine- and peptide-containing elements in the digestive tract of the studied nemertines and other invertebrates."
5,Histopathology and microcystin distribution in Lymnaea stagnalis (Gastropoda) following toxic cyanobacterial or dissolved microcystin-LR exposure.,"The accumulation of hepatotoxic microcystins (MCs) in gastropods has been demonstrated to be higher following grazing of toxic cyanobacteria than from MCs dissolved in ambient water. Previous studies, however, did not adequately consider MCs covalently bound to protein phosphatases, which may represent a considerably part of the MC body burden. Thus, using an immunohistochemical method, we examined and compared the histopathology and organ distribution of covalently bound MCs in Lymnaea stagnalis following a 5-week exposure to (i) dmMC-LR, dmMC-RR, and MC-YR-producing Planktothrix agardhii (5 microg MC-LReqL(-1)) and (ii) dissolved MC-LR (33 and 100 microgL(-1)). A subsequent 3-week depuration investigated potential MC elimination and tissue regeneration. Following both exposures, bound MCs were primarily observed in the digestive gland and tract of L. stagnalis. Snails exposed to toxic cyanobacteria showed severe and widespread necrotic changes in the digestive gland co-occurring with a pronounced cytoplasmic presence of MCs in digestive cells and in the lumen of digestive lobules. Snails exposed to dissolved MC-LR showed moderate and negligible pathological changes of the digestive gland co-occurring with a restrained presence of MCs in the apical membrane of digestive cells and in the lumen of digestive lobules. These results confirm lower uptake of dissolved MC-LR and correspondingly lower cytotoxicity in the digestive gland of L. stagnalis. In contrast, after ingestion of MC-containing cyanobacterial filaments, the most likely longer residual time within the digestive gland and/or the MC variant involved (e.g., MC-YR) allowed for increased MC uptake, consequently a higher MC burden in situ and thus a more pronounced ensuing pathology. While no pathological changes were observed in kidney, foot and the genital gland, MCs were detected in spermatozoids and oocytes of all exposed snails, most likely involving a hemolymph transport from the digestive system to the genital gland. The latter results indicate the potential for adverse impact of MCs on gastropod health and reproduction as well as the possible transfer of MCs to higher trophic levels of the food web."
5,[Metal accumulation and MTLP induction in the digestive glands of Perna viridis exposed to Cu].,"Mussels have been proposed as appropriate biomonitors of marine pollution, especially for monitoring metallic pollution based on variations of metallothionein as biomarkers. Under 2 exposure levels (12.7 microg/L, 63.5 microg/L), Cu accumulation and metallothionein-like protein (MTLP) induction by mussel (Perna viridis) digestive glands were investigated and simulated into dynamic models in the present work, and the soluble and total Cu burden of digestive glands were also determined. Calculated mean Cu uptake rates by mussel target organ were 2.045 and 7.028 microg x (g x d)(-1) respectively, and the theoretical equilibrium kinetic BCFs of Cu were 2074 and 1619 correspondingly. And within the exposure duration, different changing trends of ratio of soluble Cu to total Cu in digestive glands were observed in the two groups. The MTLP level of control samples was (0.551 +/- 0.037) mg/g, and the counterparts are 0.407 - 0.699 mg/g, 0.826 - 0.942 mg/g respectively when mussels were exposed to 12.7 microg/L and 63.5 microg/L Cu solutions. Statistically significant MTLP induction (p < 0.001) was observed under higher exposure level. MTLP contents in digestive glands increased with the exposure Cu concentration and body accumulation of metal. There is a significantly negative exponential rise relationship (p < 0.000 1) between MTLP and Cu concentrations accumulated in the digestive glands of mussels."
5,Demonstration and immunolocalization of ATP diphosphohydrolase in the pig digestive system.,"Two isoforms of ATP diphosphohydrolase (ATPDase; EC 3.6.1.5) have been previously characterized, purified, and identified. This enzyme is an ectonucleotidase that catalyzes the sequential release of gamma- and beta-phosphate groups of triphospho- and diphosphonucleosides. One of its putative roles is to modulate the extracellular concentrations of purines in different physiological systems. The purpose of this study was to define, identify, and localize these two isoforms of ATPDase in the pig digestive system. ATPDase activity was measured in pig stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and parotid gland. Enzyme assays, electrophoretograms, and Western blots with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both isoforms demonstrate the presence of ATPDase in these organs. Immunolocalization showed intense reactions with gastric glands (parietal and chief cells), intestine (columnar epithelial cells), parotid gland, and pancreas. Smooth muscle cells all along the digestive tract were also highly reactive. Considering the variety of purinoceptors associated with the digestive system, the ATPDase is strategically positioned to modulate purine-mediated actions such as electrolyte secretion, glandular secretion, smooth muscle contraction, and blood flow."
5,Oral and I.V. contrast enhanced ultrasonography of the digestive tract--a useful completion of the B-mode examination: a literature review and an exhaustive illustration through images.,"Contrast enhanced ultrasonography, using i.v. and/or oral/rectal contrast agents, represents a technical development of the US method, which has proved its applicability in the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the normal and pathological circulatory bed, as well as of the digestive lumen. The use of microbubbles and harmonics opens a new horizon in the detection and characterization of the inflammatory and tumoral conditions of the digestive tract. The interpretation of the data requires corroboration with the grey scale aspect of the examined lesion/area, as well as with the clinical context of the case and the results of other diagnosis techniques. The purpose of this paper is to review the main applications of CEUS in digestive tract pathology by analyzing the significant literature and guidelines in the light of our personal experience and demonstrating it through suggestive images. "
5,Selective decontamination of the digestive tract in gastrointestinal surgery: useful in infection prevention? A systematic review.,"Gastrointestinal surgery is associated with a high incidence of infectious complications. Selective decontamination of the digestive tract is an antimicrobial prophylaxis regimen that aims to eradicate gastrointestinal carriage of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and represents an adjunct to regular prophylaxis in surgery.Relevant studies were identified using bibliographic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database (period from 1970 to November 1, 2012). Only studies investigating selective decontamination of the digestive tract in gastrointestinal surgery were included.Two randomized clinical trials and one retrospective case-control trial showed significant benefit in terms of infectious complications and anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery. Two randomized controlled trials in esophageal surgery and two randomized clinical trials in gastric surgery reported lower levels of infectious complications.Selective decontamination of the digestive tract reduces infections following esophageal, gastric, and colorectal surgeries and also appears to have beneficial effects on anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery. We believe these results provide the basis for a large multicenter prospective study to investigate the role of selective decontamination of the digestive tract in colorectal surgery."
5,[Morpho-functional status of the hypophysial-thyroidal system in patients with functional disorders of the digestive tract].,"The author has studied the character and frequency of changes of the hypophysial- thyroidal system in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric dyspepsia and biliary dyskinesia in young patients aged 15-30 years. The analysis of neuroendocrine disorders, common pathogenetic aspects of the development of functional pathology of the digestive tract were carried out. It made possible to draw a conclusions concerning the right correction of these conditions."
5,Ultrastructure of the larval midgut of Bittacus planus (Mecoptera: Bittacidae) and Neopanorpa longiprocessa (Mecoptera: Panorpidae).,"Bittacidae and Panorpidae are the two largest families in Mecoptera. The larvae of Bittacidae are different from those of Panorpidae in external morphology and habits, and have an interesting habit of spraying the body surface with soil through the anus. However, it remains unknown to date whether the larval midguts are different in structure between the two families. Here the ultrastructure of the larval midguts of the hangingfly Bittacus planus Cheng and the scorpionfly Neopanorpa longiprocessa Hua & Chou were compared using light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. The midguts of both species are simple tubes of single layered epithelia with digestive and regenerative cells but without diverticula. The basal plasma membrane of epithelial cells exhibits infolding in B. planus, but is closely apposed to its basal lamina in N. longiprocessa. Lymph spaces are present between adjacent epithelial cells in B. planus, but are absent in N. longiprocessa. The regenerative cells are scattered among the digestive cells in B. planus, but are aggregated in N. longiprocessa. The longitudinal muscle bands are compact in B. planus, but are sparse in N. longiprocessa. The compact longitudinal muscle bands are likely associated with their soil-spraying habit in Bittacidae."
5,"Dinotefuran-induced morphophysiological changes in semi-engorged females Rhipicephalus sanguineus Latreille, 1806 (Acari: Ixodidae) ticks: Ultra-structural evaluation.","The present study demonstrated the effects of dinotefuran (active ingredient of the acaricide Protetor Pet<sup>??</sup>) on the ovary and midgut cells of semi engorged R. sanguineus females exposed to different concentrations of this chemical. For this, 120 semi-engorged females were divided into four treatment groups with 30 individuals each: group I or control (distilled water), group II (5000ppm), groups III (6250ppm) and group IV (8334ppm of dinotefuran). All the ticks were immersed in the different concentrations of dinotefuran or in distilled water for 5min and then dried and kept in BOD incubator for 7days. The results showed alterations mainly regarding the damaged cell structures, such as yolk granules, organelles and the plasma membrane of the germ cells. In addition, structures related with defense mechanisms were found, such as vacuoles, cytoskeletal filaments, and myelin figures in the germ cells. Damages in the generative cells of the midgut, alterations in the size of digestive cells, the number of endosomes, digestive vacuoles, digestive residues, lipid drops and organelles in the cytoplasm of the digestive cells and the presence of microvilli in the plasma membrane of these cells also demonstrate the progressive damages caused by the action of dinotefuran in the midgut and germ cells of R. sanguineus semi-engorged females. The concentrations applied partially impaired the digestive processes; and, without proper nutrition, all the ectoparasite's physiologic events are prevented from occurring, leading the individual to death. The germ cells were also damaged, and probably would not be able to advance in their development (I-V) and complete the vitellogenesis, which would affect the fertility of the female and consequently impede the formation of a new individual."
5,Efficacy and Safety of the Over-the-Scope Clip (OTSC) System in the Management of Leak and Fistula After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Systematic Review.,"Endoscopic management of leaks/fistulas after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gaining popularity in the bariatric surgery.This study aimed to review the efficacy and safety of over-the-scope-clip (OTSC) system in endoscopic closure of post-LSG leak/fistula.PubMed/Medline and major journals of the field were systematically reviewed for studies on endoscopic closure of post-LSG leaks/fistula by means of the OTSC system.A total of ten eligible studies including 195 patients with post-LSG leaks/fistula were identified. The time between LSG and leak/fistula ranged from 1??day to 803??days. Most of the leaks/fistula were located at the proximal staple line, and they sized from 3 to 20??mm. Time between leak diagnosis and OTSC clipping ranged from 0 to 271??days. Thirty-three out of 53 patients (63.5%) required one clip for closure of the lesion. Regarding the OTSC-related complications, a leak occurred in five patients (9.3%) and OTSC migration, stenosis, and tear each in one patient (1.8%). Of the 73 patients with post-LSG leak treated with OTSC, 63 patients had an overall successful closure (86.3%).OTSC system is a promising endoscopic approach for management of post-LSG leaks in appropriately selected patients. Unfortunately, most studies are series with a small sample size, short-term follow-up, and mixed data of concomitant procedures with OTSC. Further studies should distinguish the net efficacy of the OTSC system from other concomitant procedures in treatment of post-LSG leak."
5,The self-evaluation of upper-gastrointestinal symptoms in Chinese patients with digestive disease: A multicenter questionnaire survey.,"To investigate the self-evaluation of upper gastrointestinal symptoms in Chinese patients. To observe the role of patients' characters, such as sex, age, education background, and clinic visits, which might affect the self-understanding of patients.The nationwide cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to 3000 patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms at 50 hospitals across 9 provinces in China. Questionnaire items covered four basic patients' characters and five major upper gastrointestinal symptoms.A total of 2799 questionnaires (response rate: 93.3%) were analyzed. Only 35.29% patients could precisely understand the definition of dyspepsia. The misunderstanding of lower-gastroenterology discomforts is the major reason leading to low accuracy rate of dyspepsia. The accuracy rate of early satiety and postprandial fullness is 37.7% and 52.27% separately; they are most interrelated and easily confused concepts to each other. The accuracy rate of heartburn is 30.02%, while the location of burning sensation is the key aspect for misunderstanding of heartburn. The self-understanding of symptoms in patients was decreased with increasing age, and enhanced with higher education background and time of clinic visits. Gender is not the independent factor.Based on the low accuracy rate of self-understanding of patients, this survey suggests that the gastroenterologists should re-evaluate the symptoms of patients during the clinical inquiry."
5,Digestive Tract Complications of Renal Cryoablation.,"We report a case each of duodenorenal and colorenal fistula that arose after computed tomography-guided percutaneous cryoablation (PCA) for renal cell carcinoma and use imaging and endoscopic findings to analyze their causes and mechanisms. Both complications occurred though the edge of the iceball did not touch the intestinal wall, and patients' symptoms and fistula formation occurred several days after the PCA procedure. Based on imaging and endoscopy findings, we suspected the colorenal fistula resulted from bowel injury caused by ischemia from the occlusion of small vessels at the procedure's low temperature. Both cases were resolved conservatively without surgical intervention."
5,Survival from digestive cancer in emerging countries in Asia and Africa.,"The incidence of digestive cancer, including cancer of the esophagus, stomach, colon, and liver, is analyzed in developing and less developed countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America. The analysis is based on cancer registries for observed values, on a recent monograph published at International Agency for Research on Cancer and on the GLOBOCAN 2008 database for estimations. For all tumor sites analyzed, the incidence is lower in these countries than in developed countries of Europe, North America, and Japan. The 5-year relative survival from digestive cancer is also lower. In developing countries, there is room for prevention of cancer burden through lifestyle interventions and through improved early detection of cancer."
5,Unusual clinical course of metachronous melanomas of the upper digestive system.,"Melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract is a rare, highly malignant neoplasm of poor prognosis. This is description of an unusual case of surgically treated patient with two metachronous malignant melanomas of the stomach and the esophagus. The former lesion was located in the cardia and effectively treated with R0 total gastrectomy. The latter was recognized after 67 mo and appeared as irregular, flat, pigmented areas located in the mid esophagus. Subtotal esophagectomy via right-sided thoracotomy, laparotomy and left-sided cervicotomy was performed, but neoplastic cells were found in distal margin (R1). Fourteen months after esophagectomy multiple lung metastases were detected. Patient died 2 mo later."
5,[Digestive system diseases and style of nutrition among secondary school students].,"In the paper there was examined 246 pupils from secondary school. The auditorial survey including 23 questions was drawn up. The questions referred to digestive diseases occurrence among members of family, pupils under the survey, their style of nutrition, financial status of their family. It was interesting how kind of food, keeping regular hours, behaviour during eating is connected with frequency of digestive disease occurrence. 14.5% of pupils suffered from alimentary tract diseases especially constipation and peptic ulcer. A large percentage (46.2%) do not eat regularly, and 85% is in a hurry, doing something else during eating. 39.4% of examined use spices, ketchup, mustard every time, 17.5% do not eat vegetables, fruit at all, 45.9% eat sweets every day. Before leaving for school 45.9% pupils do not even eat breakfast. 69.1% of subjects claimed that stress is a reason of occurence their digestive disorders. In the paper abnormal style of nutrition is more frequent among pupils complaining of digestive system diseases."
5,Digestive recovery of sulfur-methyl-L-methionine and its bioaccessibility in Kimchi cabbages using a simulated in vitro digestion model system.,"Sulfur-methyl-L-methionine (SMM) has been known to provide various biological functions such as radical scavenging effect, inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, and prevention of gastric mucosal damage. Kimchi cabbages are known to be a major food source providing SMM but its bioaccessibility has not been studied. The objective of current study was to determine both the digestive stability of SMM and the amount released from Kimchi cabbages under a simulated in vitro digestion model system.The in vitro digestion model system simulating a human gastrointestinal tract was carried out for measuring digestive recovery and bioaccessibility of SMM. SMM was quantified by using high-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector. Recovery of an SMM standard after digestion was 0.68 and 0.65% for fasted and fed conditions, respectively, indicating that the digestive stability of the SMM standard was not affected by dietary energy or co-ingested food matrix. The SMM standard was also significantly stable in acidic pH (P < 0.05). The bioaccessibility of SMM from Kimchi cabbages was measured under a fasted condition, resulted in 8.83, 14.71 and 10.88%, for salivary, gastric and small intestinal phases, respectively.Results from our study suggest that SMM from Kimchi cabbages, a component of food sources, is more bioavailable than SMM by itself."
5,"Proceedings of a preliminary workshop at Gastro 2009--narrow banding imaging in digestive endoscopy: clinical outcome of classification (Omed-Jges Educational Meeting held on 22 November, 2009).","This publication reports the proceedings of the preliminary meeting of the working party that met at Gastro 2009 during the World Congress in London. The purpose of the preliminary meeting was to consider the areas that require attention, to discuss some of the findings that have already been published and to agree on the way forward. Our reason for publishing these proceedings is to stimulate interest in this venture and to provide the opportunity for input from the endoscopy community worldwide. The next meeting of the working party will be at the JGES Society meeting in Aomori in April 2011 when we hope to prepare a preliminary classification. This will be presented for general discussion and debate at the International Congress of Endoscopy (ICE) in Los Angeles in September 2011."
5,Effect of autoimmune diseases on mortality and survival in subsequent digestive tract cancers.,"Patients with some autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are at increased risk of cancer, possibly a result of an underlying dysregulation of the immune system, medication, treatment or, probably, surveillance bias. Data on cancer mortality and survival in patients previously diagnosed with AIDs would provide novel information on these comorbidities and their clinical implications.Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for subsequent deaths from seven digestive tract cancers between 1964 and 2008 in patients hospitalized for any of 33 AIDs.There were 33 increased SMRs for specific cancers after a defined AID; similarly, 21 HRs were increased. Both the SMR and HR were increased after 10 autoimmune disorders, including pernicious anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis. Increased SMRs and unchanged HRs were noted for 23 cancers. Myasthenia gravis was associated with SMRs for five cancers but no increases in HRs. For nine cancers, including esophageal cancer after ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis, the SMR was unchanged but the HR increased.The increases in SMRs provide evidence that cancer risks were truly increased and largely unaffected by surveillance bias. The prognostic survival data should contribute to clinical evaluation and therapeutic planning."
5,Autoimmune disease and subsequent digestive tract cancer by histology.,"Dysregulation of the immune function in autoimmune diseases could potentially lead to cancer development and there is definite evidence linking some autoimmune mechanisms with cancer. We analyzed systematically the occurrence of histology-specific digestive tract cancers in patients diagnosed with 33 different autoimmune diseases in order to address the question of shared susceptibility.Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for subsequent digestive tract cancers up to the year 2008 and in patients hospitalized for autoimmune disease after the year 1964.Myasthenia gravis associated with five different cancers with SIRs ranging from 1.35 to 2.78. Pernicious anemia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosis and psoriasis were also associated with cancers at multiple sites. Rheumatoid arthritis associated with no cancer and the standardized incidence ratio was decreased for colon adenocarcinoma, also in ankylosing spondylitis patients.Increased risks of cancer were observed in patients with several autoimmune diseases. Myasthenia gravis and pernicious anemia were associated with many cancers; this is possibly related to immunosuppressant medication in myasthenia gravis. The decreased risks in colon and rectal adenocarcinomas in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis suggest underlying inflammatory mechanisms as the risks may have been suppressed by the use of anti-inflammatory medication."
5,[Hemorrhagic shock revealing multiple digestive microaneurysms in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: Case report and literature review].,"The vascular disorders in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) result from various mechanisms and presentations (inflammatory disease or vasculitis, atherosclerosis).We report on a 34-year-old man with cutaneous, articular, neurological and nephrologic SLE. He presented with catastrophic haemorrhage on microaneurysm rupture of the left hepatic artery. After blood transfusions and immunosuppressive treatments, his condition improves.Uncommon complication in SLE patients, digestive vasculitis with microaneurysms may occur as in polyarteritis nodosa. In the literature, we identified 10 additional cases of hepatic microaneurysms in SLE patients. The main issue is an earlier diagnosis in order to give appropriate treatment and improve prognosis."
5,Modeling intestinal disorders using zebrafish.,"Although the zebrafish was initially developed as a model system to study embryonic development, it has gained increasing attention as an advantageous system to investigate human diseases, including intestinal disorders. Zebrafish embryos develop rapidly, and their digestive system is fully functional and visible by 5days post fertilization. There is a large degree of homology between the intestine of zebrafish and higher vertebrate organisms in terms of its cellular composition and function as both a digestive and immune organ. Furthermore, molecular pathways regulating injury and immune responses are highly conserved. In this chapter, we provide an overview of studies addressing developmental and physiological processes relevant to human intestinal disease. These studies include those related to congenital disorders, host-microbiota interactions, inflammatory diseases, motility disorders, and intestinal cancer. We also highlight the utility of zebrafish to functionally validate candidate genes identified through mutational analyses and genome-wide association studies, and discuss methodologies to investigate the intestinal biology that are unique to zebrafish."
5,"Immunohistochemical detection of alpha1E voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel isoforms in cerebellum, INS-1 cells, and neuroendocrine cells of the digestive system.","Polyclonal antibodies were raised against a common and a specific epitope present only in longer alpha1E isoforms of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, yielding an ""anti-E-com"" and an ""anti-E-spec"" serum, respectively. The specificity of both sera was established by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting using stably transfected HEK-293 cells or membrane proteins derived from them. Cells from the insulinoma cell line INS-1, tissue sections from cerebellum, and representative regions of gastrointestinal tract were stained immunocytochemically. INS-1 cells expressed an alpha1E splice variant with a longer carboxy terminus, the so-called alpha1Ee isoform. Similarily, in rat cerebellum, which was used as a reference system, the anti-E-spec serum stained somata and dendrites of Purkinje cells. Only faint staining was seen throughout the cerebellar granule cell layer. After prolonged incubation times, neurons of the molecular layer were stained by anti-E-com, suggesting that a shorter alpha1E isoform is expressed at a lower protein density. In human gastrointestinal tract, endocrine cells of the antral mucosa (stomach), small and large intestine, and islets of Langerhans were stained by the anti-E-spec serum. In addition, staining by the anti-E-spec serum was observed in Paneth cells and in the smooth muscle cell layer of the lamina muscularis mucosae. We conclude that the longer alpha1Ee isoform is expressed in neuroendocrine cells of the digestive system and that, in pancreas, alpha1Ee expression is restricted to the neuroendocrine part, the islets of Langerhans. alpha1E therefore appears to be a common voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel linked to neuroendocrine and related systems of the body."
5,[History of mechanical sutures in digestive system surgery].,"The attempts to suture wounds with mechanical device are very old, and their history is lost in the night of times. But more recently--that means less than two century ago--already before the true initial beginning of the modern surgery, after the birth of anaesthesiology with the ""ether day--16 october 1846"" there have been many efforts to develop new methods to join the tissue of the gut avoiding the danger of peritoneal contamination. The primitive tools of these ancient stapler were founded on the principle to compress with mechanical devices the two sides of the tissue to join. Very early in the past century, well before the appearance of the antibiotics, in the heart of the old Europe were developed and perfectionated devices able to join the intestinal tissue with metallic stitches: the primitive staplers. But after the end of the second world war the development has become bursting, with the progress of the Sovietic Institute of experimental research on surgical tools of Moscow and then with the mighty initiatives of the industrial power in the USA. The more important progress in this field was founded on the standardization of tools designed to fix metallic stitches on the gut, but very recently there are new attempts to use the more old principle of compression-suture on new basis. The results of this development, essential for modern surgery, are the standardization of the surgical technique, the shortening of operative times, and an important support to the new mininvasive approach to digestive surgery."
5,The miR-146a rs2910164 G > C polymorphism and susceptibility to digestive cancer in Chinese.,"Several studies have reported the role of the miR-146a rs2910164 G > C polymorphism as a susceptibility factor for several digestive cancers. However, the results have been controversial. Therefore, we conducted the present meta-analysis to obtain the most reliable estimate of the association.PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and pooled to assess the strength of the association between miR-146a rs2910164 G > C polymorphism and digestive cancer risk. A total of four eligible studies including 3,447 cases and 5,041 controls based on the search criteria were included.We observed that miR-146a rs2910164 G > C polymorphism was not significantly correlated with digestive cancer risks when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. While we found that miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism was not associated with gastric cancer, it was significantly linked with hepatocellular cancer risk (the homozygote codominant model: OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.04-1.87). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, significant associations were observed in Chinese population for the allele contrast model (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.12-1.38), for the homozygote codominant model (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.28-2.04), and for the recessive model (OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.16-1.64). However, studies with Asian groups presented no significant association for all genetic models.This meta-analysis suggests that the miR-146a rs2910164 G > C polymorphism is a low-penetrant risk factor for digestive cancers in Chinese."
5,Effect of Environmental Pollutant Mixtures on Acid DNase Activity in Mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis: Ex Situ and In Situ Study.,"Acid DNase activity in marine organisms displays a sensitive response to pollutants. In the present study, ex situ effect of toxic seawater organic extracts (Rijeka, Vranjic, Plo??e) and in situ impact of environmental factors at referent (St. Andrew) and a polluted site (ACI Rovinj) on acid DNase in the digestive gland and gills of mussels was investigated. In the digestive gland, enzyme activity was related to potential toxicity of seawater organic extracts. Seawater organic extracts showed an increase of the enzyme activity in digestive gland following exposure. In in situ study, polluted environment affected mussel's acid DNase activity in digestive gland, when compared to gills. Acid DNase activity in the digestive gland expressed significant difference between the referent and polluted site, particularly from early spring through summer. Both ex situ and in situ studies displayed more sensitive acid DNase response to the presence of toxic mixtures in the digestive gland."
5,NANOG: a promising target for digestive malignant tumors.,"NANOG has been extensively researched since its discovery by Chambers et al. NANOG is a homeodomain transcription factor and an essential regulator of embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal, which inhibits differentiation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subset of cells that are thought to drive uncontrolled tumor growth; CSCs retain the tumor capabilities of self-renewal and propagation. The existence of CSCs was recently shown by direct experimental evidence. NANOG is expressed in CSCs and ESCs, although it remains unclear whether ESCs and CSCs share similar mechanisms in the regulation of physical and biological processes. Several studies suggest that the expression level of NANOG is high in cancer tissues and low or absent in normal tissues. High levels of NANOG expression are associated with advanced stages of cancer and a poor prognosis, indicating that it plays a vital role in tumor transformation, tumorigenesis, and tumor metastasis. NANOG is part of a complex regulatory network that controls cell fate determination, proliferation, and apoptosis. NANOG cooperates with other regulators, such as microflora, transcription factors, and kinases, in cancer cells. NANOG might have a promising future in anti-cancer and other therapeutic treatments, which could improve human health."
5,Proteophosphoglycan confers resistance of Leishmania major to midgut digestive enzymes induced by blood feeding in vector sand flies.,"Leishmania synthesize abundant phosphoglycan-containing molecules made up of [Gal-Man-PO(4)] repeating units, including the surface lipophosphoglycan (LPG), and the surface and secreted proteophosphoglycan (PPG). The vector competence of Phlebotomus duboscqi and Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies was tested using L. major knockout mutants deficient in either total phosphoglycans (lpg2(-) or lpg5A(-)/5B(-)) or LPG alone (lpg1(-)) along with their respective gene add-back controls. Our results confirm that LPG, the major cell surface molecule of Leishmania promastigotes known to mediate attachment to the vector midgut, is necessary to prevent the loss of infection during excretion of the blood meal remnants from a natural vector, P. duboscqi, but not an unnatural vector, L. longipalpis. Midgut digestive enzymes induced by blood feeding pose another potential barrier to parasite survival. Our results show that 36-72 h after the infective feed, all parasites developed well except the lpg2(-) and lpg5A(-)/5B(-) mutants, which showed significantly reduced survival and growth. Protease inhibitors promoted the early survival and growth of lpg2(-) in the blood meal. PPG was shown to be the key molecule conferring resistance to midgut digestive enzymes, as it prevented killing of lpg2(-) promastigotes exposed to midgut lysates prepared from blood-fed flies. The protection was not associated with inhibition of enzyme activities, but with cell surface acquisition of the PPG, which appears to function similar to mammalian mucins to protect the surface of developing promastigotes against proteolytic damage."
5,Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubules Induce Pathological Changes in the Digestive Organs of Mice.,"We studied the effects of regular long-term exposure to industrial nanomaterial based on multiwalled carbon nanotubules on the digestive system of mice. Nanomaterial in a concentration of 30 mg/kg was administered with drinking water over 30 days. Tissue specimens from the small intestine and liver were studied by light and electron microscopy. Multiwalled carbon nanotubules caused multiple necrotic foci in the small intestine and mixed parenchymatous degeneration in the liver. These findings suggested that multiwalled carbon nanotubules entering the digestive tract damaged intestinal villi, presumably via mechanical damage to enterocytes. It seems that multiwalled carbon nanotubules could cause degeneration indirectly, by triggering inflammatory reactions and ROS generation. "
5,Wound and methyl jasmonate induced pigeon pea defensive proteinase inhibitor has potency to inhibit insect digestive proteinases.,Wounding of plants by chewing insects or other damage induces the synthesis of defensive proteinase inhibitors (PI) in both wounded and distal unwounded leaves. In the present paper we report the characterization of inducible defensive PI from pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and its in vitro interaction with Helicoverpa armigera gut proteinases (HGP). We found that PI activity was induced in local as well as systemic leaves of pigeon pea by the wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) application. Consistent induction of PI was observed in two wild cultivars of pigeon pea at various growth stages. The estimated molecular weight of inducible PI was ~16.5 kDa. Electrophoretic analysis and enzyme assays revealed that the induced PI significantly inhibited total gut proteinase as well as trypsin-like activity from the midgut of H. armigera. The induced PI was found to be inhibitor of trypsin as well as chymotrypsin. Study could be important to know the further roles of defensive PIs.
5,Elemental profiles of freshwater mussels treated with silver nanoparticles: A metallomic approach.,"Nanoparticles released into the environment could pose a risk to resident organisms that feed on suspended particles in aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of silver nanoparticles (nanoAg) of different sizes in freshwater mussels using a multi-elemental (metallomic) approach in order to determine signature effects of nanoparticulate and ionic Ag. Mussels were exposed to three concentrations (0.8, 4 and 20??g/L) of 20-nm and 80-nm nanoAg and AgNO3 for 48h at 15??C. After the exposure period, mussels were placed in clean, aerated water for a depuration step and analyzed for the following total elements in gill, digestive gland and gonad tissues: Al, Ag, As, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Pb, Na, Ni, Se, Sr, Th, U, V and Zn. Metallothioneins (MT; digestive gland only) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were also determined in gills, digestive glands and gonads. The 20-nm-diameter nanoAg was detected in all three tissues at 20??g/L, while the 80-nm nanoAg was detected more strongly in the digestive gland. Ionic Ag was found at higher levels in gills than in other tissues. Correlation analysis revealed that gonad Ag levels were significantly correlated with Al (r=0.28), V (r=0.28), Cr (r=0.31), Co (r=0.32), Se (r=0.34) and MT levels (r=0.28). Indeed, the MT levels in the digestive gland were significantly increased by 20-nm nanoAg (20??g/L) and 80-nm nanoAg (4??g/L) and AgNO3 (<0.8??g/L). LPO was observed in gills, digestive glands and even gonads for all Ag forms. Discriminant function analysis revealed that all forms of Ag differed from each other and from unexposed mussels, where ionic Ag was more closely related to the 80-nm-diameter nanoAg. Factorial analysis revealed that Ba, Ca, Co, Mn, Sr, U and Zn had consistently high factorial weights in all tissues; that explained 80% of the total variance. Moreover, the following elements showed strong correlations (r>0.7) with each other: Sr, Ba, Zn, Ca, Mg Cr, Mn and U. Comparisons of these elements with other elements showing low or no correlations (e.g., transition elements) revealed that these elements had significantly lower standard reduction potential and electronegativity, suggesting that stronger reducing elements were most influenced by the oxidizing effects of nanoAg and ionic Ag in tissues. Indeed, tissues with oxidative stress (LPO) had decreased levels for most of these reducing elements. We conclude that exposure to Ag nanoparticles produces a characteristic change in the elemental composition of gills, digestive gland and gonad tissues in freshwater mussels. Elements most responsive to oxidative stress were more influenced by both nanoAg and ionic Ag. Sr and Ba were readily decreased by Ag and appeared to respond more sensitively to nanoAg than to ionic Ag. The metallomic approach could contribute in the understanding of fundamental mode of action of nanoparticles in mussels. "
5,Increase in digestive organs of rats due to the ingestion of dietary fiber with similar solubility to that of common bean.,"The aim of the present work is to study the effect of dietary dietary fiber of similar solubility to that of the cooked common bean in the increase of the small intestine, liver, and pancreas of rats. Recently weaned male Wistar rats were fed ad libitum balanced diets containing cooked common bean (12.9% of dietary fiber plus resistant starch) or casein with 5.0% (control group), 10.0%, 12.5% or 15.0% of dietary fiber plus resistant starch added, with the same proportions of insoluble and soluble fibers and resistant starch found in bean (8:3:1) for 14 days. Weight gain and diet intake were smaller in the group fed the cooked bean diet. However, this group showed the highest increase in the studied organs. Rats that ingested the diet containing casein with 15.0% of dietary fiber added showed a growth of 21.4% in the pancreas. Rats fed other casein diets did not show significant differences (p > 0.05). The diet containing the cooked common bean led to weight gain of all studied organs (50.0% in the pancreas, 25.0% in the liver and 33.4% in the small intestine) and an increase of 47.1% in the small intestine length. Therefore, dietary fiber plus resistant starch had a trophic effect on digestive organs, although they were not the only stimulation factor, because the cooked bean has other chemical components, like phytates and tannins, that probably contribute to that effect."
5,Digestive diseases mimicking primary gynecological diseases or with secondary gynecological manifestations.,"A wide range of gastrointestinal diseases may spread to and involve genital organs by different pathways. These pathways result in extension of the pathological process into the extraperitoneal spaces and between the extra- and intraperitoneal spaces. These communications occur either via mesenteries and ligaments or via the posterior parietal peritoneum. Thus, infectious, inflammatory or tumoral digestive diseases can extend into the pelvic organs and present with a misleading clinical picture and/or radiological features, showing the complexity of pelvic diseases in women. This article reviews, illustrates and discusses these different presentations and provides certain clues to help reach a definite diagnosis. "
5,A Fish-Eating Enantiornithine Bird from the Early Cretaceous of China Provides Evidence of Modern Avian Digestive Features.,"Modern birds differ from their theropod ancestors in lacking teeth and heavily constructed bony jaws, having evolved a lightly built beak and a specialized digestive system capable of processing unmasticated food [1, 2]. Enantiornithes, the most successful clade of Mesozoic birds, represents the sister group of the Ornithuromorpha, which gave rise to living birds [3]. Nevertheless, the feeding habits of enantiornithines have remained unknown because of a lack of fossil evidence. In contrast, exceptionally preserved fossils reveal that derived avian features were present in the digestive systems of some non-enantiornithine birds with ages exceeding 125 million years [4, 5]. Here, we report a new piscivorous enantiornithine from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota of China. This specimen preserves a gastric pellet that includes fish bones. The new enantiornithine, like many modern piscivores and raptors, seems to have swallowed its prey whole and regurgitated indigestible materials such as bones, invertebrate exoskeletons, scales, and feathers. This fossil represents the oldest unambiguous record of an avian gastric pellet and the only such record from the Mesozoic. The pellet points to a fish diet and suggests that the alimentary tract of the new enantiornithine resembled that of extant avians in having efficient antiperistalsis and a two-chambered stomach with a muscular gizzard capable of compacting indigestible matter into a cohesive pellet. The inferred occurrence of these advanced features in an??enantiornithine implies that they were widespread??in Cretaceous birds and likely facilitated dietary diversification within both Enantiornithes and Ornithuromorpha."
5,"Effects of chronic exposure to cadmium and temperature, alone or combined, on the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus): Interest of digestive enzymes as biomarkers.","The development of predictive, sensitive and reliable biomarkers is of crucial importance for aquatic biomonitoring to assess the effects of chemical substances on aquatic organisms, especially when it comes to combined effects with other stressors (e.g. temperature). The first purpose of the present study was to evaluate the single and combined effects of 90?€?days of exposure to an environmental cadmium concentration (0.5?€???g?€?L<sup>-1</sup>) and two water temperatures (16 and 21?€???C) on different parameters. These parameters are involved in (i) the antioxidant system (superoxide dismutase activity -SOD- and total glutathione levels -GSH-), (ii) the energy metabolism, i.e. energy reserves (glycogen, lipids, proteins) and digestive enzymes (trypsin, amylase, intestinal alkaline phosphatase -IAP-), and (iii) biometric parameters (weight, length, Fulton's condition factor, and the gonadosomatic index -GSI-) of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). The second purpose was to determine the interest of the three digestive enzymes as biomarkers in comparison with the other parameters. The higher temperature (21?€???C) impacted the anti-oxidant and energy reserve parameters. In liver, GSH levels increased on day 60, while SOD decreased on days 15 and 90, with a significant decrease of protein and lipid energy reserves on day 90. In muscle, the higher temperature decreased SOD activity only on day 90. G. aculeatus biometric parameters were also impacted by the higher temperature, which limited stickleback growth after 90?€?days of exposure. In female sticklebacks, the GSI peaked on day 60 and decreased sharply on day 90, while the highest values were reached at day 90 in the control groups, suggesting impaired reproduction in sticklebacks raised at 21?€???C. These results suggest that 21?€???C is an upper-limit temperature for long-term physiological processes in sticklebacks. In contrast, very low-concentration cadmium exposure had no effect on classical biomarkers (energy reserves, antioxidant parameters, biometric parameters). However, digestive enzymes showed an interesting sensitivity to cadmium, which was emphasized by high temperature. The activity of the three digestive enzymes decreased significantly on day 90 when sticklebacks were exposed to cadmium alone, while the decrease was stronger and was recorded earlier (from day 15) when they were exposed to the cadmium-temperature combination. Compared to conventional measurements, digestive enzymes responded rapidly. This could be an important advantage for them to be used as early warning tools to reflect the health status of organisms, particularly for trypsin and IAP activities."
5,Prospecting for cellulolytic activity in insect digestive fluids.,"Efficient cellulolytic enzymes are needed to degrade recalcitrant plant biomass during ethanol purification and make lignocellulosic biofuels a cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels. Despite the large number of insect species that feed on lignocellulosic material, limited availability of quantitative studies comparing cellulase activity among insect taxa constrains identification of candidate species for more targeted identification of effective cellulolytic systems. We describe quantitative determinations of the cellulolytic activity in gut or head-derived fluids from 68 phytophagous or xylophagous insect species belonging to eight different taxonomic orders. Enzymatic activity was determined for two different substrates, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), approximating endo-beta-1,4-glucanase and complete cellulolytic activity, respectively. Highest CMC gut fluid activities were found in Dictyoptera, Coleoptera, Isoptera, and Orthoptera, while highest MCC gut fluid activities were found in Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera. In most cases, gut fluid activities were greater with CMC compared to MCC substrate, except in Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera. In contrast, cellulolytic activity levels in most head fluids were greater on the MCC substrate. Our data suggests that a phylogenetic relationship may exist for the origin of cellulolytic enzymes in insects, and that cellulase activity levels correlate with taxonomic classification, probably reflecting differences in plant host or feeding strategies."
5,Genetic Tools for the Analysis of Drosophila Stomatogastric Nervous System Development.,"The Drosophila stomatogastric nervous system (SNS) is a compact collection of neurons that arises from the migration of neural precursors. Here we describe genetic tools allowing functional analysis of the SNS during the migratory phase of development. We constructed GAL4 lines driven by fragments of the Ret promoter, which yielded expression in a subset of migrating neural SNS precursors and also included a distinct set of midgut associated cells. Screening of additional GAL4 lines driven by fragments of the Gfrl/Munin, forkhead, twist and goosecoid (Gsc) promoters identified a Gsc fragment with expression from initial selection of SNS precursors until the end of embryogenesis. Inhibition of EGFR signaling using three identified lines disrupted the correct patterning of the frontal and recurrent nerves. To manipulate the environment traveled by SNS precursors, a FasII-GAL4 line with strong expression throughout the entire intestinal tract was identified. The transgenic lines described offer the ability to specifically manipulate the migration of SNS precursors and will allow the modeling and in-depth analysis of neuronal migration in ENS disorders such as Hirschsprung's disease.

5,Endovascular embolization for managing anastomotic bleeding after stapled digestive tract anastomosis.,"Anastomotic bleeding is an infrequent but life-threatening complication after stapled digestive tract anastomosis. Endovascular embolization is one of the available treatments, but precise clinical outcomes are yet to be evaluated.To evaluate the efficacy and safety of endovascular embolization for managing anastomotic bleeding after stapled digestive tract anastomosis.Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with anastomotic bleeding after stapled digestive tract anastomosis by digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Curative effect was summed for analysis.All bleeding arteries were located in the stoma and were identified by contrast agent spillover by DSA. The offending arteries were superselectively catheterized and embolized with microcoils and/or gelatin sponge particles. Laboratory examinations showed normal hemoglobin and red blood cell counts when the patients' abdominal cavity drainage tubes stopped draining blood. The follow-up period was 3.2-84.7 months (median, 19.7 months). Four patients died during this time, of which two had cholangiocarcinoma, one had gastric cancer with tumor recurrence and multiple organ failure, and the final patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage 4 months after embolization. In the surviving patients, no rebleeding occurred after embolization and no additional intervention or surgery was required.Endovascular embolization is safe and effective for managing anastomotic bleeding after stapled digestive tract anastomosis."
5,[Aero-digestive tract squamous intra-epithelial neoplasia].,"Aero-digestive tract squamous intra-epithelial neoplasia is a disease whose genetic and epigenetic features lead to clinical signs and well codified histologic features. This publication aims to review the molecular alterations which have been identified in these lesions, to clarify the clinical manifestations and to discuss the proposed histological classification."
5,"Relationship between valve activity, microalgae concentration in the water and toxin accumulation in the digestive gland of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas exposed to Alexandrium minutum.","The complexity of the relationships between Alexandrium minutum (A.m.) concentration in the water ([A.m.](w)), Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning contamination in the digestive gland ([PSP](dg)) and valve behavior was explored in oysters Crassostrea gigas. Two experiments were conducted, during which oysters' valve behaviour were analyzed. Oysters, first acclimated for 10-days with the non harmful microalgae Heterocapsa triquetra (H.t.), were exposed to four microalgae mixtures at constant total concentrations of 10??10(3)cells ml(-1) (experiment-1) and 5??10(3)cells ml(-1) (experiment-2): 100% A.m.; 50% A.m.-50% H.t.; 25% A.m.-75% H.t.; 100% H.t. At the end of experiment-2, [PSP](dg) were measured. At 10??10(3)cells ml(-1), the microalgal ingestion decreased (p<0.05) with increasing [A.m.](w) but not at 5??10(3)cells ml(-1) (p>0.05). The frequency of microclosures specifically increased with [A.m.](w) (p<0.05) and the opening duration with [PSP](dg) (p<0.0001). Oysters exhibiting the maximum increase in opening duration also exhibited the highest [PSP](dg). The results are discussed in terms of oyster physiology and origin of the behavioral response."
5,Association between promoters polymorphisms of matrix metalloproteinases and risk of digestive cancers: a meta-analysis.,"A variety of studies have been performed to elucidate the polymorphisms in promoter regions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) associated with the risk of digestive cancers, and yet, results remain conflicting and heterogeneous. Thus, we undertook a systematic meta-analysis to determine the genetic susceptibility of MMPs to digestive cancers.A computerized literature search was conducted in databases of PubMed, Embase, and ISI Web of Knowledge till October 2012 for any MMP genetic association study in oral squamous, gastric, esophageal, and colorectal carcinomas. Odds ratios (OR) and 95??% confidence interval (CI) were estimated for each gene under dominant and recessive models, and the heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Q test and I (2) value. Overall and subgroup analysis according to anatomical sites and ethnicity was carried out. Statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.0.A total of 40 eligible publications with 68 comparisons were included in this study. For MMP1 nt-1607, individuals with 2G state could increase risk of digestive cancers in total analysis (dominant: OR??=??1.31, 95??% CI??=??1.16-1.48, P??<??0.00001; recessive: OR??=??1.29, 95??% CI??=??1.11-1.50, P??=??0.0009). In the subgroup of tumor sites, significant associations were also observed in esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer under both genetic models. For MMP2 nt-1306, CT or TT carriers performed significant protection against digestive cancer in the dominant model (OR??=??0.69, 95??% CI??=??0.55-0.85, P??=??0.0007) of the overall. In the subgroup analysis, significant association was found in esophageal cancer, with borderline effects in gastric cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma. For MMP7 -181 A/G, significant association was observed under two genetic models in the overall (dominant: OR??=??1.26, 95??% CI??=??1.10-1.43, P??=??0.0009; recessive: OR??=??1.33, 95??% CI??=??1.11-1.60, P??=??0.002) and in the individual cancer subgroup of esophageal cancer and gastric cancer. For MMP9 -1,562 C/T, a borderline effect was found with digestive cancers in the total and stratified analysis of the colorectal cancer under dominant model. No association was observed in either the overall or subgroup analysis for MMP3 -1,171 5A/6A.Our meta-analysis demonstrated the fact that polymorphisms in promoter regions of MMP genes might be related to the susceptibility of digestive cancers, with cancer development for MMP1 and MMP7, and a protection against cancer for MMP2 and MMP9. Further evidences with adequate sample sizes need to be conducted."
5,Time-course study of the early lysosomal responses to pollutants in mussel digestive cells using acid phosphatase as lysosomal marker enzyme.,"Lysosomal biomarkers are early warning signals of the biological effects caused by environmental pollutants but the promptness of lysosomal responses to pollutants has not been investigated yet. This work is aimed to determine the response-time of digestive cell lysosomes in mussels exposed to metals and hydrocarbons. Mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were exposed, under laboratory conditions to Cd and to the water-accommodated fraction of a lubricant oil. One mussel per experimental group was sacrificed and processed every hour from 0 h to 30 h. Changes in AcP activity, immunoreactivity and LMS test based on AcP histochemistry, discriminates significantly control and exposed mussels within 5 h exposure. The present results suggested that after 15-20 h exposure digestive cell loss might be accompanied by increased AcP activity (extralysosomal) without a parallel increase in the levels of immunoreactive AcP protein, especially after Cd-exposure. The reduced labilisation period of lysosomal membrane constitute a cost effective early warning signal that, however, is not necessarily correlated with the exposure time. The routine application of immunochemical techniques deserves more research efforts before its implementation although, these techniques are very valuable to understand and interpret correctly lysosomal responses to pollutants."
5,[Two types of digestive tract reconstruction after proximal gastrectomy for early gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma: a randomized controlled study].,"To investigate the better method of digestive tract reconstruction in proximal gastrectomy for early gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.A total of 153 cases of early gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who were planned to receive radical proximal gastrectomy from January 2003 to December 2011 were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided into two groups by table of random number according to methods of digestive tract reconstruction, including 3S anastomosis group (80 cases, 3S jejunal interposition) and traditional anastomosis group (73 cases, esophageal remnant gastric posterior wall anastomosis). Postoperative complications, operative time, mortality, nutritional parameters and postoperative quality of life were compared between these two groups.There were no significant differences between two groups in postoperative complications, operative time and mortality (all P>0.05). 3S anastomosis group was better in nutritional parameters than traditional group six months after operation (P<0.05). As compared to traditional group, incidence of reflux esophagitis decreased [20.0%(16/80) vs. 46.6%(34/73), P<0.01] and gastric emptying time prolonged obviously [(160.8??8.1) min vs. (61.1??10.8) min, P<0.01] in 3S anastomosis group 18 months after operation. Postoperative QLQ-C30 rating scale revealed quality of life was significantly higher in 3S anastomosis group as compared to traditional group.Jejunal interposition is a better method of digestive tract reconstruction in proximal gastrectomy for early gastroesophageal junction carcinoma."
5,Opium use and risk of mortality from digestive diseases: a prospective cohort study.,"Opium use, particularly in low doses, is a common practice among adults in northeastern Iran. We aimed to investigate the association between opium use and subsequent mortality from disorders of the digestive tract.We used data from the Golestan Cohort Study, a prospective cohort study in northeastern Iran, with detailed, validated data on opium use and several other exposures. A total of 50,045 adults were enrolled during a 4-year period (2004-2008) and followed annually until December 2012, with a follow-up success rate of 99%. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to evaluate the association between opium use and outcomes of interest.In all, 8,487 (17%) participants reported opium use, with a mean duration of 12.7 years. During the follow-up period 474 deaths from digestive diseases were reported (387 due to gastrointestinal cancers and 87 due to nonmalignant etiologies). Opium use was associated with an increased risk of death from any digestive disease (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.24-1.93). The association was dose dependent, with a HR of 2.21 (1.57-3.31) for the highest quintile of cumulative opium use vs. no use (Ptrend=0.037). The HRs (95% CI) for the associations between opium use and malignant and nonmalignant causes of digestive mortality were 1.38 (1.07-1.76) and 2.60 (1.57-4.31), respectively. Increased risks were seen both for smoking opium and for ingestion of opium.Long-term opium use, even in low doses, is associated with increased risk of death from both malignant and nonmalignant digestive diseases."
5,Are digestive symptoms in women presenting with pelvic endometriosis specific to lesion localizations? A preliminary prospective study.,"What are the types and frequency of digestive symptoms in patients with different localizations of pelvic endometriosis and which specific symptoms are related to rectal stenosis?There is a high prevalence of digestive complaints in women presenting with superficial pelvic endometriosis and deep endometriosis sparing the rectum.Women presenting with pelvic endometriosis frequently report gastrointestinal complaints of increased intensity during menstruation, which are not necessarily linked to the infiltration of the disease into the rectal wall. Even though intrarectal protrusion of the nodule can have an impact on bowel movement, only a minority of women with rectal nodules seemed to be concerned by significant narrowing of the rectum.This three-arm cohort prospective study included 116 women and was carried out over 22 consecutive months.Prospective recording of data was performed for women treated for Stage 1 endometriosis involving the Douglas pouch (n = 21), deep endometriosis without digestive infiltration (n = 42) and deep endometriosis infiltrating the rectum (n = 53). Patient characteristics, pelvic pain and data from preoperative standardized questionnaires The Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), the Knowles-Eccersley-Scott-Symptom Questionnaire (KESS) and the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were compared according to endometriosis localization.The values of total KESS and total GIQLI score were comparable for the three groups, as were a majority of the digestive complaints. Women presenting with rectal endometriosis were more likely to report an increase in intensity and length of dysmenorrhoea, while deep dyspareunia appeared to be more severe in women with superficial endometriosis. Women presenting with rectal endometriosis were more likely to present cyclic defecation pain (67.9%), cyclic constipation (54.7%) and a significantly longer stool evacuation time, although these complaints were also frequent in the other two groups (38.1 and 33.3% in women with Stage 1 endometriosis and 42.9 and 26.2% in women with deep endometriosis without digestive involvement, respectively). No independent clinical factor was found to be related to infiltration of the rectum by deep endometriosis. Among women with rectal endometriosis, only 26.4% presented with rectal stenosis. These women were significantly more likely to report constipation, defecation pain, appetite disorders, longer evacuation time and increased stool consistency without laxatives.Patients treated for pelvic endometriosis in a tertiary referral centre may not be representative of the general endometriosis population presenting with those lesions. Statistically significant differences were revealed between the three groups; however, the results were based on a small number of subjects, which carries an inherent risk of type II error particularly when comparing variables with closed values.In women presenting with pelvic endometriosis, it seems likely that various digestive symptoms are the consequence of cyclic inflammatory phenomena leading to irritation of the digestive tract, rather than to actual infiltration of the disease itself into the rectum, with the exception of a limited number of cases where the disease leads to rectal stenosis.The North-West Inter Regional Female Cohort for Patients with Endometriosis (CIRENDO) is financed by the G4 Group (The University Hospitals of Rouen, Lille, Amiens and Caen). No financial support was specifically received for this study. The authors declare no conflict of interest."
5,Digestive development in neonatal dairy calves with either whole or ground oats in the calf starter.,"A series of 3 trials was conducted to determine effects of whole or ground oats in starter grain on reticulorumen fermentation and digestive system development of preweaned calves. Male Holstein calves (43.1??2.3kg at birth; n=8, 9, and 7 for trials 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were housed in individual pens in a heated facility; bedding was covered with landscape fabric to prevent consumption of bedding by the calves. In trials 1 and 2 only, calves were fitted with rumen cannulas by wk 2 of life. In all trials, a fixed amount of starter (containing 25% oats either ground and in the pellet or whole) was offered daily; orts were fed through the cannula in trials 1 and 2. Calves were randomly assigned to an all-pelleted starter or pellets plus whole oats. Rumen contents (trials 1 and 2) were sampled weekly at -8, -4, 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after grain feeding for determination of pH and volatile fatty acids. Calves were killed 3 wk (trial 1) or 4 wk (trials 2 and 3) after grain was offered; organs were harvested, emptied, rinsed, and weighed to gauge digestive organ development. Starter intake was not different between treatments. Weekly measurements of rumen digesta pH did not change and only subtle changes were observed in molar proportions of individual volatile fatty acids. Molar proportion of butyrate and pH linearly decreased with age, whereas acetate proportion increased. Reticulorumen weight and papillae length tended to be greater for calves fed pelleted starter, whereas abomasum weight was greater for calves fed pellets plus whole oats. Fecal particle size and starch content were greater for calves fed pellets plus whole oats. Under the conditions of this study, physical form of oats in starter grain did not affect rumen fermentation measurements; greater rumen weight and papillae length in calves fed pelleted starter may be the result of greater nutrient availability of ground oats. Under the conditions of this study with young calves on treatments for <4 wk, increasing particle size of the starter by feeding whole oats did not affect rumen fermentation nor did it improve digestive system development.

5,Current clinical status of <sup>18</sup>F-FLT PET or PET/CT in digestive and abdominal organ oncology.,"Positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/computed tomography (CT) using <sup>18</sup>F-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine (<sup>18</sup>F-FLT) offers noninvasive assessment of cell proliferation in human cancers in vivo. The present review discusses the current status on clinical applications of <sup>18</sup>F-FLT-PET (or PET/CT) in digestive and abdominal oncology by comparing with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG)-PET (or PET/CT). The results of this review show that although <sup>18</sup>F-FLT uptake is lower in most cases of digestive and abdominal malignancies compared with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake, <sup>18</sup>F-FLT-PET can be used to detect primary tumors. <sup>18</sup>F-FLT-PET has shown greater specificity for N staging than <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET which can show false-positive uptake in areas of inflammation. However, because of the high background uptake in the liver and bone marrow, it has a limited role of assessing liver and bone metastases. Instead, <sup>18</sup>F-FLT-PET will be a powerful tool for monitoring response to treatment and provide prognostic information in digestive and abdominal oncology."
5,Surface characteristics of isopod digestive gland epithelium studied by SEM.,"The structure of the digestive gland epithelium of a terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber has been investigated by conventional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM), and light microscopy in order to provide evidence on morphology of the gland epithelial surface in animals from a stock culture. We investigated the shape of cells, extrusion of lipid droplets, shape and distribution of microvilli, and the presence of bacteria on the cell surface. A total of 22 animals were investigated and we found some variability in the appearance of the gland epithelial surface. Seventeen of the animals had dome-shaped digestive gland ""normal"" epithelial cells, which were densely and homogeneously covered by microvilli and varying proportions of which extruded lipid droplets. On the surface of microvilli we routinely observed sparsely distributed bacteria of different shapes. Five of the 22 animals had ""abnormal"" epithelial cells with a significantly altered shape. In three of these animals, the cells were much smaller, partly or completely flat or sometimes pyramid-like. A thick layer of bacteria was detected on the microvillous border, and in places, the shape and size of microvilli were altered. In two animals, hypertrophic cells containing large vacuoles were observed indicating a characteristic intracellular infection. The potential of SEM in morphological investigations of epithelial surfaces is discussed."
5,Enterocyte Purge and Rapid Recovery Is a Resilience Reaction of the Gut Epithelium to Pore-Forming Toxin Attack.,"Besides digesting nutrients, the gut protects the host against invasion by pathogens. Enterocytes may be subjected to damage by both microbial and host defensive responses, causing their death.??Here, we report a rapid epithelial response that alleviates infection stress and protects the enterocytes from the action of microbial virulence factors. Intestinal epithelia exposed to hemolysin, a pore-forming toxin secreted by Serratia marcescens, undergo an evolutionarily conserved process??of thinning followed by the recovery of their initial thickness within a few hours. In response to??hemolysin attack, Drosophila melanogaster enterocytes extrude most of their apical cytoplasm, including damaged organelles such as mitochondria, yet do not lyse. We identify two secreted peptides, the expression of which requires CyclinJ, that mediate the recovery phase in which enterocytes regain their original shape and volume. Epithelial thinning and recovery constitute a fast and efficient response to intestinal infections, with pore-forming toxins acting as alarm signals."
5,Porcine models of digestive disease: the future of large animal translational research.,"There is increasing interest in nonrodent translational models for the study of human disease. The pig, in particular, serves as a useful animal model for the study of pathophysiological conditions relevant to the human intestine. This review assesses currently used porcine models of gastrointestinal physiology and disease and provides a rationale for the use of these models for future translational studies. The pig has proven its utility for the study of fundamental disease conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, stress-induced intestinal dysfunction, and short bowel syndrome. Pigs have also shown great promise for the study of intestinal barrier function, surgical tissue manipulation and intervention, as well as biomaterial implantation and tissue transplantation. Advantages of pig models highlighted by these studies include the physiological similarity to human intestine and mechanisms of human disease. Emerging future directions for porcine models of human disease include the fields of transgenics and stem cell biology, with exciting implications for regenerative medicine."
5,"The effect of starvation on the ultrastructure of the digestive cells of Dolops ranarum (Stuhlmann, 1891) (Crustacea: Branchiura).","Transmission electron microscopy was conducted on the digestive epithelium of the crustacean ectoparasite Dolops ranarum to elucidate its ultrastructure for the first time, both in a nourished and starved condition. Specimens were collected from the Limpopo Drainage System in South Africa, and the specimens were killed and dissected in Todd's fixative. The anterior midgut is composed mostly of absorptive cells or R cells, while the diverticula are composed of R cells and of F cells, which are moderately abundant in rough endoplasmic reticulum. They are probably responsible for producing digestive enzymes. The posterior midgut is composed of papilliform B cells with large apically located vesicles and R' cells devoid of cell inclusions. Under starvation, specimens survive for a maximum of 12 days; R cells show the most conspicuous changes in ultrastructural characteristics. It is concluded that D. ranarum has adapted to short-term survival only without a host."
5,"Post-embryonic changes in the hindgut of honeybee Apis mellifera workers: Morphology, cuticle deposition, apoptosis, and cell proliferation.","In insects, the hindgut is a homeostatic region of the digestive tract, divided into pylorus, ileum, and rectum, that reabsorbs water, ions, and small molecules produced during hemolymph filtration. The hindgut anatomy in bee larvae is different from that of adult workers. This study reports the morphological changes and cellular events that occur in the hindgut during the metamorphosis of the honeybee Apis mellifera. We describe the occurrence of autophagosomes and the ultrastructure of the epithelial cells and cuticle, suggesting that cuticular degradation begins in prepupae, with the cuticle being reabsorbed and recycled by autophagosomes in white- and pink-eyed pupae, followed by the deposition of new cuticle in light-brown-eyed pupae. In L5S larvae and prepupae, the hindgut undergoes cell proliferation in the anterior and posterior ends. In the pupae, the pylorus, ileum, and rectum regions are differentiated, and cell proliferation ceases in dark-brown-eyed pupae. Apoptosis occurs in the hindgut from the L5S larval to the pink-eyed pupal stage. In light-brown- and dark-brown-eyed pupae, the ileum epithelium changes from pseudostratified to simple only after the production of the basal lamina, whereas the rectal epithelium is always flattened. In black-eyed pupae, ileum epithelial cells have large vacuoles and subcuticular spaces, while in adult forager workers these cells have long invaginations in the cell apex and many mitochondria, indicating a role in the transport of compounds. Our findings show that hindgut morphogenesis is a dynamic process, with tissue remodeling and cellular events taking place for the formation of different regions of the organ, the reconstruction of a new cuticle, and the remodeling of visceral muscles."
5,[Neuroendocrine tumors of the digestive system].,"Despite their rare occurrence, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have been in the centre of interest because of the wide scale and variability of clinical signs and symptoms associated with oversecretion of different hormones. In the present review the authors summarize epidemiological data, pathologic findings, clinical symptoms, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic methods presently available for the management of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. In addition to surgical treatment and receptor-specific radionuclide therapy used in cases with surgically noncurable tumors, the therapeutic use of somatostatin analogues in recent years has resulted an important advance in the management of patients with these tumors. Somatostatin analogues alone or in combination with other pharmacological therapies may be used effectively for elimination of symptoms of hormonal oversection and, in a number of cases, for diminishing tumor progression."
5,[Digestive disease with anemia].,"Anemia is often observed in digestive diseases such as gastroduodenal ulcers, esophageal varices, atrophic gastritis, malignant neoplasms, inflammatory bowel diseases, gastrectomy, malabsorption syndrome, and liver diseases. Anemia in these digestive diseases is caused by bleeding, iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency including pernicious anemia, chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disorders), malnutrition, hypersplenism. Especially in case of gastrointestinal bleeding, double balloon enteroscopy has been recently introduced to contribute to the diagnosis and treatment as well as gastroendoscopy and colonoscopy. In the treatment of digestive disease with anemia, it is important to treat digestive diseases appropriately. In treatment of patients with anemia of unknown origin, examinations about digestive diseases should be considered."
5,Clinicopathological Significance of RhoA Expression in Digestive Tract Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"RhoA protein expression has been reported in different types of cancer. We performed an up-to-date meta-analysis to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics of RhoA protein expression in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.We searched in several databases, including MEDLINE (PubMed) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, to identify studies examining the association between RhoA protein and cancer. The quality of the included studies was assessed. Cochrane Collaboration's Software Review Manager 5.3 was utilized to test the heterogeneity, overall effect, and publication bias of the combined studies. The reported odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by using fixed and random effects models depending on the heterogeneity of the included studies.A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria of the meta-analysis. RhoA expression was significantly higher in gastrointestinal cancer than in normal tissues. RhoA protein expression in digestive system neoplasms was significantly associated with tumor clinical staging, metastatic status and differentiated degree. However, no association with gender was found. RhoA mRNA expression was no associated with clinicopathological significance.Current evidence supports the conclusion that RhoA expression is associated with clinical staging, metastatic status, and differentiated degree in digestive system neoplasms. RhoA expression may play an important role in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of gastrointestinal cancer."
5,Association of APE1 Gene Asp148Glu Variant with Digestive Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-1 (APE1) is a rate-limiting enzyme in DNA base excision repair and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. In this study, we summarize available data to examine the susceptibility of APE1 gene Asp148Glu variant to digestive cancer via a meta-analysis.Study selection and data abstraction were conducted independently by 2 authors. Random-effects model was utilized to pool effect estimates. Heterogeneity and publication bias were addressed.Sixteen articles involving 4916 digestive cancer patients and 7748 controls were qualified for this meta-analysis. Overall association showed an indicative association between Asp148Glu variant and digestive cancer under allelic (odds ratio or OR=1.11; 95% confidence interval or CI: 0.99-1.25; P=0.074) and dominant (OR=1.18; 95% CI: 1.00-1.40; P=0.056) models, with strong evidence of heterogeneity. Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was an obvious source of heterogeneity. In subgroup analyses by cancer sites, this variant was significantly associated with the increased risk for hepatocellular cancer under allelic (OR=1.50; 95% CI: 1.25-1.80; P<0.001) and homozygous genotypic (OR=1.55; 95% CI: 1.02-2.29; P=0.028) models. There were low probabilities of publication bias for the above comparisons.The results of this meta-analysis collectively suggest that APE1 gene Asp148Glu variant is not a risk-conferring factor for digestive cancer. Further large and well-designed studies are required."
5,Cancer-testis antigen expression in digestive tract carcinomas: frequent expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its precursor lesions.,"Cancer-testis (CT) antigens are attractive tumor antigens for cancer immunotherapy. They comprise a group of proteins normally expressed in germ cells and aberrantly activated in a variety of human cancers. The protein expression of eight cancer-testis antigens [MAGEA, NY-ESO-1, GAGE, MAGEC1 (CT7), MAGEC2 (CT10), CT45, SAGE1, and NXF2] was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 61 esophageal carcinomas (40 adenocarcinoma and 21 squamous cell carcinoma), 50 gastric carcinomas (34 diffuse and 16 intestinal type), and 141 colorectal carcinomas. The highest frequency of expression was found in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas: Positive staining for MAGEA, CT45, CT7, SAGE1, GAGE, NXF2, NY-ESO-1, and CT10 was observed in 57%, 38%, 33%, 33%, 29%, 29%, 19%, and 14% of squamous cell carcinomas, respectively. Similar staining patterns were observed in squamous dysplasias. Expression frequencies of cancer-testis antigens were seen in 2% to 24% of gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas and were not significantly different between adenocarcinomas of the stomach versus the esophagus, or between diffuse and intestinal types of gastric adenocarcinomas. Colorectal cancers did not express NY-ESO-1, CT7, CT10, or GAGE, and only infrequently expressed SAGE1 (0.7%) MAGEA (1.4%), CT45 (3.5%), and NXF2 (8.5%). We conclude that cancer-testis antigens are frequently expressed in esophageal squamous neoplasms. Although cancer-testis antigens are generally considered to be expressed later in tumor progression, they are found in squamous dysplasias, suggesting a potential diagnostic role for cancer-testis antigens in the evaluation of premalignant squamous lesions."
5,Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD): is the game worth the candle?,"Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) is an infection prevention strategy in intensive care unit (ICU) patients by topical administration of antibiotics to the mouth and stomach to eradicate potentially pathogenic bacteria and yeast that may cause infections. It also includes a short course of intravenous antibiotics to treat incubating infections at the time of ICU admission. Several randomized, controlled studies, all performed in ICUs with low rates of antibiotic resistance, have shown that SDD prevents ventilator-associated pneumonia and improves survival. Surprisingly, SDD was also associated with lower rates of colonization with resistant gram-negative bacteria and no effect on methicillin-resistant STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Selective oral decontamination (SOD) consisting of oral antibiotics only, without systemic antibiotics or antibiotics given in the stomach, may also increase survival. In areas with low prevalence of MRSA and VRE, SDD should be considered the standard of care in ICUs. In countries where colonization with MRSA and VRE is frequent, resistance may increase, and SDD should be considered experimental therapy. Future research should focus on the effects of SDD compared with SOD on resistance and on SDD-like strategies in areas where MRSA and VRE are endemic."
5,"The ultrastructure of the digestive cells of Argulus japonicus, Thiele 1900 (Crustacea: Branchiura).","The ultrastructure of the cells of the digestive system of Argulus japonicus is described with the use of transmission electron microscopy. Specimens of Argulus japonicus were collected from the Vaal Dam in South Africa and fixed in Todd's fixative. The samples were post fixed in osmium tetroxide and embedded in resin. The anterior midgut is composed mostly of R cells while the enteral diverticula are composed mainly of R cells in the proximal diverticules and of F cells in the distal diverticula. The posterior midgut is composed of very large papilliform B cells and of R cells. The R cells in the anterior midgut probably absorb nutrients including lipids. The F cells are filled mostly with rough endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting enzyme synthesis, while the B cells portrayed endocytotic vesicles, indicating intracellular digestion of predigested food. The R cells of the posterior midgut are less active than cells present in the anterior midgut. E cells and peritrophic membrane were not observed."
5,Vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia revealed through predominant digestive vagal manifestations. Case report and literature review.,"Vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia is a rare pathology whose atypical forms, dominated by syncopal manifestations, are still rarer. Although the territory of the vagus nerve involves, beyond the cardiovascular system, the respiratory and the digestive systems, there is no report in literature of atypical forms other than syncopal. Therefore, the authors were prompted to report the case of a patient whose vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia was predominantly revealed by digestive symptoms. A 58-year-old patient presented with stereotypical severe digestive disturbances including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. High definition cranial MRI showed a neurovascular conflict between the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and the IXth and Xth nerves, on the right side. A microsurgical decompression was carried out which confirmed the vascular compression and successful transposition of the artery. One year after the surgery, the patient was free from all painful and digestive symptoms. A survey of the literature did not find any reference to digestive symptoms together with the neuralgia; only a syncopal type of cardiac symptoms related to the parasympathetic nervous system were described. The hypothesis was that the revealing digestive symptoms are linked to a similar parasympathetic mechanism, implying the visceral component of the Xth cranial nerve. "
5,Short-term effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of EDC mixtures on Mytilus galloprovincialis digestive gland.,"Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including both natural estrogens and estrogenic chemicals, are almost ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. In the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis different estrogenic compounds, both individually and in mixtures, were shown to affect the immune function both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, individual estrogens, the natural estrogen 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) and the xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA), have been recently demonstrated to alter functional parameters and gene expression in mussel digestive gland, a tissue that plays a central role in metabolism and in nutrient distribution to the gonad during gamete maturation, with possible consequences on gametogenesis. In this work, the possible effects of a synthetic mixture of EDCs on the digestive gland were evaluated. The mixture contained seven estrogenic chemicals (17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-ethynyl estradiol, mestranol (MES), nonylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate carboxylate (NP1EC), BPA, benzophenone (BP)), in proportions similar to those previously found in water samples of a coastal lagoon. Mussels were injected with different concentrations of the mixture (approximate nominal concentrations of total EDCs: 0.0177, 0.177, 1.77 and 177 ng/g dw) and tissues sampled 24 h post-injection. The mixture induced significant changes in lysosomal biomarkers (lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), neutral lipid (NL) and lipofuscin (LF) accumulation) as well as in the activities of catalase, glutathione transferase (GST), and of the glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK). Moreover, downregulation of the gene transcription for the Mytilus estrogen receptor MeER1 isoform and for catalase, as evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR, were observed. Significant changes in lysosomal biomarkers, enzyme activities and gene transcription were also recorded at 72 h post-injection. The results demonstrate that short-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of EDC mixtures can interfere with the lysosomal function, redox-related enzyme activities and gene transcription of mussel digestive gland."
5,Mechanisms of pH control in the midgut of Lutzomyia longipalpis: roles for ingested molecules and hormones.,"Control of the midgut pH in Lutzomyia longipalpis enables the insect's digestive system to deal with different types of diet. Phlebotomines must be able to suddenly change from a condition adequate to process a sugar diet to one required to digest blood. Prior to blood ingestion, the pH in the midgut is maintained at ???6 via an efficient mechanism. In the abdominal midgut, alkalization to a pH of ???8 occurs as a consequence of the loss of CO(2) from blood (CO(2) volatilization) and by a second mechanism that is not yet characterized. The present study aimed to characterize the primary stimuli, present in the blood, that are responsible for shutting down the mechanism that maintains a pH of 6 and switching on that responsible for alkalization. Our results show that any ingested protein could induce alkalization. Free amino acids, at the concentrations found in blood, were ineffective at inducing alkalization, although higher concentrations of amino acids were able to induce alkalization. Aqueous extracts of midgut tissue containing putative hormones from intestinal endocrine cells slightly alkalized the midgut lumen when applied to dissected intestines, as did hemolymph collected from blood-fed females. Serotonin, a hormone that is possibly released in the hemolymph after hematophagy commences, was ineffective at promoting alkalization. The carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme seems to be involved in alkalizing the midgut, as co-ingestion of acetazolamide (a CA inhibitor) with proteins impaired alkalization efficiency. A general model of alkalization control is presented."
5,Effects of body-size and season on digestive organ size and the energy balance of cockles fed with a constant diet of phytoplankton.,"Seasonal variation in size-dependence of seawater clearance rate, absorption efficiency, oxygen consumption, gill area, length of the crystalline style and dry weight of digestive gland was analyzed in cockles Cerastoderma edule from the Mundaka Estuary, Spain. Experimental determinations were performed monthly (from July 1998 to November 1999) in cockles being fed with Tetraselmis suecica (organic content: 87.84 +/- 1.95%) at a concentration of 3 mm(3)/l for 3 days. Analysis of covariance reveals no seasonal differences in both size-dependence of seawater clearance rate and oxygen consumption, which were found to scale to dry body weight with mass-exponents of 0.56 and 0.62, respectively. No significant correlation was found between absorption efficiency and body weight. Mass-exponents for gill area, dry weight of the digestive gland and length of the crystalline style remained constant among seasons showing values of 0.62, 0.34 and 0.82, respectively. Seasonal trends for every physiological determination were calculated for a standard size (200 mg) cockle: standardized clearance rates and oxygen consumptions followed a similar trend with minimum values in winter ( approximately 0.5 l/h and approximately 100 microl O2/h, respectively) and maximum values during spring-summer ( approximately 1.7 l/h and approximately 250 microl O2/h, respectively), whereas absorption efficiency and food throughput time showed both the opposite pattern with highest values corresponding to winter months ( approximately 50-60% and approximately 5-6 h, respectively), and lowest ( approximately 30% and approximately 3-4 h, respectively) to summer-autumn. Scope for growth exhibited minimum values in winter followed by a rapid increase along the winter-spring transition, maximum values being attained in spring (May) and summer (July). Exponential decline of seasonal values of absorption efficiency associated to rising ingestion rates of organic matter presented an asymptotic minimum at 0.35. Absorption efficiency was positively related to food throughput time, whereas the latter fell to a minimum of 3.548 h with increasing food intake. So, maintenance of throughput time-and consequently absorption efficiency-along with enhanced filtering activity provided cockles with higher absorption rates improving scopes for growth registers during spring and summer. These dynamics might be explained as the consequence of the seasonal digestive adjustments in cockles, which, in fact, were found to increase the size of the digestive organs during that period."
5,[Digestive diseases in the epistolary collection of 16th century].,"Correspondence is an important source of documentation for studying health and, therefore, the gastrointestinal symptoms of diseases. We studied the gastrointestinal disease described in the Monumenta Borgia collection, which contains documents from the 16th century, mainly letters about Francis Borgia, the last great figure of a family originally from Valencia and with universal significance. Of the 2769 documents examined, 1231 (44.5%) contained some health-related descriptions and 42 items were related to gastrointestinal disease, representing 7.5% of the specific diseases of natural causes. The most frequently mentioned organ in the whole human body was the stomach, with 20 references. The most frequent references were to symptoms related to the upper gastrointestinal tract, with 18 references, and the lower gastrointestinal tract, with 16. The comments made on health related to gastrointestinal disease usually reflect the typical galenism of the medicine of the times. The disorders attributed to the stomach are described in varied terminology and include an acute episode of gastrointestinal bleeding. The most frequently mentioned symptoms and processes are diarrhea, flatulence, hernias, and, among those attributed to the lower gastrointestinal tract, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhages. Also mentioned are hemorrhoids and intestinal colic. Although little mention is made of the liver and spleen, there are various allusions that Francis Borgia was affected by disease or pathogenic alterations in this area. However, the postmortem examination of his corpse, refuted the existence of these anomalies. "
5,"Microcystin-LR and embryo-larval development of medaka fish, Oryzias latipes. I. Effects on the digestive tract and associated systems.","The cyanobacterial hepatotoxin microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is a specific potent PP1 and PP2A protein phosphatase inhibitor. In view to obtain an integrated whole-body, understanding of the key target organs of MC-LR subsequent to embryonic exposure on the anatomy of medaka fish hatchlings, embryos at stage 19 were microinjected with a sublethal dose of MC-LR corresponding to 0.2 pg/vitellus. MC-LR-induced histo-pathological modifications of the alimentary system (i.e. digestive tract, pancreas, liver) were analysed in newly hatched embryos. Our data are indicative of an MC-LR-induced inhibition of both yolk sac resorption and gas concentrating swimbladder expansion. In contrast to control hatchlings, (i) no mucus-secreting cells in the oesophagus, (ii) a decreased folding of the stomach and intestine, (iii) a clear reduction in size of the exocrine pancreas associated with a destructuration of acinar units, and (iv) a strong decrease in the mass and size of the liver were observed in MC-LR treated embryos. Furthermore, as an indication of MC-LR-induced hepatic glycogen store depletion, unstained cytoplasmic areas present in control hatchling hepatocytes, were fully absent in all liver examined in treated embryos. Finally, as a general observation in MC-LR-treated embryos, our data clearly indicated terminal differentiation disorders in all organs associated with the digestive tract."
5,[Symptoms and pathomechanism of changes in the digestive system during the course of systemic lupus erythematosus].,"In this work, authors make an attempt to review and systematize digestive system symptoms and pathomechanism of changes in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). They also point out the increasing role of visual methods in the diagnostics of connective tissue diseases. It should be noted that though Osler described first visceral symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus in 1895, this topic has gained little interest in literature."
5,"The Expensive-Tissue Hypothesis in Vertebrates: Gut Microbiota Effect, a Review.","The gut microbiota is integral to an organism&rsquo;s digestive structure and has been shown to play an important role in producing substrates for gluconeogenesis and energy production, vasodilator, and gut motility. Numerous studies have demonstrated that variation in diet types is associated with the abundance and diversity of the gut microbiota, a relationship that plays a significant role in nutrient absorption and affects gut size. The Expensive-Tissue Hypothesis states (ETH) that the metabolic requirement of relatively large brains is offset by a corresponding reduction of the other tissues, such as gut size. However, how the trade-off between gut size and brain size in vertebrates is associated with the gut microbiota through metabolic requirements still remains unexplored. Here, we review research relating to and discuss the potential influence of gut microbiota on the ETH."
5,"[Bariatric surgery, stomas and other digestive tract reductions: Insufficient data and recommendations to adapt medicines regimens in therapeutic practice].","Surgery modifying digestive tract may alter drugs pharmacokinetics. To maintain concentrations of active substance in their therapeutic ranges, a dosage adjustment or change of drug may be necessary. This is particularly important when no pharmacological or pharmacodynamic parameter reflecting the medication effectiveness is easily measurable. Our objective was to gather the information and documentary tools that can guide prescription in these patients with rearranged digestive tract. We searched information on the documentary portals of French agencies, on gray literature, on MEDLINE and in the summaries product characteristics. No information was found on the website of French agencies, sparse data were identified in gray literature. Some document are discordant, most are imprecise. One hundred and ten studies or case reports referenced on MEDLINE describe 79 medications pharmacokinetics after gastrointestinal surgery. Four are not available in France. Six literature reviews were found. Four summaries of product characteristics provided information related to drug absorption. No documentary tool adapted to clinical routine exists. This unsatisfactory situation is a barrier to optimal patients care. Information is available. It is however necessary to gather under an ergonomic shape adapted to clinical routine, bringing the surgery type, pharmacokinetic changes induced and what to do about the dose adjustment. "

5,[Heterochronies in the Formation of the Nervous and Digestive Systems in Early Postlarval Development of Opistobranch Mollusks: Organization of Basic Functional Systems of the Arctic Dorid Cadlina laevis].,"For the first time using laser confocal microscopy and histochemical and immunocytochemical methods (detection of F-actine, catecholamines, acetylcholintransferase, substances of P and FM RFamide) in combination with classical histological methods and electron microscopy of total preparations, the general structure and regularities of formation of the main organs and the nervous, muscular, and digestive systems in early postlarval development (2 to 4 months) in the opistobranch mollusk Cadlina laevis were studied. Heterochronies manifested in positive allometry of the sensory organs, ganglia of the central nervous system, and the pharyngeal region of the digestive system in relation to general body sizes in juvenile individuals compared to adult animals were detected."
5,Controls on gut phosphatisation: the trilobites from the Weeks Formation Lagerst??tte (Cambrian; Utah).,"Despite being internal organs, digestive structures are frequently preserved in Cambrian Lagerst??tten. However, the reasons for their fossilisation and their biological implications remain to be thoroughly explored. This is particularly true with arthropods--typically the most diverse fossilised organisms in Cambrian ecosystems--where digestive structures represent an as-yet underexploited alternative to appendage morphology for inferences on their biology. Here we describe the phosphatised digestive structures of three trilobite species from the Cambrian Weeks Formation Lagerst??tte (Utah). Their exquisite, three-dimensional preservation reveals unique details on trilobite internal anatomy, such as the position of the mouth and the absence of a differentiated crop. In addition, the presence of paired pygidial organs of an unknown function is reported for the first time. This exceptional material enables exploration of the relationships between gut phosphatisation and the biology of organisms. Indeed, soft-tissue preservation is unusual in these fossils as it is restricted to the digestive structures, which indicates that the gut played a central role in its own phosphatisation. We hypothesize that the gut provided a microenvironment where special conditions could develop and harboured a source of phosphorus. The fact that gut phosphatization has almost exclusively been observed in arthropods could be explained by their uncommon ability to store ions (including phosphorous) in their digestive tissues. However, in some specimens from the Weeks Formation, the phosphatisation extends to the entire digestive system, suggesting that trilobites might have had some biological particularities not observed in modern arthropods. We speculate that one of them might have been an increased capacity for ion storage in the gut tissues, related to the moulting of their heavily-mineralised carapace."
5,Development of an in vitro digestive model for studying the peptide profile of breast milk.,"Human milk is a highly valuable food for newborns and infants. Its protein fraction plays an important role for the development of the newborn. In the present study, an in vitro digestive model, developed for resembling closely the digestive system of an infant, was applied to human milk in order to identify and characterize the peptide profile. The peptide profile obtained after digestion was analyzed by ??LC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS. A total of 149 peptides from ??-casein, 30 peptides from ??-lactalbumin, 26 peptides from ??s1-casein, 24 peptides from ??-casein, 28 peptides from osteopontin, and 29 from lactoferrin was recovered. The identified peptide profile of partially hydrolyzed proteins, such as caseins, ??-lactalbumin, and osteopontin, was different from that previously reported demonstrating a different performance of the developed neonatal digestive system with respect to other previously applied. These results would be useful as a starting point to investigate the physiological function of breast milk peptides. "
5,Breast- v. formula-feeding: impacts on the digestive tract and immediate and long-term health effects.,"The health benefits of breast-feeding have been recognised for a long time. In particular, breast-feeding is associated with lower incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and diarrhoea during the early period of life and with lower incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases, type 2 diabetes and obesity later in life. The higher nutritional and protective degree of human milk is related to its nutritional composition that changes over the lactation period and to the biological activities of specific components while lower growth rate of breast-fed infants may be attributed to their self-regulation of milk intake at a lower level than formula-fed infants. Many results now suggest that the developmental changes in intestinal and pancreatic function that occur postnatally are modulated by the diet. Indeed, formula-feeding induces intestinal hypertrophy and accelerates maturation of hydrolysis capacities; it increases intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation, but does not induce evident differences in microbiota composition. Whether these changes would be beneficial for enhancing absorptive capacities and for educating the gut-associated immune system remains to be further studied. Moreover, it is evident that formula-feeding increases basal blood glucose and decreases plasma ketone body concentrations, while discrepancies on postprandial glycaemia, insulin and incretin responses in both human studies and experimental studies are inconclusive. Manipulating the composition of formula, by reducing protein content, adding prebiotics, growth factors or secretory IgA can modulate intestinal and pancreatic function development, and thereby may reduce the differential responses between breast-fed and formula-fed neonates. However, the developmental responses of the digestive tract to different feeding strategies must be elucidated in terms of sensitivity to developing diseases, taking into account the major role of the intestinal microbiota."
5,Selective decontamination of the digestive tract as infection prevention in the critically ill. A level 1 evidence-based strategy.,"Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) evolved into evidence-based medicine as a tool to prevent infections in critically ill patients. It significantly reduces mortality, pneumonia, bloodstream infections and the onset of resistance if the full four-component regimen is used. The use of only oral decontamination may reduce the incidence of pneumonia, but it has no significant impact on mortality. Moreover, the full SDD protocol significantly reduces the fecal carriage of multiresistant aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, whereas oral decontamination only is associated with increased carriage of multiresistant aerobic Gram-negative bacilli."
5,"[Digestive tract perforations at Point G Teaching Hospital in Bamako, Mali].","To determine the most frequent causes of the digestive perforations and to evaluate the surgical procedures, the morbidity and mortality.It was about a retrospective descriptive study, over 5 year's period in a visceral service of CHU du Point G, Bamako. Were included in the study all the patients operated for digestive perforation and hospitalized in the service of surgery ""A"". Were not included in the study patient operated not presenting a digestive perforation. Per operational etiologies of the perforations and their frequency were determined, as well as the morbidity and morbidity and mortality.Files of 202 patients were collected. The average age of the patients was 28.3 ?? 15.5 years with extremes of 6 and 71 years. The frequency of digestive perforations was higher in the age from 11 to 20 years (29.7%). The average time of consultation was of 7?? 6 days. Abdominal pains, nauseas and vomiting, matter and gas stop (48.5%) were the most current functional signs. A ""wood belly"" abdomen was found in 72,3% of the cases. The radiography of abdomen without preparation found a diffuse greyness (64.7%), a pneumoperitoine (30.7%). A double antibiotic therapy was made in all the cases. A median laparotomy was practiced in 98,5%, and laparoscopy in 3 cases (1.5%). A single perforation was found among 172 patients (85,1%). Morbidity, all confused causes, was made of 30 cases of parietal suppurations (14.8%). Total mortality was 74%. According to aetiologies it was 10.3% in the typhic perforations, 4.6% in the appendicular perforations and 4.9% in the perforations of gastroduodenal ulcers.The most frequent aetiologies of digestive perforation in our context were the typhoid fever, acute appendicitis and the gastroduodenal ulcer. The r??section - joining and peritoneal toilet were the most practised procedure. The main factor of bad outcome remains the diagnostic delay burdening morbidity and mortality."
5,Digestive fistulas after cytoreductive surgery & HIPEC in peritoneal carcinomatosis.,"The development of digestice fistulas is a complication of gastrointestinal operations during cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). In this article we present the incidence, management and outcome of enterocutaneous digestive fistulas after CRS and HIPEC.Over the past 10 years (2005-2014), 184 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis underwent CRS and HIPEC. HIPEC was administered in the operating room immediately after CRS, but in 48 (26%) patients this happened before the formation of intestinal anastomosis or repair of seromuscular tears, using the open (coliseum) technique; in the remaining 137 (74%) patients the anastomoses were performed before HIPEC. All patients were operated on by the same surgical team.Of the 185 patients 16 (8.6%) developed an enterocutaneous digestive fistula. Spontaneous fistula closure was observed in 14 (87.5%) patients. The median duration of spontaneous closure was 18 days (range 9-56). Reoperation was needed in 2 (12.5%) patients. There were 2 (12.5%) deaths.CRS and HIPEC is a well-known treatment modality for peritoneal carcinomatosis. The incidence of digestive fistulas is increased a little compared to that of conventional digestive surgery."
5,Formation of the digestive system in zebrafish. II. Pancreas morphogenesis.,"Recent studies have suggested that the zebrafish pancreas develops from a single pancreatic anlage, located on the dorsal aspect of the developing gut. However, using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses GFP throughout the endoderm, we report that, in fact, two pancreatic anlagen join to form the pancreas. One anlage is located on the dorsal aspect of the developing gut and is present by 24 h postfertilization (hpf), the second anlage is located on the ventral aspect of the developing gut in a position anterior to the dorsal anlage and is present by 40 hpf. These two buds merge by 52 hpf to form the pancreas. Using heart and soul mutant embryos, in which the pancreatic anlagen most often do not fuse, we show that the posterior bud generates only endocrine tissue, while the anterior bud gives rise to the pancreatic duct and exocrine cells. Interestingly, at later stages, the anterior bud also gives rise to a small number of endocrine cells usually present near the pancreatic duct. Altogether, these studies show that in zebrafish, as in the other model systems analyzed to date, the pancreas arises from multiple buds. To analyze whether other features of pancreas development are conserved and investigate the influence of surrounding tissues on pancreas development, we examined the role of the vasculature in this process. Contrary to reports in other model systems, we find that, although vascular endothelium is in contact with the posterior bud throughout pancreas development, its absence in cloche mutant embryos does not appear to affect the early morphogenesis or differentiation of the pancreas."
5,Pleiotropic effects of hexavalent chromium (CrVI) in Mytilus galloprovincialis digestive gland.,"Hexavalent Chromium Cr(VI) is an important contaminant considered as a model oxidative toxicant released from both domestic and industrial effluents, and represents the predominant chemical form of the metal in aquatic ecosystems. On the other hand, in mammals the reduced form Cr(III) is considered an essential microelement, involved in regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism; moreover, recent evidence suggests that Cr may have endocrine effects. In this work, the effects of Cr(VI) were investigated in the digestive gland of the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis. Mussels were exposed to 0.1-1-10-100 ??g Cr(VI) L(-1) animal(-1) for 96 h. At 100 ??g L(-1), a large increase in total Cr tissue content was observed; in these conditions, the lysosomal membranes were completely destabilized, whereas other lysosomal biomarkers (neutral lipids-NL and lipofuscin-LF), as well as different enzyme activities and gene expression were unaffected, this indicating severe stress conditions in the tissue. On the other hand, at lower concentrations, changes in other histochemical, biochemical and molecular endpoints were observed. In particular, at both 1 and 10 ??g L(-1), lysosomal destabilization was associated with significant NL and LF accumulation; however, no changes in catalase and GSH transferase (GST) activities were observed. At the same concentrations, GSSG reductase (GSR) activity was significantly increased, this probably reflecting the recycling of GSSG produced in the GSH-mediated intracellular reduction of Cr(VI). Increased activities of the key glycolytic enzymes PFK (phosphofructokinase) and PK (pyruvate kinase) were also observed, indicating that Cr(VI) could affect carbohydrate metabolism. Cr(VI) induced downregulation or no effects on the expression of metallothioneins MT10 and MT20, except for an increase in MT20 transcription in males. Moreover, significant up-regulation of the Mytilus estrogen receptor MeER2 and serotonin receptor (5-HTR) were observed in both sexes. The results demonstrate that exposure to Cr(VI) in the low ppb range did not result in strong toxicity or oxidative stress conditions in mussel digestive gland. On the other hand, our data support the hypothesis that low concentrations of the metal can exert pleiotropic effects on mussel physiology, from modulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, to effects on the expression of estrogen-responsive genes."
5,"Sub-cellular partitioning of Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb in the digestive gland of native Octopus vulgaris exposed to different metal concentrations (Portugal).","Concentrations of Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb and their sub-cellular distributions were determined in composite samples of digestive glands of the common octopus, Octopus vulgaris caught from two areas of the Portuguese coast characterised by contrasting metal contamination. Minor contents of Zn (1%), Cu (2%), Cd (6%) and Pb (7%) were found in the insoluble fraction, consisting of nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes and microsome operationally separated from the whole digestive gland through a sequential centrifugation. A tendency for linear relationships between metal concentrations in nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes and whole digestive gland was observed. These relationships suggest that despite low metal content organelles responded to the increasing accumulated metals, which means that detoxifying mechanism in cytosol was incomplete. Poorer correlations between microsome and whole digestive gland did not point to metal toxicity in the analysed compartments. However, the high accumulated Cd indicated that O. vulgaris is an important vehicle of this element to its predators in the coastal environment."
5,Differential cellular expression of galectin family mRNAs in the epithelial cells of the mouse digestive tract.,"Galectin is an animal lectin that recognizes beta-galactosides of glycoconjugates and is abundant in the gut. This study revealed the cellular expression of galectin subtypes throughout the mouse digestive tract by in situ hybridization. Signals for five subtypes (galectin-2, -3, -4/6, and -7) were detected exclusively in the epithelia. In the glandular stomach, galectin-2 and -4/6 were predominantly expressed from gastric pits to neck of gastric glands, where mucous cells were the main cellular sources. The small intestine exhibited intense, maturation-associated expressions of galectin-2, -3, and -4/6 mRNAs. Galectin-2 was intensely expressed from crypts to the base of villi, whereas transcripts of galectin-3 gathered at villous tips. Signals for galectin-4/6 were most intense at the lower half of villi. Galectin-2 was also expressed in goblet cells of the small intestine but not in those of the large intestine. In the large intestine, galectin-4/6 predominated, and the upper half of crypts simultaneously contained transcripts of galectin-3. Stratified epithelium from the lip to forestomach and anus intensely expressed galectin-7 with weak expressions of galectin-3. Because galectins in the digestive tract may be multi-functional, information on their cell/stage-specific expression contributes to a better understanding of the functions and pathological involvements of galectins."
5,Paradoxical ventilator associated pneumonia incidences among selective digestive decontamination studies versus other studies of mechanically ventilated patients: benchmarking the evidence base.,"Selective digestive decontamination (SDD) appears to have a more compelling evidence base than non-antimicrobial methods for the prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). However, the striking variability in ventilator associated pneumonia-incidence proportion (VAP-IP) among the SDD studies remains unexplained and a postulated contextual effect remains untested for.Nine reviews were used to source 45 observational (benchmark) groups and 137 component (control and intervention) groups of studies of SDD and studies of three non-antimicrobial methods of VAP prevention. The logit VAP-IP data were summarized by meta-analysis using random effects methods and the associated heterogeneity (tau2) was measured. As group level predictors of logit VAP-IP, the mode of VAP diagnosis, proportion of trauma admissions, the proportion receiving prolonged ventilation and the intervention method under study were examined in meta-regression models containing the benchmark groups together with either the control (models 1 to 3) or intervention (models 4 to 6) groups of the prevention studies.The VAP-IP benchmark derived here is 22.1% (95% confidence interval; 95% CI; 19.2 to 25.5; tau2 0.34) whereas the mean VAP-IP of control groups from studies of SDD and of non-antimicrobial methods, is 35.7 (29.7 to 41.8; tau2 0.63) versus 20.4 (17.2 to 24.0; tau2 0.41), respectively (P < 0.001). The disparity between the benchmark groups and the control groups of the SDD studies, which was most apparent for the highest quality studies, could not be explained in the meta-regression models after adjusting for various group level factors. The mean VAP-IP (95% CI) of intervention groups is 16.0 (12.6 to 20.3; tau2 0.59) and 17.1 (14.2 to 20.3; tau2 0.35) for SDD studies versus studies of non-antimicrobial methods, respectively.The VAP-IP among the intervention groups within the SDD evidence base is less variable and more similar to the benchmark than among the control groups. These paradoxical observations cannot readily be explained. The interpretation of the SDD evidence base cannot proceed without further consideration of this contextual effect."
5,"Cellular distribution of okadaic acid in the digestive gland of Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819).","The distribution of okadaic acid between the digestive and the secretory cells of the digestive gland of Mytilus galloprovincialis was studied for the main purpose of determining if they might be responsible for the two-compartment depuration kinetics found in previous studies. The two cell types did not accumulate okadaic acid to the same degree. However, the concentrations found in each cellular type were not consistent with those expected from the output of the two-compartment depuration model, suggesting that a mechanism other that the differential accumulation in cellular types is involved. Binding to some yet undetermined cellular components is suggested."
5,Perioperative music therapy with a key-lighting keyboard system in elderly patients undergoing digestive tract surgery.,"It is important to minimize the perioperative mental dysfunction of elderly patients undergoing surgery and to avoid lowering their coping skills postoperatively. Music therapy for digestive tract surgery has yet not been explored.We evaluated perioperative music therapy using a simple key-lighting keyboard system in 37 elderly patients who underwent digestive tract surgery (Group A) compared with 13 patients who were not applied music therapy (Group B).On the first day after surgery there were no general hemodynamic changes after music therapy. There were no significant changes in the Philadelphia Geriatric Center morale scale and the Yesavage depression scale between the day before surgery and 7 POD in both groups. The self-assessed visual analogue health scale and the number connection test worsened significantly from 58.9+/-14.6 and 159+/-47 to 42.3+/-14.6 and 199+/-51 (p<0.05), respectively, over this time in Group B, but it did not worsen significantly in Group A. The happiness score increased significantly from 3.9+/-1.1 to 4.6+/-1.2 (P<0.05) over this time in Group A, but it did not increase significantly in Group B.We conclude that the music therapy with a key-lighting keyboard system in elderly patients does not change postoperative hemodynamics and helps to maintain perioperative mental functioning."
5,Purification and properties of digestive lipases from Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and New Zealand hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae).,"Lipases were purified from delipidated pyloric ceca powder of two New Zealand-sourced fish, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae), by fractional precipitation with polyethylene glycol 1000, followed by affinity chromatography using cholate-Affi-Gel 102, and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 HR. For the first time, in-polyacrylamide gel activity of purified fish lipases against 4-methylumbelliferyl butyrate has been demonstrated. Calcium ions and sodium cholate were absolutely necessary both for lipase stability in the gel and for optimum activity against caprate and palmitate esters of p-nitrophenol. A single protein band was present in native polyacrylamide gels for both salmon and hoki final enzyme preparations. Under denaturing conditions, electrophoretic analysis revealed two bands of 79.6 and 54.9 kDa for salmon lipase. It is proposed that these bands correspond to an uncleaved and a final form of the enzyme. One band of 44.6 kDa was seen for hoki lipase. pI values of 5.8??0.1 and 5.7??0.1 were obtained for the two salmon lipase forms. The hoki lipase had a pI of 5.8??0.1. Both lipases had the highest activity at 35??C, were thermally labile, had a pH optimum of 8-8.5, and were more acid stable compared to other fish lipases studied to date. Both enzymes were inhibited by the organophosphate paraoxon. Chinook salmon and hoki lipases showed good stability in several water-immiscible solvents. The enzymes had very similar amino acid composition to mammalian carboxyl ester lipases and one other fish digestive lipase. The salmon enzyme was an overall better catalyst based on its higher turnover number (3.7??0.3 vs. 0.71??0.05 s(-1) for the hoki enzyme) and lower activation energy (2.0??0.4 vs. 7.6??0.8 kcal/mol for the hoki enzyme) for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl caprate. The salmon and hoki enzymes are homologous with mammalian carboxyl ester lipases."
5,The mucosa of the digestive tract in Micropogonias furnieri: a light and electron microscope approach.,"The histomorphological aspects as well as the histochemical content and distribution of glycoproteins (GPs) in the mucosa of the digestive tract of the white croaker Micropogonias furnieri were studied. The buccopharyngeal cavity and the esophagous showed a squamous stratified epithelium with mucous cells. The stomach presented three portions: cardias, fundus and pylorus. Tubular glands formed by a single type of gland cell were located along the cardias and fundus. Histochemical tests showed that the buccopharyngeal cavity and the esophagous presented the largest amount of the different types of mucosubstances. Both organs showed abundant secretory mucous cells that synthesize large quantities of neutral, sulphated and sialylated GPs. The surface epithelium in the cardias and fundus synthesized and secreted scarce sialylated and neutral GPs whereas the secretions of the apical surface were abundant. The pylorus secreted large amounts of neutral as well as sulphated and sialylated GPs. Gland cells secreted neutral GPs. The ultrastructural features of the gut cells were quite similar to those of other teleosts. The buccopharyngeal cavity and the esophagous surface epithelial cells, identified by their superficial localization, were characterized by cytoplasmic vesicles of different size. Abundant goblet cells with secretory mucous granules were also present. Gastric glands in the stomach contained just one form of cell with a fine structure similar to cells that secrete pepsinogen."
5,Stress-induced changes in accumulation of sorbitol and in activities of concomitant enzymes in digestive gland of freshwater snail.,"Sorbitol content was determined in the digestive gland of freshwater snail (Viviparus viviparus L.) in different seasons and in a short-term experiment on the water temperature decrease and on intoxication with cadmium chloride. In the model experiments, changes in activities of enzymes involved in sorbitol metabolism (acid phosphatases, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and aldose reductase) were also studied. Sorbitol was accumulated by the snail in response to the temperature decrease (as a cryoprotectant) and under conditions of acute intoxication (as a probable metabolic regulator or a nonspecific protective factor). However, the mechanisms of this accumulation are different: on cold adaptation sorbitol is produced as a result of reduction of glucose under the influence of aldose reductase, and on intoxication sorbitol is mainly produced from fructose under the influence of sorbitol dehydrogenase. Pathways of the sorbitol accumulation and its re-involvement into metabolism are not always the same, and this might be a mechanism for regulation of carbohydrate metabolism (at the initial stage of glycolysis) on adaptation to unfavorable factors of the environment."
5,Influence of in ovo injection of glutamine and carbohydrates on digestive organs and pectoralis muscle mass in the duck.,"1. We hypothesise that administration of available glutamine and carbohydrates by in ovo injection may provide energy for small intestine and duck embryo activity, in turn alleviating energy lack, sparing the pectoralis muscle protein and increasing breast muscle mass. To test this hypothesis, 220 duck eggs at 21 d of incubation were chosen and assigned to two treatments. At 23 d of incubation, glutamine, digestible sucrose and maltose were injected into the amniotic fluid in the treatment group. 2. In ovo injection of glutamine and carbohydrates improved small intestine development, as reflected in the increase in weight and sucrase activity, though gizzard, proventriculus and liver weight were not affected by the in ovo injection. 3. Compared with control, pectoralis weight in treatment ducks was increased by 24% at 25 d of incubation and 15% at hatch and this advantage was sustained until 7 d posthatch. In ovo injection improved duck weight gain in the early days posthatch. 4. The results of the present study suggest that in ovo injection of glutamine and carbohydrates improves small intestine development and pectoralis mass, which is probably due to sparing of breast muscle protein."
5,Distinct or shared actions of peptide family isoforms: II. Multiple pyrokinins exert similar effects in the lobster stomatogastric nervous system.,"Many neuropeptides are members of peptide families, with multiple structurally similar isoforms frequently found even within a single species. This raises the question of whether the individual peptides serve common or distinct functions. In the accompanying paper, we found high isoform specificity in the responses of the lobster (Homarus americanus) cardiac neuromuscular system to members of the pyrokinin peptide family: only one of five crustacean isoforms showed any bioactivity in the cardiac system. Because previous studies in other species had found little isoform specificity in pyrokinin actions, we examined the effects of the same five crustacean pyrokinins on the lobster stomatogastric nervous system (STNS). In contrast to our findings in the cardiac system, the effects of the five pyrokinin isoforms on the STNS were indistinguishable: they all activated or enhanced the gastric mill motor pattern, but did not alter the pyloric pattern. These results, in combination with those from the cardiac ganglion, suggest that members of a peptide family in the same species can be both isoform specific and highly promiscuous in their modulatory capacity. The mechanisms that underlie these differences in specificity have not yet been elucidated; one possible explanation, which has yet to be tested, is the presence and differential distribution of multiple receptors for members of this peptide family. "
5,Gut pH as a limiting factor for digestive proteolysis in cultured juveniles of the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata).,"After the development of the gastric function in juvenile fish, dietary proteins enter a two-phase digestive process comprising an acidic gastric phase followed by an alkaline intestinal phase. However, the main gastric protease, pepsin, is strictly dependent on the existence of a low-enough environmental pH. In 20-g gilthead sea bream, Sparus aurata, the mean minimal gastric pH is close to 4.5, while the mean pH in the duodenal portion of the intestine was nearly fixed at 6.5. The mean maximal gastric content of HCl was approximately 20??microEq for a low-buffering diet. Gastric proteases were more severely affected than intestinal proteases when assayed at actual sub-optimal pH values, 4.5 and 6.5, respectively. When the gastric proteases of juvenile fish were pre-incubated with a citric acid buffer at pH 6.0, the activity at pH 4.5 was very low, whereas when they were pre-incubated with the same buffer at pH 3.0, the activity at pH 4.5 was significantly increased; this fact suggests a deficient activation of zymogens during the gastric digestion and points to a potential approach to improve protein digestion in juvenile gilthead sea bream."
5,Digestive enzymatic activity on tropical gar (Atractosteus tropicus) larvae fed different diets.,"Digestive enzymatic activity and growth performance on tropical gar (Atractosteus                         tropicus) larvae fed Artemia nauplii (LF), frozen adult Artemia (AB), an artificial diet (AF) with 46% protein and 16% lipids and a starvation group (SG) from first feeding (5??days after hatching-5 DAH) to 34 DAH were studied. All larvae under starvation (SG) died at 15 DAH. By the end of the experimental period, morphological variables (total length, wet weight and specific growth rate) were significant in larvae fed AF compared to LF and AB. All enzymes studied in the experiment were present since the start of exogenous feeding (including pepsin) and the enzymatic activity varied with the diets. Low levels of enzymatic activity were observed until the 29 DAH; however, after this moment, there was a significant increase (eightfold), particularly for the AF treatment. In vitro protein digestibility tests performed with enzymatic extracts showed that artificial diets with 52% protein and 14% lipids were better digested by larvae before 30 DAH, while diets with 45% protein and 11% lipids were better digested after this age. Taking into account the better growth performance, higher enzymatic activity and better protein digestibility obtained, artificial diets can be used since the start of exogenous feeding on tropical gar larvae, as in other lepisosteids."
5,Comparison of cytochemical procedures to estimate lysosomal biomarkers in mussel digestive cells.,"Enlargement and membrane destabilisation in digestive cell lysosomes of mussels are biomarkers of pollution effect. Cytochemical methods are currently applied to determine lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) and lysosomal structural changes (LSC). LMS, determined after grading N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase activity on cryotome sections of digestive gland, is measured as labilisation period (LP). LSC, determined after image analysis of cryotome sections where beta-glucuronidase activity is revealed, are measured as lysosomal volume (Vv), surface (Sv), numerical (Nv) densities and surface-to-volume ratio (S/V). Both methods have now been compared in a field study. Mussels were collected from Biscay Bay (Plentzia, reference; Muskiz, moderately polluted) and North Aegean Sea (Olympiada, reference; Limani, heavily polluted). Higher Vv and Sv and lower S/V and LP were recorded in polluted sites than in reference sites. Significant correlations with LP were found for Vv and S/V. The cost/effectiveness and environmental significance of both methods are discussed."
5,"[Coupled evolution of digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and excretory systems: a model investigation].","A model is developed of evolution of an organism with digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and excretory systems at the single system. The model is realized on the basis of the language STELLA 8.0. A balance is found between perfection of each individual physiological system and necessary energy expenditures for survival of the organism as a whole. The model is based on a coupled development of several visceral systems. There is analyzed effect of a change of consumption of substances with food and of oxygen amount on their oxidation, a branching of blood flow to organs, specifically to kidneys, to excrete final products of metabolism from blood. The energy expenditures for circulation are believed to be proportional to blood flow in a given organ. An increase of efficiency of renal excretion from blood of final metabolic products and toxic substances has a favorable effect on inner medium and activity of each cell of an individual, but increases of the organism energy expenditures. Interrelation of these factors under conditions of adaptation to changing environmental conditions determines peculiarities of evolution of each physiological system in an individual."
5,Effect of a low-flatulogenic diet in patients with flatulence and functional digestive symptoms.,"Diets rich in fermentable residues increase intestinal gas production. Our aim was to demonstrate the potential effects of diet on gas-related symptoms.The effect of a low-flatulogenic test diet (restricted to foodstuffs low in fermentable residues; n??=??15) was compared to that of a balanced control diet (Mediterranean type; n??=??15) in 30 patients complaining of flatulence and other abdominal symptoms using a randomized parallel design. The following outcomes were measured daily: number of anal gas evacuations by an event marker, severity of gas-related symptoms by 0-10 scales, and sensation of digestive comfort by a -5 (unpleasant) to +5 (pleasant) scale. Measurements were taken pretreatment for 3??days on their habitual diet and for 7??days during the treatment phase.No pretreatment differences were detected between patients allocated to the control or test diets. The test diet significantly reduced the number of gas evacuations (by 54??????10%; p??=??0.002 vs basal diet) whereas the control diet had a lesser effect (reduction by 28??????9%; p??=??0.059 vs basal diet; p??=??0.089 vs test diet). Compared to the control diet, the test diet significantly reduced flatulence (by 48??????7% vs 27??????8%, respectively; p??=??0.018), abdominal distension (by 48??????4% vs 22??????12%, respectively; p??=??0.038), and enhanced digestive well-being (by 149??????18% vs 58??????22%, respectively; p??=??0.006).In patients with gas-related symptoms, a low-flatulogenic diet produces immediate beneficial effects with digestive, cognitive, and emotive dimensions. The number of gas evacuations is an objective biological marker of response to dietary treatment."
5,Metformin and digestive disorders.,"Digestive disorders (diarrhoea, vomiting) represent the most common metformin side-effects (around 30%) with this first-line drug treatment for type 2 diabetes. In healthy individuals, metformin affects glucose, vitamin B12 and the digestive uptake of bile salts. In the colon, it acts locally by modifying glucose cell metabolism. Different pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed to explain the metformin-induced diarrhoea and vomiting, which can sometimes cause the patient to stop an effective treatment. These theories include stimulation of intestinal secretion of serotonin, changes in incretin and glucose metabolism, and bile-salt malabsorption. However, none of these hypotheses can be considered an adequate pathophysiological explanation of metformin digestive side-effects. In addition, there is a lack of experimental data to explain these highly patient-dependent adverse effects."
5,"<i>In vitro</i> Trypanocidal Activity, Genomic Analysis of Isolates, and <i>in vivo</i> Transcription of Type VI Secretion System of <i>Serratia marcescens</i> Belonging to the Microbiota of <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i> Digestive Tract.","<i>Serratia marcescens</i> is a bacterium with the ability to colonize several niches, including some eukaryotic hosts. <i>S. marcescens</i> have been recently found in the gut of hematophagous insects that act as parasite vectors, such as <i>Anopheles, Rhodnius</i>, and <i>Triatoma</i>. While some <i>S. marcescens</i> strains have been reported as symbiotic or pathogenic to other insects, the role of <i>S. marcescens</i> populations from the gut microbiota of <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i>, a vector of Chagas' disease, remains unknown. Bacterial colonies from <i>R. prolixus</i> gut were isolated on BHI agar. After BOX-PCR fingerprinting, the genomic sequences of two isolates RPA1 and RPH1 were compared to others <i>S. marcescens</i> from the NCBI database in other to estimate their evolutionary divergence. The <i>in vitro</i> trypanolytic activity of these two bacterial isolates against <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> (DM28c clone and Y strain) was assessed by microscopy. In addition, the gene expression of type VI secretion system (T6SS) was detected <i>in vivo</i> by RT-PCR. Comparative genomics of RPA1 and RPH1 revealed, besides plasmid presence and genomic islands, genes related to motility, attachment, and quorum sensing in both genomes while genes for urea hydrolysis and type II secretion system (T2SS) were found only in the RPA1 genome. The <i>in vitro</i> trypanolytic activity of both <i>S. marcescens</i> strains was stronger in their stationary phases of growth than in their exponential ones, with 65-70 and 85-90% of epimastigotes (Dm28c clone and Y strain, respectively) being lysed after incubation with RPA1 or RPH1 in stationary phase. Although T6SS transcripts were detected in guts up to 40 days after feeding (DAF), <i>R. prolixus</i> morbidity or mortality did not appear to be affected. In this report, we made available two trypanolytic <i>S. marcescens</i> strains from <i>R. prolixus</i> gut to the scientific community together with their genomic sequences. Here, we describe their genomic features with the purpose of bringing new insights into the <i>S. marcescens</i> adaptations for colonization of the specific niche of triatomine guts. This study provides the basis for a better understanding of the role of <i>S. marcescens</i> in the microbiota of <i>R. prolixus</i> gut as a potential antagonist of <i>T. cruzi</i> in this complex system."
5,Digestive enzymes of human and nonhuman primates.,"All living organisms need to consume nutrients to grow, survive, and reproduce, making the successful acquisition of food resources a powerful selective pressure. However, acquiring food is only part of the challenge. While all animals spend much of their daily activity budget hunting, searching for, or otherwise procuring food, a large part of what is involved in overall nutrition occurs once the meal has been swallowed. Most nutritional components are too complex for immediate use and must be broken down into simpler compounds, which can then be absorbed by the body. This process, digestion, is catalyzed by enzymes that are either endogenous or produced by the host's microbial population.<sup>1</sup> Research shows that the nutritional value of food is partially constrained by the digestive abilities of the microbial community present in the host's gut and that these microbes rapidly adapt to changes in diet and other environmental pressures.<sup>2</sup> An accumulating body of evidence suggests that endogenously produced digestive enzymes also have been, and still are, common targets of natural selection, further cementing their crucial role in an organism's digestive system.<sup>3-5</sup>."
5,Influence of the Biliary System on Biliary Bacteria Revealed by Bacterial Communities of the Human Biliary and Upper Digestive Tracts.,"Biliary bacteria have been implicated in gallstone pathogenesis, though a clear understanding of their composition and source is lacking. Moreover, the effects of the biliary environment, which is known to be generally hostile to most bacteria, on biliary bacteria are unclear. Here, we investigated the bacterial communities of the biliary tract, duodenum, stomach, and oral cavity from six gallstone patients by using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We found that all observed biliary bacteria were detectable in the upper digestive tract. The biliary microbiota had a comparatively higher similarity with the duodenal microbiota, versus those of the other regions, but with a reduced diversity. Although the majority of identified bacteria were greatly diminished in bile samples, three Enterobacteriaceae genera (Escherichia, Klebsiella, and an unclassified genus) and Pyramidobacter were abundant in bile. Predictive functional analysis indicated enhanced abilities of environmental information processing and cell motility of biliary bacteria. Our study provides evidence for the potential source of biliary bacteria, and illustrates the influence of the biliary system on biliary bacterial communities. "
5,"Screening of intestinal probiotics and the effects of feeding probiotics on the growth, immune, digestive enzyme activity and intestinal flora of Litopenaeus vannamei.","In this experiment, 426 strains were isolated from the intestinal tract of Litopenaeus vannamei, and 11 strains showed strong digestive enzyme production activity and antagonistic effect against common bacterial pathogens of shrimp. After hemolysis activity test and drug sensitivity test, 2 candidate probiotics with good bacteriostatic activity, strong enzyme production ability and relatively sensitive to antibiotics were screened out, and were identified by 16s rDNA molecular identification and Biolog-System as Enterobacter hominis (E3) and lactobacillus (L3). First, the biological characteristics of 2 candidate probiotics were studied. The optimum growth conditions of E3: temperature, 30?€???C; pH, 8.0; NaCl, 2.5%; bovine bile salt, 0.15%; and the optimum growth conditions of L3: temperature, 40?€???C; pH, 6.0; NaCl, 0.5%; bovine bile salt, 0.0015%. Secondly, a 28-day feeding experiment was conducted using probiotic concentration of 10<sup>7</sup>?€?CFU?€?g<sup>-1</sup> to determine the changes of the activities of blood related immune enzymes (SOD, PPO, ACP, POD, CAT, LZM) and intestinal digestive enzymes (NP, AL, LPS) during the feeding process of shrimp, the results showed that during the course of feeding, the activities of immune enzyme and digestive enzyme of shrimp fed with probiotics showed an increasing trend, and the growth rate of body weight of shrimp was higher than that of control group. After feeding, the cumulative mortality of probiotics groups were significantly lower than that of the control group after WSSV infection. And the mid-gut of L. vannamei was observed by electron microscope, the results showed that the intestinal mucosa was tight and the epithelium cells showed an active secretory state in probiotics group. Finally, the intestinal microbial communities of shrimp were compared and analyzed by using Biolog-ECO method in the later period of feeding, the results showed: compared with the control group, the average color change rate of the experimental group fed with probiotics increased significantly, indicating that probiotics enhanced the intestinal microorganism activity; The ability of intestinal microorganism to utilize carbon source was significantly enhanced in the experimental group, which indicated that the digestive enzyme secreted by probiotics could improve the digestion and absorption rate of prawn feed, thus promoting the rapid growth of shrimp; The Shannon index, Simpson index and McIntosh index of probiotics groups showed significant difference in 1st and 5th days, but tended to be the same in the 10th day, the results showed that probiotics could maintain in L. vannamei intestines at least 5 days."
5,"Correlation between TGF-??1-509 C>T polymorphism and risk of digestive tract cancer in a meta-analysis for 21,196 participants.","The association between transforming growth factor ??1 (TGF-??1)-509 C>T and risk of digestive tract cancer (DTC) remained uncertain as previous studies reported conflicting results. The aim of this study was to assess the association by using a meta-analysis. The databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE and WANGFANG (Chinese database) were retrieved, and latest update was on 2nd February, 2012. Pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (OR and 95% CI) were calculated by using a fixed- or random-effect model. Ultimately, twenty nine case-control studies with 8664 cases and 12,532 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, there was no association between TGF-??1-509 C>T and risk of DTC in all genetic comparison models (OR and 95% CI: 0.96 and 0.81-1.15 for TT vs. CC, 0.98 and 0.91-1.05 for T carriers vs. C carriers). When subgroup analyses were conducted according to ethnicity, types of cancer and sample size, T allele was significantly associated with decreased risk of DTC for Caucasians and for large sample-sized studies, and was associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer (OR and 95% CI for TT vs. CC: 0.82 and 0.70-0.97 for Caucasians, 0.80 and 0.68-0.98 for large sample-sized studies, 0.78 and 0.62-0.97 for colorectal cancer). This study indicated that TGF-??1-509 C>T polymorphism was probably associated with risk of DTC, especially for Caucasians. Because of modest limitation, our findings should be confirmed by future studies."
5,Transcriptomic Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes During Larval Development of Rapana venosa by Digital Gene Expression Profiling.,"During the life cycle of shellfish, larval development, especially metamorphosis, has a vital influence on the dynamics, distribution, and recruitment of natural populations, as well as seed breeding. Rapana venosa, a carnivorous gastropod, is an important commercial shellfish in China, and is an ecological invader in the United States, Argentina, and France. However, information about the mechanism of its early development is still limited, because research in this area has long suffered from a lack of genomic resources. In this study, 15 digital gene expression (DGE) libraries from five developmental stages of R. venosa were constructed and sequenced on the IIIumina Hi-Sequation 2500 platform. Bioinformaticsanalysis identified numerous differentially and specifically expressed genes, which revealed that genes associated with growth, nervous system, digestive system, immune system, and apoptosis participate in important developmental processes. The functional analysis of differentially expressed genes was further implemented by gene ontology, and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment. DGE profiling provided a general picture of the transcriptomic activities during the early development of R. venosa, which may provide interesting hints for further study. Our data represent the first comparative transcriptomic information available for the early development of R. venosa, which is a prerequisite for a better understanding of the physiological traits controlling development."
5,New issues about melatonin and its effects on the digestive system.,"In human beings, melatonin is secreted in a cyclic way by the pineal gland, although it has been detected in other tissues. Synthesis of melatonin takes place in the pinealocyte. It depends on adrenergic stimulation, and its secretion is related to the photoperiod in a circadian model of low activity during light phase and high activity at night time. Former studies aimed to establish the mechanisms by which melatonin carries out its biological function, proved the existance of high affinity binding sites. However, melatonin can pass through the plasmatic membrane; this property suggested a possible activity of the hormone inside the cell trough activation of nuclear receptors. Moreover, melatonin can act by itself as a potent oxygen-free-radical scavenger, which renders it a very strong antioxidant. It is currently accepted that melatonin plays an important role in numerous physiological processes. The gastrointestinal tract of numerous animal species contains melatonin, which is synthesized essentially by intestinal enterochrommaffin cells. Some investigations have revealed that its liberation follows also a circadian rhythm, although its secretion pattern might be influenced by nutritional factors. Receptors for melatonin have been identified in the digestive system, therefore the indolamine might play a leading role in different aspects of the vast digestive physiopathology. The hormone may interact with receptors and subsequently stimulate the synthesis of gastroprotective hormones and also exerts a direct defense on the epithelium, enhances submucosal blood flow and prevents the damage induced by ischemia followed by reperfusion. Moreover, studies have shown that treatment with melatonin reduces the severity of the lesions induced by NSAIDs on gastric mucosa suggesting a beneficial role of melatonin in preventing this gastropathy related to antiinflammatories."
5,[Treatment of neuroendocrine tumors of the digestive tract].,"Neuroendocrine tumors of the digestive tract are relatively rare and comprise benign and malignant tumors. WHO classification system is based on recognized differences in morphology, function and clinical behavior. European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society(ENETS)proposed grading system and TNM classification system with disease staging for endocrine tumors of each organ which are both valid tools for prognostic stratification. The only curative therapy is the complete resection of the tumor. Endoscopic submucosal dissection(ESD)or local resection can be performed in low grade and early stage tumors; on the other hand, curative resection with lymph node dissection is recommended for neuroendocrine carcinoma. Complete surgical resection of liver metastases is associated with better long-term survival. Combination chemotherapy, such as Etoposide+Cisplatin/Carboplatin, is useful in treating unresected neuroendocrine carcinomas. Octreotide and Pasireotide (SOM230), somatostatin analogues, are reported to have the benefit of both hormonal symptom control and tumor growth suppression. Development of new effective drug is expected for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors of the digestive tract."
5,Effect of Oral ??3-Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids as a Complement Management to Control Fistula Output and Inflammation in Patients With Digestive Fistula.,"The presence of digestive fistula involves chronic inflammation and fibrosis. It has been reported that ??3-polyunsaturated fatty acids stimulate the resolution of inflammation.Determine if the administration of oral ??3 reduces fistula output and the time required for fistula closure.Forty-nine patients with postoperative fistula were randomly divided in two groups: 26 received conventional treatment and 23 received the conventional treatment supplemented with ??3 (540??mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 360??mg docosahexaenoic acid) for 35??days. Patients were monitored daily for fistula output and spontaneous closure. Additionally, serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein were quantified in four patients with conventional and in seven patients with ??3 treatment.Patients with ??3 had significantly decreased fistula output from days 2 to 27, compared to control (p?€?<?€?0.05). Spontaneous fistula closure was achieved in 15 patients (65%) in the ??3 group and in 14 (54%) in the control group. ??3-polyunsaturated fatty intake also decreased the serum concentrations of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein (p?€?<?€?0.05).Our results suggest that ??3 supplementation to conventional medical treatment decreases fistula output and reduces inflammation (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein), and these effects may increase the efficiency of conventional medical treatment."
5,Application of elemental microanalysis to elucidate the role of spherites in the digestive gland of the helicid snail Chilostoma lefeburiana.,"In this case study we present an application of different analytical electron microscopic methods in biology, to elucidate their usefulness in such investigations. Using analytical electron microscopy, spherites in the digestive gland cells of the helicid snail Chilostoma lefeburiana were examined at three stages: just before the non-feeding period of over-wintering in November, in the middle of over-wintering in February and at its end in March. A detailed characterization of changes in the elemental composition of the spherites was characterized by a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy filtering TEM (EFTEM). During over-wintering, the spherites passed the following changes. Before over-wintering in November, they consisted of striking concentric layers of electron-dense and electron-lucent zones, while in February and March they showed clear empty zones between materials of different electron density. In November spherites, C, O, Ca, P, Cl, Fe, Si, Na, K, Mg and S were detected, whereas in February ones C, O, N, Cl, Si and S were found and only C, O, N, Si and Cl were detected in March spherites. It is suggested that the elements missing in February and March were used in different physiological processes during over-wintering, like (1) the maintenance of the appropriate elemental composition of the internal environment, (2) accumulation of non-toxic waste materials that cannot be metabolized and (3) avoiding potential intoxication by contamination with toxic metals."
5,Chitin distribution in the <i>Oithona</i> digestive and reproductive systems revealed by fluorescence microscopy.,"Among copepods, which are the most abundant animals on Earth, the genus <i>Oithona</i> is described as one of the most numerous and plays a major role in the marine food chain and biogeochemical cycles, particularly through the excretion of chitin-coated fecal pellets. Despite the morphology of several <i>Oithona</i> species is well known, knowledge of its internal anatomy and chitin distribution is still limited. To answer this problem, <i>Oithona nana</i> and <i>O. similis</i> individuals were stained by Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Fluorescein IsoThioCyanate (WGA-FITC) and DiAmidino-2-PhenylIndole (DAPI) for fluorescence microscopy observations. The image analyses allowed a new description of the organization and chitin content of the digestive and reproductive systems of <i>Oithona</i> male and female. Chitin microfibrils were found all along the digestive system from the stomach to the hindgut with a higher concentration at the peritrophic membrane of the anterior midgut. Several midgut shrinkages were observed and proposed to be involved in faecal pellet shaping and motion. Amorphous chitin structures were also found to be a major component of the ducts and seminal vesicles and receptacles. The rapid staining protocol we proposed allowed a new insight into the <i>Oithona</i> internal anatomy and highlighted the role of chitin in the digestion and reproduction. This method could be applied to a wide range of copepods in order to perform comparative anatomy analyses."
5,MiR-34b/c rs4938723 Polymorphism Significantly Decreases the Risk of Digestive Tract Cancer: Meta-analysis.,"Previous studies investigating the association between miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism and cancer risk showed inconclusive. Here, we performed meta-analysis to investigate the association between miR- 34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism and digestive cancer risk.Literature database including PubMed, OVID, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched for publications concerning the association between the miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism and digestive cancer risk.A total of 6 studies consisting of 3246 cases and 3568 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The combined analysis suggested the miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism significantly reduced digestive cancer risk under allelic model, homogeneous co-dominant model and recessive model (C vs T: OR=0.88, 95%CI=0.82-0.95, p-value=0.001; CC vs TT: OR =0.67, 95%CI=0.57-0.80, p-value=0.000; CC vsOR=0.68, 95%CI=0.58-0.80, p-value=0.000). Q-test and I2 test revealed no significant heterogeneity in all genotype comparisons. The Begger's funnel plot and Egger's test did not show significant publication bias.The current evidence supports the conclusion that the miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism decreases an individual's susceptibility to digestive cancers."
5,[Management of treatment in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasmas of digestive tract].,"Neuroendocrine neoplasmas are a form of cancer arising from cells of diffuse neuroendocrine system. They produce peptides or amines that act as hormones or neurotransmitters. Incidence of NENs is relatively low. Diagnostic work-up and treatment requires a multidisciplinary team approach. The aim of this study was an analysis of data from patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasmas of gastrointestinal tract. The study included patients followed up from 1998 to 2013 with histologically confirmed well-differentiated digestive neuroendocrine neoplasm with low or intermediate malignant potential. 97 patients were included; 34 men (35.1%) and 63 women (64.9%). In patients being diagnosed after 2005 interferon treatment is significantly less used than endoscopic and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. We have identified more appropriate discriminant values of 5-HIAA and chromogranin A (6.8 mg/24 hours; 70 ng/ml) for predicting the presence of metastases at the time of diagnosis. We have identified following risk factors for overall mortality: liver metastases, presence of diarrhea, flush, small bowel primary tumor, high values of CgA and 5-HIAA at the time of diagnosis (5-HIAA > 520.52 mg/24 hours, CgA > 174.5 ng/ml). Surgical treatment was found to be a positive prognostic factor."
5,Changes in the digestive system in patients suffering from psoriasis.,"Literature published in the recent years provides more evidence for psoriasis being a disease which involves the whole organism. In the course of the disease not only the skin, but also numerous cells and internal organs are affected (1, 2, 3, 6-12, 15, 17, 20). Despite long effort of many research teams, the etiopathogenesis of the disease has remained unknown. Among many suppositions about the cause of psoriasis the one put forward at the Third Psoriatic Congress in Stanford deserves special attention. It suggests that the starting point of the disease are kinetic disturbances of the digestive system (15). This system takes part in decomposition, modifications and synthesis of many organic compounds, including lipids, and disturbances of its function can be reflected in all the metabolic routes. In psoriatic patients structural and functional abnormalities of the digestive system were found in nearly all its segments (1-4, 6-8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20). However, changes revealed in the alimentary tract by means of accessory examinations were hardly ever accompanied by any complications of the system. Long-term observations of a big group of psoriatics carried out in our clinics confirm the absence of subjective symptoms in these patients. The most common anatomopathologic abnormalities in psoriasis are prelipidophilia and palatal lipidophilia, inflammatory changes in the mucous membrane of the stomach and duodenum (gastritis chronica superficialis and duodentis chronica nature), as well as changes in the structure of the hepatic lobule and intestinal villi (1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20)."
5,Epigenetic identification of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 as a functional tumor suppressor and biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma and other digestive tumors.,"The ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is a carboxyl-terminal ubiquitin hydrolase regulating cellular ubiquitin levels, recently suggested as a tumor suppressor. However, the role of UCHL1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not clear. We investigated the expression and DNA methylation of the UCHL1 in primary HCC, liver metastases from digestive carcinomas, and primary digestive cancers. UCHL1 is expressed in all normal tissues and immortalized normal epithelial cell lines, but was low or silenced in 77% (10/13) of HCC cell lines, which is well correlated with its promoter methylation status. Methylation was further detected in 44% (12/27) of HCCs, but less in metastatic tumors generated from colorectal and stomach in the liver (19%, 3/16; P < 0.05). Methylation was also detected in primary digestive tumors, including 71% (22/31) of colon, 77% (53/69) of gastric, and 40% (18/45) of esophageal carcinomas, but none or occasionally in paired adjacent nontumor tissues. Detailed methylation analysis of 49 CpG sites at a 540-bp promoter region by bisulfite genomic sequencing confirmed the methylation. UCHL1 silencing could be reversed by chemical or genetic demethylation of the promoter, indicating direct epigenetic silencing. Restoring UCHL1 expression in silenced cell lines significantly inhibited their growth and colony formation ability by inhibiting cell proliferation, causing cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and inducing apoptosis through the intrinsic caspase-dependent pathway. Moreover, UCHL1 directly interacts with p53 and stabilizes p53 through the ubiquitination pathway.Epigenetic inactivation of UCHL1 is common in primary HCCs and other digestive tumors. UCHL1 appears to be a functional tumor suppressor involved in the tumorigenesis of HCCs and other digestive cancers."
5,[Non-neoplastic sequels of cigarette smoking in the digestive system].,"The paper provides an up-to-date report on the effects of cigarette smoking on the secretory, motor, and transport functions of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. Pathophysiological linkage between the deleterious impact of cigarette smoking on the gastrointestinal tract and several digestive tract diseases is pointed out. Evidence for a decisive role of nicotine in cigarette smoking evoked distortions of gastrointestinal tract functioning is provided."
5,[Expression of carcinoembryonic antigen receptor in digestive organs].,"To explore the significance of the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen receptors (CEAR) in digestive organs.Specimens were procured from 20 male BALB/c mice including esophagus, small intestine, stomach, colon, pancreas, and liver. Kupffer cells were obtained by density gradient centrifugation following enzymatic digestion of the fresh liver specimen. Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry methods were used to detect CEAR in those organs or Kupffer cells.CEAR was found both in cytoplasm and nuclei of the digestive tract mucosal epithelial cells and pancreas islet cells, but only in the cytoplasm of liver cells, Kupffer cells, and smooth muscle cells of the whole digestive tract. The mean ranks of CEAR expression were 174.33 in the mucosal epithelial cells of colon, 160.70 in epithelial cells of small intestine, 139.18 in Kupffer cells, 137.43 in pancreas islet cells, 131.70 in liver cells, 124.23 in gastric epithelial cells, 77.15 in esophageal epithelial cells and 57.80-71.00 in smooth muscle cells of the entire digestive tract examined. There were significantly differences in the CEAR expression intensity among those positive cells (chi2=99.58, P<0.01) while CEAR was not present in submucosal connective tissue cells, pancreatic exocrine cells, or hepatic sinusoid endothelial cells.There are significantly differences in the expression of CEAR in the main digestive organs according to the different tissue and cells, which may play an important role in the carcinogenesis and hepatic metastasis from tumors of the digestive system."
5,Submucosal hematoma: a new distinctive sign during emergency upper digestive endoscopy for ammonia ingestion.,"Submucosal hematoma has never been associated with caustic injuries. Long-term follow-up of patients who ingested ammonia is not well known and ammonia ingestion is rare.In a Single-center observational study, prospective data were collected from 2009 to 2013, in patients over the age of 14??years old referred for ammonia ingestion. The emergency and follow-up endoscopic data and the outcome were reported.Ammonia ingestion occurred in 43 patients. Submucosal hematoma of the gastric wall was a distinctive endoscopic sign observed in 15 (34.8%) cases. Oropharyngeal lesions were present in 30 (69.8%) patients, which was associated with ingestion with suicidal intent in 18 cases. Mild and severe endoscopic lesions (grade IIB to IIIB) were found in 16 (37.2%) cases with 10 (23.3%) cases presenting submucosal hematoma at initial endoscopy. A complete spontaneous gastric healing was frequently observed in 36 (83.7%) cases. In 11 cases with submucosal hematoma, a favourable outcome was observed with a medical treatment, however 6 of these patients had severe endoscopic lesions initially.Submucosal hematoma of the gastric wall is an endoscopic sign occurring frequently in ammonia ingestion. Submucosal hematoma should be distinguished from necrosis in order to avoid false misclassification in favour of more severe lesions, which would lead to an abusive surgery."
5,Cyclooxygenase-2 immunoexpression in intestinal epithelium and lamina propria of cats with inflammatory bowel disease and low grade alimentary lymphoma.,"Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is an inducible isoform by cellular activation, proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors. The aims of the current study were to evaluate COX-2 immunoexpression in epithelial and lamina propria (LP) of cats with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and low grade alimentary lymphoma (LGAL), as well as to correlate them with clinical signs and histopathological scoring. Cats diagnosed with IBD and LGAL (2007-2013) were included in the current study. Feline chronic enteropathy activity index (FCEAI) was calculated for all cases. Control group was composed by 3 healthy indoor cats and 5 sick cats died or were euthanized (non-gastrointestinal illness). Diagnosis and classification of IBD and LGAL was established according to the WSAVA gastrointestinal standardization group template and the National Cancer Institute formulation, respectively. Furthermore, a modified WSAVA template was applied for LGAL evaluation. Immunolabelling for COX-2 (polyclonal rabbit anti-murine antibody) was performed on biopsy samples. Epithelial and LP (inflammatory or neoplastic cells) COX-2 immunolabelling was calculated according to the grade and intensity. The most representative segment scored by the WSAVA and the modified WSAVA were used for statistical analysis.Significant difference was found regarding COX-2 intensity overexpression in the epithelial cells of IBD and LGAL groups when compared to control cats, but not between the groups of sick cats, whereas no differences were found regarding the grade of immunoreactivity between groups. No difference was found for COX-2 immunoexpression at the LP between all groups. However, 3 cats from LGAL group showed COX-2 expression in neoplastic cells at the LP. There were no correlations between epithelial or LP COX-2 expression and FCEAI and histological alterations.Increased COX-2 intensity at the epithelial cells observed in cats with IBD and LGAL may be secondary to the inflammatory response or a protective function in the intestinal reparation. COX-2 expression at the LP was presented in 33% of LGAL. This result provides a reason for further investigation concerning the role of COX-2 expression in feline alimentary lymphoma."
5,Transient magneto-peristaltic flow of couple stress biofluids: a magneto-hydro-dynamical study on digestive transport phenomena.,"Magnetic fields are increasingly being utilized in endoscopy and gastric transport control. In this regard, the present study investigates the influence of a transverse magnetic field in the transient peristaltic rheological transport. An electrically-conducting couple stress non-Newtonian model is employed to accurately simulate physiological fluids in peristaltic flow through a sinusoidally contracting channel of finite length. This model is designed for computing the intra-bolus oesophageal and intestinal pressures during the movement of food bolus in the digestive system under magneto-hydro-dynamic effects. Long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations have been employed to reduce the governing equations from nonlinear to linear form, this being a valid approach for creeping flows which characterizes physiological dynamics. Analytical approximate solutions for axial velocity, transverse velocity, pressure gradient, local wall shear stress and volumetric flow rate are obtained for the non-dimensional conservation equations subject to appropriate boundary conditions. The effects of couple stress parameter and transverse magnetic field on the velocity profile, pressure distribution, local wall shear stress and the averaged flow rate are discussed with the aid of computational results. The comparative study of non-integral and integral number of waves propagating along the finite length channel is also presented. Magnetic field and non-Newtonian properties are found to strongly influence peristaltic transport. "
5,Fingerprinting Acute Digestive Diseases by Untargeted NMR Based Metabolomics.,"Precision medicine may significantly contribute to rapid disease diagnosis and targeted therapy, but relies on the availability of detailed, subject specific, clinical information. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (??H???NMR) spectroscopy of body fluids can extract individual metabolic fingerprints. Herein, we studied 64 patients admitted to the Florence main hospital emergency room with severe abdominal pain. A blood sample was drawn from each patient at admission, and the corresponding sera underwent ??H???NMR metabolomics fingerprinting. Unsupervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis showed a significant discrimination between a group of patients with symptoms of upper abdominal pain and a second group consisting of patients with diffuse abdominal/intestinal pain. Prompted by this observation, supervised statistical analysis (Orthogonal Partial Least Squares???Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA)) showed a very good discrimination (>90%) between the two groups of symptoms. This is a surprising finding, given that neither of the two symptoms points directly to a specific disease among those studied here. Actually herein, upper abdominal pain may result from either symptomatic gallstones, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis, while diffuse abdominal/intestinal pain may result from either intestinal ischemia, strangulated obstruction, or mechanical obstruction. Although limited by the small number of samples from each of these six conditions, discrimination of these diseases was attempted. In the first symptom group, >70% discrimination accuracy was obtained among symptomatic gallstones, pancreatitis, and cholecystitis, while for the second symptom group >85% classification accuracy was obtained for intestinal ischemia, strangulated obstruction, and mechanical obstruction. No single metabolite stands up as a possible biomarker for any of these diseases, while the contribution of the whole ??H???NMR serum fingerprint seems to be a promising candidate, to be confirmed on larger cohorts, as a first-line discriminator for these diseases."
5,Characterization and ontogenetic development of digestive enzymes in Pacific bluefin tuna Thunnus orientalis larvae.,"The major digestive enzymes in Pacific bluefin tuna Thunnus orientalis larvae were characterized, and the physiological characteristics of the enzymes during early ontogeny were clarified using biochemical and molecular approaches. The maximum activity of trypsin (Try), chymotrypsin (Ct) and amylase (Amy) was observed at pH 6-11, 8-11 and 6-9, respectively. Maximum activity of Try, Ct and Amy occurred at 50 ??C, that of lipase (Lip) was at 60 ??C and that of pepsin (Pep) was at 40-50 ??C. These pH and thermal profiles were similar to those for other fish species but differed from those previously reported for adult bluefin tuna. Enzyme activity for all enzymes assayed was found to decrease at high temperatures (Try, Ct, Amy and Pep: 50 ??C; Lip: 40 ??C), which is similar to findings for other fish species with one marked exception-increased Try activity was observed at 40 ??C. Lip activity appeared to be dependent on bile salts under our assay conditions, resulting in a significant increase in activity in the presence of bile salts. Ontogenetic changes in pancreatic digestive enzymes showed similar gene expression patterns to those of other fish species, whereas marked temporal increases in enzyme activities were observed at 10-12 days post hatching (dph), coinciding with previously reported timing of the development of the pyloric caeca in bluefin tuna larvae. However, complete development of digestive function was indicated by the high pep gene expression from 19 dph, which contradicts the profile of Pep activity and previously reported development timing of the gastric gland. These findings contribute to the general knowledge of bluefin tuna larval digestive system development."
5,Digestive tract ontogeny of Dicentrarchus labrax: implication in osmoregulation.,"The ontogeny of the digestive tract (DT) and of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase localization was investigated during the early postembryonic development (from yolk sac larva to juvenile) of the euryhaline teleost Dicentrarchus labrax reared at two salinities: seawater and diluted seawater. Histology, electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry were used to determine the presence and differentiation of ion transporting cells. At hatching, the DT is an undifferentiated straight tube over the yolk sac. At the mouth opening (day 5), it comprises six segments: buccopharynx, esophagus, stomach, anterior intestine, posterior intestine and rectum, well differentiated at the juvenile stage (day 72). The enterocytes displayed ultrastructural features similar to those of mitochondria-rich cells known to be involved in active ion transport. At hatching, ion transporting cells lining the intestine and the rectum exhibited a Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity which increased mainly after the larva/juvenile (20 mm) metamorphic transition. The immunofluorescence intensity was dependent upon the stage of development of the gut as well as on the histological configuration of the analyzed segment. The appearance and distribution of enteric ionocytes and the implication of the DT in osmoregulation are discussed."
5,Hansen's disease and the digestive system: clinical symptoms and gastric secretory profile at baseline conditions and following maximum stimulation with pentagastrin.,"The incidence of digestive symptoms in 100 patients with Hansen's disease was evaluated in this study, following a standardized questionnaire. A correlation between the frequency of symptoms, the form of the disease, and the length of treatment was investigated. Digestive symptoms were found in 31 patients (31%). No statistically significant difference was found between the presence of symptoms and the length of the disease or between the multibacillary and the paucibacillary form of the disease. However, a positive correlation between digestive symptoms and Hansen's disease was found in the multibacillary form of the disease only for patients treated for more than 12 months. Baseline and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion was studied in 30 Hansen's disease patients and in 10 controls. A Iower basal acid output was observed in patients with Hansen's disease, but no statistical difference was found. Pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion was statistically different in Hansen's disease patients, as compared to controls. A Iower pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion was found in Hansen's disease patients under treatment, as compared to untreated patients, but the difference was not statistically significant."
5,Digestive health in pregnancy.,Women experience the physiological changes of pregnancy in a variety of ways. Changes in pregnancy are associated with changing hormone levels. These hormonal changes have an impact on all body systems. Midwives need to have an understanding of the changes so that they can enable women to manage their digestive health effectively. The midwife needs to be vigilant in history taking to understand the woman's experiences and to be able to offer appropriate support and advice. There are a number of conventional and alternative treatments that can help to prevent and alleviate symptoms. This article will consider the impact on the gastro-intestinal system and how changes can be managed.
5,Patient perceptions of stool DNA testing for pan-digestive cancer screening: a survey questionnaire.,"To explore patient interest in a potential multi-organ stool-DNA test (MUST) for pan-digestive cancer screening.A questionnaire was designed and mailed to 1200 randomly-selected patients from the Mayo Clinic registry. The 29-item survey questionnaire included items related to demographics, knowledge of digestive cancers, personal and family history of cancer, personal concern of cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening behavior, interest in MUST, importance of test features in a cancer screening tool, and comparison of MUST with available CRC screening tests. All responses were summarized descriptively. ??(2) and Rank Sum Test were used for categorical and continuous variables, respectively.Completed surveys were returned by 434 (29% aged 50-59, 37% 60-69, 34% 70-79, 52% women). Most participants (98%) responded they would use MUST. In order of importance, respondents rated multi-cancer detection, absence of bowel preparation, safety and noninvasiveness as most attractive characteristics. For CRC screening, MUST was preferred over colorectal-only stool-DNA testing (53%), occult blood testing (75%), colonoscopy (84%), sigmoidoscopy (91%), and barium enema (95%), P < 0.0001 for each. Among those not previously screened, most (96%) indicated they would use MUST if available. Respondents were confident in their ability to follow instructions to perform MUST (98%). Only 9% of respondents indicated that fear of finding cancer was a concern with MUST, and only 3% indicated unpleasantness of stool sampling as a potential barrier.Patients are receptive to the concept of MUST, preferred MUST over conventional CRC screening modalities and valued its potential feature of multi-cancer detection."
5,The galectin family and digestive disease.,"The soluble-type lectins or galectins constitute a family of proteins defined by shared consensus amino acid sequence and affinity for beta-galactose-containing oligosaccharides. These molecules are widely distributed in the animal kingdom; to date, 15 mammalian galectins have been described but more are likely to be discovered. These proteins are involved in many biological processes including cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, growth regulation, signaling, and cytokine secretion. Over the last decade, a vast amount of reports has shown the importance of several galectins in the development and progression of malignancies in the digestive tract, mainly colorectal cancers. More recent data indicate that some of these molecules are also involved in inflammatory bowel diseases. This review focuses on the current knowledge of galectin expression and putative functions in the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon. It also highlights that the rapid accumulation of research data promises future scenarios in which individual members of the galectin family and/or their ligands will be used as diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for neoplastic as well as inflammatory disorders. However, the concretization of these potential modalities requires substantial improvements in terms of standardization of galectin expression evaluation together with prospective validation of the present data."
5,"Modulation of antioxidant defences in digestive gland of Perna viridis (L.), on mercury exposures.","Sub-lethal effects of mercury exposure (110th of LC(50), i.e. 0.045 mg l(-1)) for 5, 10 and 15 d was investigated on oxidative stress parameters and antioxidant defences in digestive gland of Perna viridis. In addition to this an in vitro effect of mercury single and supplemented with reduced glutathione on lipid peroxidation was studied. Increased lipid peroxidation (during first 10 days and also during in vitro exposures), protein carbonyl and hydrogen peroxides (from 5th till last day of exposure) indicate the resultant oxidative stress in the mercury exposed specimen. DNA damage (F-value) response although less distinct on 5th and 15th d, its low values on 10th d and significant correlation with hydrogen peroxide suggests the toxic role of free radicals towards DNA integrity. Superoxide dismutase, which remains low initially (5th d) and increases later suggests its immediate response against superoxide radical. Higher activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase on 15th d and glutathione-S-tranferase from 10th d onwards suggests the adaptive behaviour of the tissue against oxyradicals. Increasing levels of non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules, such as reduced glutathione and ascorbic acid indicated its involvement in counteracting oxidative damage. Further role of reduced glutathione in reducing Hg toxicity is evident in in vitro experiments where lipid peroxidation remains low in mercury concentrations supplemented with reduced glutathione. The elevated levels of metallothionein from 5th to 10th d suggest involvement of this protein in detoxification of reactive oxygen species and toxic metal. The above results suggest that both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants play an important role in protecting cell against Hg toxicity, which can be used as a biomarker of metal contamination in aquatic environment."
5,Occupational asbestos exposure and digestive cancers - a cohort study.,"Although the role of asbestos in the genesis of mesothelioma and primary bronchopulmonary cancers has been established, results from studies focusing on the relationship between occupational exposure to asbestos and digestive cancer remain contradictory.To determine whether occupational asbestos exposure increases the incidence of digestive cancers.Our study was a retrospective morbidity study based on 2024 subjects occupationally exposed to asbestos. The incidence of digestive cancer was calculated from 1st January 1978 to 31st December 2004 and compared with levels among the local general population using Standardized Incidence Ratios. Asbestos exposure was assessed using the company's job exposure matrix.Eighty-five cases of digestive cancer were observed within our cohort, for an expected number of 66.90 (SIR = 1.27 [1.01; 1.57]). A significantly elevated incidence, particularly notable among women, was observed for peritoneal mesothelioma, independently of exposure levels. A significantly elevated incidence was also noted among men for cancer of small intestine and oesophagus, for cumulative exposure indexes for asbestos above 80 fibres/mL x years. A significantly elevated incidence of cancer of the small intestine was also observed among men having been exposed to asbestos for periods in excess of 25 years and for mean exposure levels in excess of 4 fibres/mL.This study suggests the existence of a relationship between exposure to asbestos and cancer of the small intestine and of the oesophagus in men."
5,Reversible alterations in epithelial cell turnover in digestive gland of winkles (Littorina littorea) exposed to cadmium and their implications for biomarker measurements.,"In marine molluscs, the epithelium of the digestive gland is composed of two cell types, namely, digestive and basophilic cells. Under normal physiological conditions digestive cells outnumber basophilic cells, but under different stress situations the composition of the epithelium changes, basophilic cells apparently replace digestive cell. Winkles, Littorina littorea, were exposed to 1.25mg/l Cd for 20 days to provoke cell type replacement. Then, animals were depurated in clean seawater for 10 days to determine whether cell type replacement was reversible. Digestive glands were fixed in Carnoy and paraffin embedded for histological analysis. The volume densities of basophilic cells (Vv(BAS)) and digestive cells (Vv(DIG)) were calculated by stereology on hematoxylin-eosin stained sections. Vv(BAS) increased and Vv(DIG) decreased in Cd-exposed animals. After estimation of cell size and absolute cell numbers, these changes were attributed to digestive cell loss and concomitant basophilic cell hypertrophy but not to increased numbers of basophilic cells. Cell type composition and cell size almost fully returned to normal values after 10-day depuration. Accordingly, PCNA immunohistochemistry demonstrated that proliferating digestive cells were more abundant in winkles exposed to Cd and after 10-day depuration than in control specimens, suggesting that net digestive cell loss was accompanied by increased digestive cell proliferation. Thus, Cd-exposure seems to provoke an enhanced digestive cell turnover in order to cope with Cd detoxification. Intralysosomal accumulation of metals (autometallographied black silver deposits; BSD) was used as a biomarker of exposure to Cd and lysosomal structural changes as an effect biomarker to see whether cell type composition might have any effect on these endpoints. BSD formed around Cd ions, in digestive cell lysosomes of Cd-exposed winkles whereas basophilic cells appeared devoid of them. After depuration, BSD were less conspicuous. Enlarged lysosomes were observed in Cd-exposed winkles, lysosome size returning to control levels after 10-day depuration. Changes in digestive cell proliferation, digestive cell loss and basophilic cell hypertrophy did not apparently affect the biomarkers investigated herein."
5,Intestinal microbiota: its role in digestive diseases.,"It is now well known that intestinal microbiota exerts not only several physiological functions, but has also been implied in the mechanisms of many conditions, both intestinal and extraintestinal. These advances, to the best of our knowledge, have been made possible by the development of new ways of studying gut flora. Metagenomics, the study of genetic material taken directly from environmental samples, avoiding individual culture, has become an excellent tool to study the human microbiota. Therefore, it has demonstrated an association between an altered intestinal microbiota and inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome, perhaps the most extensively studied conditions associated with this particular subject. However, microbiota has a potential role in the development of other diseases; their manifestations are not confined to the intestine only. In this article, an extensive updated review is conducted on the role intestinal microbiota has in health and in different diseases. Focus is made on the following conditions: inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, hepatic encephalopathy, and obesity. "
5,Thiamethoxam and picoxystrobin reduce the survival and overload the hepato-nephrocitic system of the Africanized honeybee.,"Apis mellifera perform important pollination roles in agroecosystems. However, there is often intensive use of systemic pesticides in crops, which can be carried to the colony by forage bees through the collection of contaminated pollen and nectar. Inside the colony, pollen loads are stored by bees that add honey and several enzymes to this pollen. Nevertheless, intra-colonial chronic exposure could induce sublethal effects in young bees exposed to a wide range of pesticides present in these pollen loads. This study was aimed to both determine the survival rate and evaluate the sublethal effects on the hepato-nephrocitic system in response to continuous oral exposure to lower concentrations of neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TXT) and picoxystrobin fungicide (PXT). Exposure to a single chemical and co-exposure to both pesticides were performed in newly emerged honeybee workers. A significant decrease in the bee survival rates was observed following exposure to TXT (0.001??ng a.i./??L) and PXT (0.018??ng a.i./??L), as well as following co-exposure to TXT+PXT/2. After five days of continuous exposure, TXT induced sub-lethal effects in the organs involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, such as the fat body and pericardial cells, and it also induced a significant increase in the hemocyte number. Thus, the hepato-nephrocitic system (HNS) reached the greatest level of activity of pericardial cells as an attempt to eliminate this toxic compound from hemolymph. The HNS was activated at low levels by PXT without an increase in the hemocyte number; however, the mobilization of neutral glycoconjugates from the trophocytes of the fat body was prominent only in this group. TXT and PXT co-exposure induced intermediary morphological effects in trophocytes and pericardial cells, but oenocytes from the fat body presented with atypical cytoplasm granulation only in this group. These data showed that the realistic concentrations of these pesticides are harmful to newly emerged Africanized honeybees, indicating that intra-colonial chronic exposure drastically reduces the longevity of bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticide (TXT) and the fungicide strobilurin (PXT) as in single and co-exposure. Additionally, the sublethal effects observed in the organs constituting the HNS suggest that the activation of this system, even during exposure to low concentrations of theses pesticides, is an attempt to maintain homeostasis of the bees. These data together are alarming because these pesticides can affect the performance of the entire colony."
5,Lipolysis of the semi-solid self-emulsifying excipient Gelucire 44/14 by digestive lipases.,"Gelucire 44/14 is a semi-solid self-emulsifying excipient used for the oral delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. It is composed of C8-C18 acylglycerols and PEG-32 esters, all of which are potential substrates for digestive lipases. Here we studied the lipolysis of Gelucire 44/14 by porcine pancreatic extracts, human pancreatic juice and several purified digestive lipases. Human pancreatic lipase (HPL), the main lipase involved in the digestion of triacylglycerols, did not show any significant activity on Gelucire 44/14 or on either of its individual compounds, C8-C18 acylglycerols and PEG-32 esters. Other pancreatic lipases such as human pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (HPLRP2) showed low activity on Gelucire 44/14 although the highest activity of HPLRP2 was that observed on the C8-C18 acylglycerol fraction, which accounts for 20% (w/w) of Gelucire 44/14. In addition, HPLRP2 showed low activities on the PEG-32 esters, whether these were tested individually or mixed together. Carboxyl ester hydrolase (CEH) showed high activity on Gelucire 44/14, and the highest activities of CEH were those recorded on the total PEG-32 ester fraction and on each individual PEG-32 ester, except for PEG-32 monostearate. The highest activity of all the enzymes tested was that of dog gastric lipase (DGL) on Gelucire 44/14, although DGL showed low activity on the PEG-32 ester fraction and on each individual PEG-32 ester. We compared the lipolysis of Gelucire 44/14 with that of Labrasol, another self-emulsifying excipient, which is liquid at room temperature. Human pancreatic juice showed similar rates of activity on both Gelucire 44/14 and Labrasol. This finding means that these excipients are hydrolyzed in vivo during pancreatic digestion, mainly by CEH in the case of Gelucire 44/14 and by both HPLRP2 and CEH in that of Labrasol, whereas HPL showed very low activities on each of these two excipients. This is the first time the effects of PEG and acyl chain length on the lipolytic activity of digestive lipases on PEG esters have been investigated."
5,Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2015: Pancreaticobiliary update.,"This update critiques the key abstracts relevant to endoscopic evaluation or interventions in pancreatic and biliary diseases that were presented at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2015. We selected 20 abstracts based on their clinical significance, relevance to endoscopic practice and impact on patient management. "
5,Weaning Off Prognosis Factors of Home Parenteral Nutrition for Children With Primary Digestive Disease.,"The aim of the present study was to describe the indications for home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in children with primary digestive diseases and to identify factors associated with weaning off.All the children initially discharged on HPN between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2009, for chronic intestinal failure (IF) were included. The associations between clinical factors and weaning off of HPN were assessed using a multivariable Cox regression model.Among the 151 children (boys?€?=?€?58%) included in this study, 98 (65%) presented with short bowel syndrome (SBS), 17 (11%) with digestive neuromuscular disorders, 14 (9%) with mucosal diseases, 13 (9%) with inflammatory bowel disease, and 9 (6%) with other primary digestive diseases. The probability of survival was ???100%. At the end of the follow-up, the probability for weaning off of HPN was 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.54-0.84) but varied according to the underlying cause of IF (for example, SBS and inflammatory bowel disease had a better prognosis). The median time until weaning off was 21 months (95% confidence interval 18-38 months). Unfavourable prognostic factors for weaning off of HPN included a bowel remnant of <40 cm, the presence of <50% of the colon, and daily lipid intakes >1.5 g ?? kg ?? day. Underlying disease was also associated with weaning off.HPN is a safe therapeutic option for children with chronic IF requiring long-term nutritional management. Prognostic factors for weaning off of HPN were identified, and they highlight the relevance of SBS anatomy and parenteral nutrition caloric intake. The outcome of children on HPN was primarily dependent on the underlying disease."
5,[Fetal digestive tract imaging].,"The exploration of the fetal digestive tract is not systematized and the ends (thoracic oesophagus and anorectal area) are often excluded from the examination excluded from screening. Only the foetal digestive pathology of liquid expression (digestive obstruction, digestive duplication) is easily detected. The most frequent digestive pathologies (oesophagus atresia, anorectal malformation) are still very often a neonatal discovery. With echography or MRI, the antenatal analysis of the digestive tract is optimized by the acquisition of coronal (thoracic oesophagus, small intestine, and colon) and sagittal median cuts (rectal reference mark, sacral concavity). The interpretation of the echosignal of the contents of the digestive tract (liquid or meconial) takes into account the transition periods responsible for the physiological modifications in charge of the modification of images (24-26 WA and 29-30 WA)."
5,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of selective digestive decontamination using oral gentamicin and oral polymyxin E for eradication of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage.","To assess the effectiveness of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) for eradicating carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal carriage.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 7 weeks of follow-up per patient.A 1,000-bed tertiary-care university hospital.Adults with CRKP-positive rectal swab cultures.Patients were blindly randomized (1 :1) over a 20-month period. The SDD arm received oral gentamicin and polymyxin E gel (0.5 g 4 times per day) and oral solutions of gentamicin (80 mg 4 times per day) and polymyxin E (1 x 10(6) units 4 times per day for 7 days). The placebo arm received oral placebo gel 4 times per day and 2 placebo oral solutions 4 times per day for 7 days. Strict contact precautions were applied. Samples obtained from the throat, groin, and urine were also cultured.Forty patients (mean age ?? standard deviation, 71 ?? 16 years; 65% male) were included. At screening, greater than or equal to 30% of oropharyngeal, greater than or equal to 60% of skin, and greater than or equal to 35% of urine cultures yielded CRKP isolates. All throat cultures became negative in the SDD arm after 3 days (P < .0001). The percentages of rectal cultures that were positive for CRKP were significantly reduced at 2 weeks. At that time, 16.1% of rectal cultures in the placebo arm and 61.1% in the SDD arm were negative (odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.74; P < .0016). A difference between the percentages in the 2 arms was still maintained at 6 weeks (33.3% vs 58.5%). Groin colonization prevalence did not change in either arm, and the prevalence of urine colonization increased in the placebo arm.This SDD regimen could be a suitable decolonization therapy for selected patients colonized with CRKP, such as transplant recipients or immunocompromised patients pending chemotherapy and patients who require major intestinal or oropharyngeal surgery. Moreover, in outbreaks caused by CRKP infections that are uncontrolled by routine infection control measures, SDD could provide additional infection containment."
5,"The smooth-hound lipolytic system: Biochemical characterization of a purified digestive lipase, lipid profile and in vitro oil digestibility.","In order to identify fish enzymes displaying novel biochemical properties, we choose the common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus) as a starting biological material to characterize the digestive lipid hydrolyzing enzyme. A smooth-hound digestive lipase (SmDL) was purified from a delipidated pancreatic powder. The SmDL molecular weight was around 50kDa. Specific activities of 2200 and 500U/mg were measured at pH 9 and 40??C using tributyrin and olive oil emulsion as substrates, respectively. Unlike known mammal pancreatic lipases, the SmDL was stable at 50??C and it retained 90% of its initial activity after 15min of incubation at 60??C. Interestingly, bile salts act as an activator of the SmDL. It's worth to notice that the SmDL was also salt-tolerant since it was active in the presence of high salt concentrations reaching 0.8M. Fatty acid (FA) analysis of oil from the smooth-hound viscera showed a dominance of unsaturated ones (UFAs). Interestingly, the major n-3 fatty acids were DHA and EPA with contents of 18.07% and 6.14%, respectively. In vitro digestibility model showed that the smooth hound oil was efficiently hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipases, which suggests the higher assimilation of fish oils by consumers."
5,"Sudden cadmium increases in the digestive gland of scallop, Nodipecten nodosus L., farmed in the tropics.","Cadmium bioaccumulation in Nodipecten nodosus reared on a marine farm in a tropical bay was measured in muscle tissue and the digestive glands in animals ranging from 6 to 16 months. No bioaccumulation tendencies regarding Cd concentration were observed in muscle tissue (below 1 ??g g?????), while in the digestive gland concentrations remained below 5 ??g g????? until the organisms reached 10 months, and reached levels above 10 ??g g????? from 12 months onwards (reaching 27 ??g g?????). This is the same bioaccumulation pattern noted in animals transplanted to a different Cd exposure. Allometry and environmental factors cannot explain this sudden increase."
5,"Association of Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb with protein fractions and sub-cellular partitioning in the digestive gland of Octopus vulgaris living in habitats with different metal levels.","Zinc, Cu, Cd and Pb concentrations were determined in protein fractions of digestive gland and in the whole digestive gland of Octopus vulgaris collected from two areas of the Portuguese coast. Approximately 95% of Zn, 99% of Cu, 85-96% of Cd and 77-86% of Pb were stored in the cytosol, suggesting the predominance of cytosolic proteins in the trapping these elements. Gel filtration chromatography evidenced the presence of two major groups of proteins, with high molecular weight (HMW, 144 000-130 000 Da) and low molecular weight (LMW, 11000-6000 Da). The following metal-protein associations were found: Zn was distributed between HMW and LMW; Cu and Cd in LMW proteins with a minor association with HMW; and Pb in HMW proteins. The strong positive correlations between Cd, Zn and Cu and LMW proteins point to the presence of metalloproteins with high affinity to these elements. A shift was registered between the maximum of the ratio 254:280 nm and metal concentrations in the chromatographic profiles. This shift may result from metallothioneins having a small participation in the metal binding or protein purification was insufficient and various LMW proteins may be interfering."
5,Use of rumination and activity monitoring for the identification of dairy cows with health disorders: Part I. Metabolic and digestive disorders.,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate (1) the performance of an automated health-monitoring system (AHMS) to identify cows with metabolic and digestive disorders-including displaced abomasum, ketosis, and indigestion-based on an alert system (health index score, HIS) that combines rumination time and physical activity; (2) the number of days between the first HIS alert and clinical diagnosis (CD) of the disorders by farm personnel; and (3) the daily rumination time, physical activity, and HIS patterns around CD. Holstein cattle (n=1,121; 451 nulliparous and 670 multiparous) were fitted with a neck-mounted electronic rumination and activity monitoring tag (HR Tags, SCR Dairy, Netanya, Israel) from at least -21 to 80 d in milk (DIM). Raw data collected in 2-h periods were summarized per 24 h as daily rumination and activity. A HIS (0 to 100 arbitrary units) was calculated daily for individual cows with an algorithm that used rumination and activity. A positive HIS outcome was defined as a HIS of <86 during at least 1 d from -5 to 2 d after CD. Blood concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, ??-hydroxybutyrate, total calcium, and haptoglobin were determined in a subgroup of cows (n=459) at -11??3, -4??3, 0, 3??1, 7??1, 14??1, and 28??1 DIM. The sensitivity of the HIS was 98% [95% confidence interval (CI): 93, 100] for displaced abomasum (n=41); 91% (95% CI: 83, 99) for ketosis (n=54); 89% (95% CI: 68, 100) for indigestion (n=9); and 93% (95% CI: 89, 98) for all metabolic and digestive disorders combined (n=104). Days (mean and 95% CI) from the first positive HIS <86 and CD were -3 (-3.7, -2.3), -1.6 (-2.3, -1.0), -0.5 (-1.5, 0.5), and -2.1 (-2.5, -1.6) for displaced abomasum, ketosis, indigestion, and all metabolic and digestive disorders, respectively. The patterns of rumination, activity, and HIS for cows flagged by the AHMS were characterized by lower levels than for cows without a health disorder and cows not flagged by the AHMS from -5 to 5 d after CD, depending on the disorder and parameter. Differences between cows without health disorders and those flagged by the AHMS for blood markers of metabolic and health status confirmed the observations of the CD and AHMS alerts. The overall sensitivity and timing of the AHMS alerts for cows with metabolic and digestive disorders indicated that AHMS that combine rumination and activity could be a useful tool for identifying cows with metabolic and digestive disorders.

5,"Lysosomal responses in the digestive gland of the freshwater mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, experimentally exposed to cadmium.","In order to examine the possible use of lysosomal response as a biomarker of freshwater quality, structural changes of lysosomes were measured by image analysis in the digestive gland of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, exposed in laboratory conditions to cadmium. Mussels were exposed to the metal (10 and 200 microg/L) for 3 weeks and randomly collected after 7 and 21 days. At each treatment day, digestive tissues were excised and beta-glucuronidase activity was revealed in cryotome sections. Four stereological parameters were calculated: lysosomal volume density, lysosomal surface density, lysosomal surface to volume ratio, and lysosomal numerical density. The changes observed in this study reflected a general activation of the lysosomal system, including an increase in both the number and the size of lysosomes in the digestive gland cells of mussels exposed to cadmium. The digestive lysosomal response in zebra mussels was related to exposure time and to metal concentration, demonstrating the potential of this biomarker in freshwater biomonitoring."
5,Abnormalities of digestive tract innervation in rat fetus treated with ethylenethiourea.,"The pathophysiology of abnormalities associated with myenteric plexus lesions remains imperfectly understood. Such abnormalities have been correlated with subocclusive intestinal conditions in children with Hirschsprung's disease, cases of chronic constipation and, postoperatively, in cases of anorectal anomalies. This study evaluated abnormalities of the myenteric plexus in fetus from female rats that received ethylenethiourea.Female rats were exposed to ethylenethiourea on the 11(th) day of pregnancy (experimental group) or to 0.9% physiological solution (control group). Abnormalities were only found in the experimental group. The digestive tract muscle layer was analyzed morphometrically and changes to the frequencies of nerve plexus cells and interstitial cells of Cajal were evaluated, using hematoxylin-eosin, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase and C-Kit, respectively.Muscle and skeletal abnormalities were observed in 100%, anorectal anomalies in 86%, absent tail in 71%, short tail in 29%, duodenal atresia in 5%, esophageal atresia in 5% and persistent omphalomesenteric duct in 5%. Histopathological analysis showed a thinner muscle layer associated with lower frequencies of ganglion cells and interstitial cells of Cajal, in all gastrointestinal tract.Severe nerve plexus abnormalities associated with muscle layer atrophy were observed throughout the gastrointestinal tract in newborn rats exposed to ethylenethiourea."
5,[An analysis of the results of histological and histochemical research on the integumental tissues and the digestive system of nematodes of the suborder Strongylata after the use of anthelmintics].,"The analysis of the action of various anthelmintics on the integuments and digestive system of Strongylate nematodes indicated that all the used agents caused varying structural disorders. The swelling of the cuticle and its detachment from the subcuticle occurred with the overwhelming majority of the anthelminths on the integuments of the Strongylate nematodes. The digestive system showed an ample epithelial vacuolation in the intestinal wall, as well as swelling and destruction in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Almost all the used agent lowered the levels of glycogen and RNA in the tissue of Strongylate nematodes."
5,[Digestive system surgical emergencies in neonates at the University Hospital of Dakar].,"The goal of this study was for the authors to evaluate their series of digestive surgical emergencies in the neonates. It is a retrospective study on 69 babies treated for a digestive surgical emergency between january 1998 and december 2000. Only 52 babies were born in a medical unit. There was one case of antenal diagnosis and 16 of immediate post-natal diagnosis. The babies ages in the delayed cases ranged from 1 to 17 days with a mean of 7 days and medium of 3 and 6 days. The following malformations were diagnosted: 41 anorectal malformations; 11 omphaloceles; 2 laparoschisis; oesophageal atresia in 8 cases; duodenalatresia in 5 cases; hirschsprungs disease in 2 cases. On presentation, 25 patients were dehydrated, 24 had respiratory difficulties, 5 a severe infection and 20 had hypothermia. The post operatives complications were mostly respiratory. Global mortality rate was 44.92%. The delay in diagnosis and hospital care, the occurrance of hypothermia and respiratory complications are the main reasons of this high mortality."
5,"Effect of biological additives on Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) growth performance, digestive enzymes activity and immunology.","Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) has become a commercially important fish species all over the world. High-density aquaculture has led to congestion and contributed to bacterial infection outbreaks that have caused high mortality. Therefore a 56-days feeding trial was conducted to determine the effects of dietary Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (GB-9) and Yarrowia lipolytica lipase2 (YLL2) on growth performance, digestive enzymes activity, innate immunity and resistance to pathogens of A. japonica. Fish growth performance was significantly affected by dietary YLL2 supplementation but not by GB-9. Fish fed diets with YLL2 at 2.0?€?g/kg diet in combination of high and low levels of GB-9 (5.0?€?g/kg and 2.0?€?g/kg) produced the highest growth. For digestive enzyme, lipase and trypsin activities was promoted by dietary containing YLL2, while amylase activities was increased by dietary containing YLL2, GB-9 single or combination. For innate immunity, the mucus lysozyme activity, leukocytes phagocytosis activity and reactive oxygen species level of skin, peroxidase and lysozyme activity of serum were enhanced in fish fed with GB-9 compared to those in control group (p?€?<?€?0.05). The highest resistance to Vibrio anguillarum and Aeromonas hydrophila was determined in fish fed with 5.0?€?g?€?kg<sup>-1</sup> GB-9 + 2.0??g/kg??YLL2. This study demonstrated that GB-9 and YLL2 enhanced non-specific immune defense system of A. japonica, providing them with higher resistance to pathogens. The present results suggested that the combination of these supplements could be considered as potential biological additives for aquaculture farmed fish."
5,[Endoscopy of the lower part of the digestive system].,"Examination of lower part of digestive system by colonoscopy is necessity in occult fecal hemorrhage occurrence, hematochesis, unresolved loss of blood iron and suspicious finding of large bowel X-ray barium study. By therapeutical colonoscopy, haemorrhage from neoplasms and angiodysplastic changes are controlled, foreign bodies are removed as well as routine polipectomics. Balloon dilation of large bowel stenosis, and palliative treatment of unoperable stenoses lead to improvement in quality of life with significant cost-benefit effects. Follow-up of patients on high-risk for colorectal neoplasms increased early diagnosis of neoplasms."
5,[Linear endoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis of diseases of the digestive system].,"This article reviews the recent literature on the role of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) as diagnostic and therapeutic tool, defines it's place in the algorithm of diagnostic procedures and informs how to treat gastroenterologic patients evaluated by EUS. Endoscopic ultrasonography utilizes the technology of endoscopy to introduce high-frequency ultrasound probes in the upper or lower part of gastrointestinal tract to visualize gastrointestinal wall and adjacent structures. Longitudinal endoscopic probe is different, compared to radial probe, and advantage is use of Doppler technique. This method has came out as an important modality for the diagnosis and staging of benign and malignant lesions of the gut wall and surrounding structures of the mediastinum, abdomen and pelvis. It is also used as a diagnostic tool for the evaluation of submucosal masses of the upper gastrointestinal tract and the rectosigmoid, for locating pancreatic endocrine tumors, and for the assessment of vascular disease. The widest application of EUS is, however, in the diagnosis and staging of esophageal, gastric, rectal, and pancreaticobiliary carcinoma. EUS has been shown to change the approach to clinical management in a significant proportion of patients to a less costly, risky, or invasive strategy."
5,"A chitin-binding lectin from Moringa oleifera seeds (WSMoL) impairs the digestive physiology of the Mediterranean flour larvae, Anagasta kuehniella.","Biotechnological techniques allow the investigation of alternatives to outdated chemical insecticides for crop protection; some investigations have focused on the identification of molecules tailored from nature for this purpose. We, herein, describe the negative effects of water-soluble lectin from Moringa oleifera seeds (WSMoL) on Anagasta kuehniella development. The chitin-binding lectin, WSMoL, impaired the larval weight gain by 50% and affected the activity of the pest's major digestive enzymes. The commitment of the digestive process became evident after controlled digestion studies, where the capacity of protein digestion was compromised by >90%. Upon acute exposure, the lectin was not resistant to digestion; however, chronic ingestion of WSMoL was able to reverse this feature. Thus, we show that resistance to digestion may not be a prerequisite for a lectin's ability to exert negative effects on larval physiology. The mechanism of action of WSMoL involves binding to chitin with possible disruption to the peritrophic membrane, causing disorder between the endo- and ectoperitrophic spaces. Additionally, results suggest that WSMoL may trigger apoptosis in gut cells, leading to the lower enzymatic activity observed in WSMoL-fed larvae. Although assays employing an artificial diet did not demonstrate effects of WSMoL on A. kuehniella mortality, this lectin may hold potential for exerting insecticide effects on other pest insects, as well for use in other experimental approaches, such as WSMoL-expressing plants. Moreover, the use of WSMoL with other biotechnological tools, such as 'pyramid' crops, may represent a strategy for delaying the evolution of pest resistance to transgenic crops, since its multiple site targets could act in synergism with other insecticide compounds."
5,Multi-phase postmortem CT angiography: recognizing technique-related artefacts and pitfalls.,"Multi-phase postmortem CT angiography (MPMCTA) is increasingly being recognized as a valuable adjunct medicolegal tool to explore the vascular system. Adequate interpretation, however, requires knowledge about the most common technique-related artefacts. The purpose of this study was to identify and index the possible artefacts related to MPMCTA.An experienced radiologist blinded to all clinical and forensic data retrospectively reviewed 49 MPMCTAs. Each angiographic phase, i.e. arterial, venous and dynamic, was analysed separately to identify phase-specific artefacts based on location and aspect.Incomplete contrast filling of the cerebral venous system was the most commonly encountered artefact, followed by contrast agent layering in the lumen of the thoracic aorta. Enhancement or so-called oedematization of the digestive system mucosa was also frequently observed.All MPMCTA artefacts observed and described here are reproducible and easily identifiable. Knowledge about these artefacts is important to avoid misinterpreting them as pathological findings."
5,Combined effect of biopesticides on the digestive enzymatic profiles of Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guen??e) (the rice leaffolder) (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).,"Plant extracts, especially botanical insecticides, are currently studied more and more because of the possibility of their use in plant protection. Many of the natural plant compounds and organic compounds used in the control of insect pests are known to affect digestive enzymes. When fed a diet of rice leaves treated with botanical insecticides and bacterial toxins in bioassays, activities of the digestive enzymes protease, amylase, and lipase in the rice leaffolder larvae are affected. Digestive enzyme activities were affected by botanical insecticides and bacterial toxins individually and in combination. When combined, the effect was more severe at low concentration. There were statistically significant differences (P < or = 0.05) in enzyme activities in combined and individual treatments. The combination of Btk and botanical insecticides caused a two-fold decrease in enzyme activity even at reduced concentration. Clear dose-response relationships were established with respect to enzyme activity. A synergistic effect of botanical insecticides and bacterial toxins was found when combined in low doses. These effects are most pronounced in early instars."
5,Digestive oncologist in the gastroenterology training curriculum.,"Until the late 1980s, gastroenterology (GE) was considered a subspecialty of Internal Medicine. Today, GE also incorporates Hepatology. However, Digestive Oncology training is poorly defined in the Hepatogastroenterology (HGE)-curriculum. Therefore, a Digestive Oncology curriculum should be developed and this document might be a starting point for such a curriculum. HGE-specialists are increasingly resisting the paradigm in which they play only a diagnostic and technical role in the management of digestive tumors. We suggest minimum end-points in the standard HGE-curriculum for oncology, and recommend a focus year in the Netherlands for Digestive Oncology in the HGE-curriculum. To produce well-trained digestive oncologists, an advanced Digestive Oncology training program with specific qualifications in Digestive Oncology (2 years) has been developed. The schedule in Belgium includes a period of at least 6 mo to be spent in a medical oncology department. The goal of these programs remains the production of well-trained digestive oncologists. HGE specialists are part of the multidisciplinary oncological teams, and some have been administering chemotherapy in their countries for years. In this article, we provide a road map for the organization of a proper training in Digestive Oncology. We hope that the World Gastroenterology Organisation and other (inter)national societies will support the necessary certifications for this specific training in the HGE-curriculum."
5,Two PBDEs exposure inducing feeding depression and disorder of digestive and antioxidative system of Daphnia magna.,"2,2',4,4'-tetrabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-47) and 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) are two typical polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and studies have proven that these PBDs can disrupt the behaviors and physical function of aquatic organisms. However, little is known about the compositional impacts of BDE-47/BDE-99 compound pollution on the feeding behavior of Daphnia magna. In this study, a response surface methodology (RSM) was introduced into the combined toxicity assessment of BDE-47 and BDE-99 on the feeding depression of D. magna. Low concentrations of BDE-47 (9.2?€???g/L) and BDE-99 (5.4?€???g/L) had no effect on the feeding behavior of D. magna; nevertheless, the feeding depression was strengthened, and a concentration-dependent effect was observed with increasing concentrations of BDE-47 and BDE-99. The results of RSM indicated that the mixture of BDE-47 and BDE-99 can enhance their toxicity on the feeding behavior of D. magna. Moreover, real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that the down-regulation of ??-amylase (AMS) appeared in most of the exposed D. magna. However, there were significant different in the gene expression of trypsin, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) between the exposure and control groups. The change in the enzyme activity of AMS, trypsin, SOD and CAT implied that BDE-47 and BDE-99 cause damage to the digestive and antioxidative systems of D. magna. Correlation analysis indicated that a significant positive correlation existed between the gene expression and enzyme activity of SOD and CAT. Our results contribute to the understanding of toxicity caused by BDE-47/BDE-99 compound pollution in D. magna and help to improve traditional toxicity assessment methods for aquatic environments."
5,"Transcriptome analysis of the digestive organs of Hodotermopsis sjostedti, a lower termite that hosts mutualistic microorganisms in its hindgut.","Microorganisms dwell symbiotically in the termite hindgut. In this study, we identified genes that contribute to the role of the host in maintaining this symbiotic relationship with microorganisms. Body tissue and digestive organs (salivary gland, foregut, midgut, and hindgut) dissected from the lower termite Hodotermopsis sjostedti were used for the analyses. The transcriptomes in these organs were investigated using expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis. The cDNA libraries from the salivary gland and foregut included not only cellulase genes, but also several genes involved in glucose production, heme-cellulose degradation, chitin degradation, the innate immune system, and anti-microbial activity. We compared the expression level of these genes in the organs and body by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Real time RT-PCR analyses confirmed that the genes associated with cellulose degradation, innate immunity, and anti-microbial proteins are much more strongly expressed in the salivary gland than in other tissues. Our results identify functional genes used by the host in the termite symbiotic system."
5,Gut microbes limit growth in house sparrow nestlings (Passer domesticus) but not through limitations in digestive capacity.,"Recent research often lauds the services and beneficial effects of host-associated microbes on animals. However, hosting these microbes may come at a cost. For example, germ-free and antibiotic-treated birds generally grow faster than their conventional counterparts. In the wild, juvenile body size is correlated with survival, so hosting a microbiota may incur a fitness cost. Avian altricial nestlings represent an interesting study system in which to investigate these interactions, given that they exhibit the fastest growth rates among vertebrates, and growth is limited by their digestive capacity. We investigated whether reduction and restructuring of the microbiota by antibiotic treatment would: (i) increase growth and food conversion efficiency in nestling house sparrows (Passer domesticus); (ii) alter aspects of gut anatomy or function (particularly activities of digestive carbohydrases and their regulation in response to dietary change); and (iii) whether there were correlations between relative abundances of microbial taxa, digestive function and nestling growth. Antibiotic treatment significantly increased growth and food conversion efficiency in nestlings. Antibiotics did not alter aspects of gut anatomy that we considered but depressed intestinal maltase activity. There were no significant correlations between abundances of microbial taxa and aspects of host physiology. Overall, we conclude that microbial-induced growth limitation in developing birds is not driven by interactions with digestive capacity. Rather, decreased energetic and material costs of immune function or beneficial effects from microbes enriched under antibiotic treatment may underlie these effects. Understanding the costs and tradeoffs of hosting gut microbial communities represents an avenue of future research."
5,"Morphology and ultrastructure of the midgut in Piscicola geometra (Annelida, Hirudinea).","This paper presents information on the organization of the midgut and its epithelium ultrastructure in juvenile and adult specimens of Piscicola geometra (Annelida, Hirudinea), a species which is a widespread ectoparasite found on the body and gills and in the mouth of many types of fish. The analysis of juvenile nonfeeding specimens helped in the explanation of all alterations in the midgut epithelium which are connected with digestion. The endodermal portion (midgut) of the digestive system is composed of four regions: the esophagus, the crop, the posterior crop caecum, and the intestine. Their epithelia are formed by flat, cuboidal, or columnar digestive cells; however, single small cells which do not contact the midgut lumen were also observed. The ultrastructure of all of the regions of the midgut are described and discussed with a special emphasis on their functions in the digestion of blood. In P. geometra, the part of the midgut that is devoid of microvilli is responsible for the accumulation of blood, while the epithelium of the remaining part of the midgut, which has a distinct regionalization in the distribution of organelles, plays a role in its absorption and secretion. Glycogen granules in the intestinal epithelium indicate its role in the accumulation of sugar. The comparison of the ultrastructure of midgut epithelium in juvenile and adult specimens suggests that electron-dense granules observed in the apical cytoplasm of digestive cells take part in enzyme accumulation. Numerous microorganisms were observed in the mycetome, which is composed of two large oval diverticles that connect with the esophagus via thin ducts. Similar microorganisms also occurred in the cytoplasm of the epithelium in the esophagus, the crop, the intestine, and in their lumen. Microorganisms were observed both in fed adult and unfed juvenile specimens of P. geometra, which strongly suggests that vertical transmission occurs from parent to offspring."
5,Digestive toxicity in grass shrimp collected along an impact gradient.,"Ingested pollutants may elicit digestive toxicity following incorporation into consumer tissues. This post-assimilatory toxicity may include tissue damage influencing synthesis of digestive enzymes, gut transit time and absorption of nutrients as well as pollutants by the gut epithelium. This study investigated impacts of chronic field exposure on gut residence time (GRT), feces elimination rate (FER), extracellular digestive protease activities and gut pH in grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio. Adult shrimp were collected from differentially impacted sites within the New York/New Jersey Harbor Estuary and fed prepared meals containing fluorescent or near-infrared markers and analyzed for digestive toxicity. Relationships between digestive parameters and assimilation efficiencies (AE) for Cd, Hg and organic carbon reported previously were also analyzed. Minimum GRT did not vary significantly for field-collected shrimp, but was positively correlated with Cd, but not Hg or carbon, AE. FER was not impacted by field exposure. Digestive protease activities exhibited a marked decrease in grass shrimp from impacted field sites relative to reference shrimp. Relationships between the assimilation of elements and digestive physiology in field-collected shrimp suggest that digestive plasticity (increasing GRT) may be important in compensating for post-assimilatory digestive toxicity (reduced protease activities) in order to maintain nutrient assimilation. Stress-induced variability in digestive function among grass shrimp populations may, in turn, enhance the assimilation of non-essential elements, such as Cd."
5,[Changes produced by trematode larvae in the phospholipid fatty acid composition of digestive gland of the mollusc Littorina saxatilis].,"Lipids of the digestive gland of the mollusc Littorina saxatilis from the White and Barents Seas were studied. Changes of its biochemical composition are discussed in the connection with different temperature of the habitat and with infestation with trematode larvae. Comparative analysis of the fatty acid (FA) composition of each of phospholipids in intact molluscs has revealed essential differences. Phosphatidylcholine and monophosphatidylinositol (MPI) FA did not differ in the omega 3/omega 6 ratio, which is due to their tolerance to the temperature factor, whereas more unsaturated phospholipids--phosphatidylethanolamine (FEA), its plasmalogen form (pFEA), and phosphatidylserine--differed 1.5-2 times in the studied molluscs. Predominance of omega 3 acids in the Borents Sea molluscs undoubtedly is due to the lower habitat temperatures, as it provides a higher fluidity of membrane phospholipids. Infestation affected to the greatest degree the quantitative FA composition in pFEA and MPI. At infestation, out of all considered phospholipids, only in MPI there was revealed a threefold decrease of the content of eikosenoic acid C20 : 1, whereas in all other phospholipids, in the contrary, it increased. Monophosphatidylinositols also differed essentially from other phospholipids by the saturated FA amount, which changed the unsaturation index of these phospholipids. Since the functional significance of this minor phospholipid is determined by its participation in the so-called phosphatidylinositol system of the hormonal signal transduction, it seems interesting to elucidate whether an increase of this membrane phospholipid saturation at invasion affects the reflex connection between signals from receptors located in a parasite and enzymatic processes."
5,"New data about the functional morphology of the chaetiferous leech-like annelids Acanthobdella peledina (Grube, 1851) and Paracanthobdella livanowi (Epshtein, 1966) (Clitellata, Acanthobdellida).","Approximately 130 individuals of Acanthobdella peledina and 100 individuals of Paracanthobdella livanowi were studied. Morphometric measurements were taken to explore the body form. The digestive and the reproductive systems of leech-like annelids were analyzed for the first time in such a high number of specimens. Observation of A. peledina and P. livanowi revealed crucial differences in the reproductive system of the analyzed taxa, mostly regarding variation in the shape of the testisacs and the length of the ovisacs. The results of a digestive system analysis suggest that blood-sucking parasites of the order Acanthobdellida may also lead a predatory lifestyle. The presented findings support the taxonomic division of the order Acanthobdellida into the families Acanthobdellidae and Paracanthobdellidae. Multiple similarities between Acanthobdellida and Hirudinida were also discussed."
5,Prediction of anastomotic leak and its prognosis in digestive surgery.,"Anastomotic leak (AL) is a dangerous postoperative complication in gastrointestinal surgery. The present study focuses on whether our prediction scoring system, ""Estimation of Physiologic Ability and Surgical Stress"" (E-PASS), could predict occurrence of AL and its prognosis in various kinds of gastrointestinal surgical procedures.We prospectively investigated parameters of E-PASS, absence or presence of AL, and in-hospital mortality in 6,005 patients who underwent elective digestive surgery with alimentary tract reconstruction in 45 acute care hospitals in Japan between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2007.Incidences of AL were 19.6% for esophagectomy via right thoracotomy and laparotomy, 11.7% for pancreaticoduodenectomy, 7.4% for low anterior resection, 4.0% for total gastrectomy, 1.8% for open distal gastrectomy, 1.3% for open colectomy, for an overall incidence of 4.1%. The incidence in each procedure significantly correlated with median value of surgical stress score of the E-PASS (R = 0.78, n = 11, p = 0.0048). The incidences of AL increased when Total Risk Points (TRP) of the E-PASS increased; 1.1% at the TRP range of <500, 2.8% at 500 to <1,000, 4.8% at 1,000 to <1,500, and 13.6% at ??? 1,500 (p < 0.0001). In patients who suffered from AL, an in-hospital mortality rate at TRP < 1,000 was significantly lower than that at TRP of ??? 1,000 (1.1 vs. 15.9%; p = 0.00019).The E-PASS, requiring only nine variables, may be useful in predicting AL and its prognosis."
5,Tributyltin (TBT) and dibutyltin (DBT) differently inhibit the mitochondrial Mg-ATPase activity in mussel digestive gland.,"Tri-n-butyltin (TBT) has long been considered as the most toxic among organotins, especially to membrane systems. The partially dealkylated derivative di-n-butyltin (DBT) has up to now received poor attention and, whenever considered, shown to be less toxic than TBT except on the immune system. The present kinetic approach evidences that both TBT and DBT in vitro inhibit the Mg-ATPase in mussel digestive gland mitochondria by a different mechanism. DBT even displays a higher efficiency than TBT (IC(50)=0.32 ??M for TBT vs. 0.19 ??M for DBT) in inhibiting the enzyme hydrolytic activity. Differently from TBT which at high concentrations (>1 ??M) apparently decreases the oligomycin-sensitivity of the Mg-ATPase, DBT at any concentration tested does not affect the oligomycin sensitivity. TBT probably binds to F(0), either in the form of free enzyme or of enzyme-substrate complex (Ki=K'i), acting as non-competitive inhibitor with respect to the ATP substrate. Conversely DBT, which acts as uncompetitive inhibitor of ATP and as competitive inhibitor of Mg(2+) cofactor, may bind strongly to F(1) subunit, thus preventing ATP hydrolysis. The Mg-ATPase inhibition by both organotins warns against a potential threat to crucial cell energy metabolism processes even after years from contamination and partial TBT debutylation."
5,Phylogenetic constraints on digesta separation: Variation in fluid throughput in the digestive tract in mammalian herbivores.,"The relevance of the mean retention time (MRT) of particles through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is well understood and MRT(particle)GIT is an important parameter in digestion models. Solute markers have been used to estimate MRT(solute)GIT (or 'fluid passage') in animals, but the relevance of this measure is less evident and is usually sought in its relation to MRT(particle)GIT. The ratio between the two measures indicates the degree of 'digesta washing', with little washing occurring at ratios of 1, aborad washing at ratios >1 (where the solute marker travels faster than the particle marker), and orad (retrograde) washing at ratios <1 (where the solute marker travels slower than the particle marker). We analysed digesta washing in a dataset of 98 mammalian species including man of different digestion types (caecum, colon and nonruminant foregut fermenters, and ruminants), controlling for phylogeny; a subset of 72 species allowed testing for the influence of food intake level. The results indicate that MRT(solute)GIT and the degree of digesta washing are related to digestion type, whereas variation in MRT(particle)GIT is influenced mainly by effects of body mass and food intake. Thus, fluid throughput and digesta washing emerge as important correlates of digestive anatomy. Most importantly, primates appear constrained to little digesta washing compared to non-primate mammalian herbivores, regardless of their digestion type. These results may help explain the absence of primates from certain herbivore niches and represent a drastic example of a physiologic limitation in a phylogenetic group. More experimental research is required to illuminate relative benefits and costs of digesta washing."
5,"'As above, so below' examining the interplay between emotion and the immune system.","While the concept of a palpable relationship between our mental and physical well-being is certainly not new, it is only in the light of modern scientific research that we have begun to realize how deeply connected our emotional and immune states may be. We begin this review with a series of studies demonstrating how four fundamental emotional responses: anger, anxiety, mirth and relaxation are able modulate cytokine production and cellular responses to a variety of immune stimuli. These modulations are shown to be either detrimental or beneficial to a patient's health dependent on the context and duration of the emotion. We also discuss the reverse, highlighting research demonstrating how the loss of key immune cells such as T lymphocytes in clinical and animal studies can negatively impact both emotional well-being and cognition. Additionally, to give a more complete picture of the manifold pathways that link emotion and the immune system, we give a brief overview of the influence the digestive system has upon mental and immunological health. Finally, throughout this review we attempt to highlight the therapeutic potential of this burgeoning field of research in both the diagnosis and treatment of immune and disorders. As well as identifying some of the key obstacles the field must address in order to put this potential into practice. "
5,Response of digestive gland cells of freshwater mussel Unio tumidus to phenolic compound exposure in vivo.,"The exposure of freshwater mussels Unio tumidus to phenolic compounds (tannic, ellagic and gallic acid) in vivo caused changes in proteins and DNA function of digestive gland cells. The mussels were exposed to various concentrations of tested polyphenols (60, 200 and 500 microM) for 24 and 48 h and their antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects were determined. The number of SH-groups was quantified spectrophotometrically using Ellman's reagent. Oxidative modification of proteins increased in the digestive gland cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The level of nuclear DNA damage was investigated using the comet assay. The results revealed that polyphenolic acids induce single and double-strand breaks in DNA. The highest changes were observed for tannic and gallic acids and the smallest ones for ellagic acid. 1h of DNA repair process was also studied using the same method. The data obtained in this experiment demonstrate that the most effective DNA repair occurs in the cells exposed to phenolic compounds for 24h. A longer incubation (up to 48 h) does not decrease the capacity of the repair mechanism. The antioxidant activity of the tested phenols was analyzed spectrofluorimetrically using a fluorescence probe DCFH-DA (dichlorofluorescein-diacetate). The experimental data showed that the tested acids can act as antioxidants when used at higher doses (200 and 500 microM) against the reactive oxygen species present in the digestive gland cells. The most effective was ellagic acid, also applied at the smallest dose of 60 microM, in comparison with tannic and gallic acids. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that chosen water-soluble polyphenols, which are located in various plant tissues and are also found in the aquatic environment, can influence organisms living in the water. They can be exposed to these chemicals that cause morphological alterations and changes in certain physiological processes in their organs (i.e. digestive gland cells of bivalve molluscs)."
5,Oil sands process-affected water impairs feeding by Daphnia magna.,"Growth in extraction of bitumen from oil sands has raised concerns about influences of this industry on surrounding environments. Water clearance rate (a surrogate of feeding rate by Daphnia magna) in water containing D.??magna exposed to oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) and its principal components, dissolved component (DC) and suspended particulate matter (SPM), was reduced to 72, 29, and 59% of controls, respectively. This study also examined several possible mechanisms for the observed changes algal cell density (i.e., feeding rate). There was no change in the digestive enzymes trypsin or amylase when D.??magna were exposed to DC or SPM; however, exposure to total OSPW reduced trypsin activity. Mandible rolling or post-abdominal rejections, which are indicators of feeding and palatability of food, were not affected by any exposures to OSPW. Beating of thoracic limbs, which provides water flow toward the feeding groove, was reduced by exposure to SPM or total OSPW. Peristaltic activity was reduced by exposure to DC, which then might result in reduced digestion time in D.??magna exposed to DC, SPM or whole OSPW. All treatments caused an increase in numbers of intact algae cells in the hindgut and excreted material. These results suggest that both DC and SPM affect feeding of D.??magna by impairing actions of the digestive system, but most probably not by reducing rates of ingestion."
5,[Repair effect of BMSCs on digestive tract injury].,"To investigate the effect of BMSCs on the repair of digestive tract injury and its mechanisms.Recent literature on the effect of BMSCs on the repair of digestive tract injury was reviewed.BMSCs had the potency of self-replication, proliferation and multipotential differentiation, which played an important role in the repair of digestive tract injury. The probable mechanisms included: BMSCs' ability of migrating to the injured tissue and inhibiting the host immune response; BMSCs' dedifferentiation and redifferentiation; BMSCs' direct differentiation into the epithelial cells or the stem cells of digestive tract; BMSCs' fusion with the stem cells or the mature epithelial cells of digestive tract; BMSCs' participation in the reconstruction of injured microenvironment.BMSCs participates in the repair of digestive tract injury and has a bright future in the treatment of digestive system disease."
5,Genetic Susceptibility to Cardiac and Digestive Clinical Forms of Chronic Chagas Disease: Involvement of the CCR5 59029 A/G Polymorphism.,"The clinical manifestations of chronic Chagas disease include the cardiac form of the disease and the digestive form. Not all the factors that act in the variable clinical course of this disease are known. This study investigated whether the CCR5??32 (rs333) and CCR5 59029 A/G (promoter region--rs1799987) polymorphisms of the CCR5 gene are associated with different clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease and with the severity of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with chronic Chagas heart disease (CCHD). The antibodies anti-T. cruzi were identified by ELISA. PCR and PCR-RFLP were used to identify the CCR5??32 and CCR5 59029 A/G polymorphisms. The chi-square test was used to compare variables between groups. There was a higher frequency of the AA genotype in patients with CCHD compared with patients with the digestive form of the disease and the control group. The results also showed a high frequency of the AG genotype in patients with the digestive form of the disease compared to the other groups. The results of this study show that the CCR5??32 polymorphism does not seem to influence the different clinical manifestations of Chagas disease but there is involvement of the CCR5 59029 A/G polymorphism in susceptibility to the different forms of chronic Chagas disease. Besides, these polymorphisms do not influence left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with CCHD."
5,"Influence of stocking density on growth, digestive enzyme activities, immune responses, antioxidant of Oreochromis niloticus fingerlings in biofloc systems.","A 120-day feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of different stocking densities on growth, the non-specific immunities, antioxidant status and digestive enzyme activities of Oreochromis niloticus fingerlings under a zero-water exchange biofloc system. Tilapias (0.51?€????€?0.05?€?g) were randomly distributed in twelve tanks, each with 300?€?L water. The experimental design was completely randomized using three replications with four treatments 166 orgs m<sup>-3</sup> (LD, low density), 333 orgs m<sup>-3</sup> (MD, middle density) and 600 orgs m<sup>-3</sup> (HD, high density) with glucose added as biofloc groups, and a clear water group without glucose added as a control 333 orgs m<sup>-3</sup>. The fish cultured in LD and MD group showed higher final body weight. For the digestive enzymes, the lipase, trypsin, and amylase activities were all depressed in HD group and control group. Regarding the immune and antioxidant abilities, significantly lower values (P?€?<?€?0.05) of the lysozyme, complement 3, and glutathione were observed for the fish that reared in the control group and HD group. The stress indicator, the cortisol, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and glucose concentrations were also depressed in HD group and control group, meanwhile the alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were all higher in HD group and control group. The significant higher survival was observed in the LD and MD group after Vibrio harveyi challenge test. The results of the experiment indicated that the biofloc in situ had the effects of anti-crowding stress."
5,Field application of autometallography and X-ray microanalysis using the digestive gland of the common mussel.,"The histological and ultrastructural localization of heavy metals in the digestive gland of the mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, was evaluated using autometallography and X-ray microanalysis on epoxy resin sections. Mussels were collected from two populations along Thermaikos gulf (port of Thessaloniki and Halastra) and one population in Strymonikos Gulf (Olympiada). With the use of autometallography, the light and electron microscopic observations indicated that in the digestive gland, the metals are localized in lysosomal structures, such as heterolysosomes and the residual bodies of digestive cells. Through both techniques, mussels collected from the port of Thessaloniki displayed concentrations of metals higher than those recorded in mussels from Halastra and Olympiada. This fact is consistent with other reports indicating a similar distribution of metals in Thermaikos Gulf and Strymonikos Gulf. The results of the study support the use of both techniques, autometallography and X-ray microanalysis, as a suite of stress indices for pollution biomonitoring studies."
5,Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) deficiency in murine digestive tract influences the immune system.,"The gastrointestinal trefoil factor family (TFF1, TFF2, TFF3) peptides are considered to play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the mucosa. The physiological role of TFF2 in the protection of the GI tract was investigated in TFF2 deficiency.TFF2-/- mice were generated and differential expression of various genes was assessed by using a mouse expression microarray, quantitative real time PCR, Northern blots or immunohistochemistry.On an mRNA level we found 128 differentially expressed genes. We observed modulation of a number of crucial genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity in the TFF2-/- mice. Expression of proteasomal subunits genes (LMP2, LMP7 and PSMB5) involved in the MHC class I presentation pathway were modulated indicating the formation of immunoproteasomes improving antigen presentation. Expression of one subunit of a transporter (TAP1) responsible for importing degraded antigens into ER was increased, similarly to the BAG2 gene that modulates chaperone activity in ER helping proper loading on MHC class I molecules. Several mouse defensin (cryptdin) genes coding important intestinal microbicidal proteins were up-regulated as a consequence of TFF2 deficiency. Normally moderate expression of TFF3 was highly increased in stomach."
5,[Autonomic neuropathy--a problem of the circulatory system and digestive tract].,"An autonomic disorder of the circulatory system becomes manifest as aberrant heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity already years before progressing into symptomatic disease, in which case the condition is no longer curable. Diagnosis is based on tests of autonomic nervous system function. The main thing in the treatment is management of risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in addition to enhanced glucose homeostasis. Autonomic neuropathy may also affect the digestive tract and be accompanied by esophageal motility disorder, gastroparesis, diarrhea, constipation or fecal incontinence. It is essential in the diagnosis to exclude other diseases of the digestive tract."
5,Role of the PhoP-PhoQ gene regulatory system in adaptation of Yersinia pestis to environmental stress in the flea digestive tract.,"The Yersinia pestis PhoPQ gene regulatory system is induced during infection of the flea digestive tract and is required to produce adherent biofilm in the foregut, which greatly enhances bacterial transmission during a flea bite. To understand the in vivo context of PhoPQ induction and to determine PhoP-regulated targets in the flea, we undertook whole-genome comparative transcriptional profiling of Y. pestis WT and ??phoP strains isolated from infected fleas and from temperature-matched in vitro planktonic and flow-cell biofilm cultures. In the absence of PhoP regulation, the gene expression program indicated that the bacteria experienced diverse physiological stresses and were in a metabolically less active state. Multiple stress response genes, including several toxin-antitoxin loci and YhcN family genes responsible for increased acid tolerance, were upregulated in the phoP mutant during flea infection. The data implied that PhoPQ was induced by low pH in the flea gut, and that PhoP modulated physiological adaptation to acid and other stresses encountered during infection of the flea. This adaptive response, together with PhoP-dependent modification of the bacterial outer surface that includes repression of pH?€?6 antigen fimbriae, supports stable biofilm development in the flea foregut.

5,"First data on three bivalve species exposed to an intra-harbour polymetallic contamination (La Rochelle, France).","Evaluating diffuse sediment contamination in the environment is a major concern with the aim of reaching a good chemical and ecological state of the littoral zone. In this study the risks of chronic chemical contamination and consequences in the bivalves Crassostrea gigas, Mytilus sp. and Mimachlamys varia were evaluated in coastal environments. The objective here was to understand the anthropological phenomena that affect the functioning of the marina of La Rochelle (semi-closed environment). Harbours seeking ecomanagement accreditations (such as the international reference ISO 14001) constitute zones of interest to implement biomonitoring studies. The biological effects of chemical pollution in the Marina of La Rochelle were studied to develop a multi-biomarker biomonitoring approach on specific marine species of this site. Moreover, a genetic (DNA barcoding) approach was applied to validate the species identity of collected bivalves. Of the three species tested the scallop, M. varia, was the most sensitive to metal exposure."
4,Clinical indications for musculoskeletal ultrasound updated in 2017 by European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) consensus.,"To update the 2012 European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) clinical consensus guidelines for musculoskeletal ultrasound referral in Europe.Twenty-one musculoskeletal imaging experts from the ESSR participated in a consensus study based on a Delphic process. Two independent (non-voting) authors facilitated the procedure and resolved doubtful issues. Updated musculoskeletal ultrasound literature up to July 2017 was scored for shoulder, elbow, wrist/hand, hip, knee, and ankle/foot. Scoring of ultrasound elastography was included. The strength of the recommendation and level of evidence was scored by consensus greater than 67% or considered uncertain when the consensus was consensus less than 67%.A total of 123 new papers were reviewed. No evidence change was found regarding the shoulder. There were no new relevant articles for the shoulder, 10 new articles for the elbow, 28 for the hand/wrist, 3 for the hip, 7 for the knee, and 4 for the ankle/foot. Four new evidence levels of A were determined, one for the hip (gluteal tendons tears), one for the knee (meniscal cysts), one for the ankle (ankle joint instability), and one for the foot (plantar plate tear). There was no level A evidence for elastography, although for Achilles tendinopathy and lateral epicondylitis evidence level was B with grade 3 indication.Four new areas of level A evidence were included in the guidelines. Elastography did not reach level A evidence. Whilst ultrasound is of increasing importance in musculoskeletal medical practice, the evidence for elastography remains moderate.?€? Evidence and expert consensus shows an increase of musculoskeletal ultrasound indications. ?€? Four new A evidence levels were found for the hip, knee, ankle, and foot. ?€? There was no level A evidence for elastography."
4,Development and Reliability of the Joint Tissue Activity and Damage Examination for Quantitation of Structural Abnormalities by Musculoskeletal Ultrasound in Hemophilic Joints.,"Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) is used increasingly to examine hemophilic arthropathy. However, quantitative algorithms to document findings are lacking. We developed and sought to validate a protocol quantifying hemophilic joint abnormalities.Thirty-one patients with hemophilia were examined serially for 2 years with musculoskeletal US (???600 joint examinations and ???6000 images). Based on the spectrum of pathologies, a quantitative algorithm, named Joint Tissue Activity and Damage Examination (JADE), was developed for soft tissue and osteochondral measurements, including power Doppler, using nominal group techniques. To study intra- and inter-rater reliability, 8 musculoskeletal US-experienced hemophilia providers performed anatomic landmark recognition and tissue measurements on 86 images with arthropathic changes, with repetition 1 month later. Twenty-three musculoskeletal US-inexperienced providers performed similar assessments. Inter-operator reliability was established by 6 musculoskeletal US-experienced hemophilia providers, each acquiring images and JADE assessments of 3 hemophilic arthropathic joints. A radiologist and musculoskeletal sonographer functioned as adjudicators. The statistical analysis was performed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Fleiss ??, and Cohen ?? where appropriate.The musculoskeletal US-experienced providers showed excellent intra-and inter-rater reliability for tissue measurements (ICCs, 0.94-0.96). Agreement was good to excellent for landmark recognition (Fleiss ??, 0.87-0.94). Inter-operator reliability was excellent for measurements and landmark recognition (ICC, 0.90; Fleiss ??, 1.0). Agreement with adjudicators was mostly good to excellent. Musculoskeletal US-inexperienced providers showed excellent inter-rater reliability for measurements (ICC, 0.96) and moderate agreement for landmark recognition (Fleiss ??, 0.58).The JADE protocol appears feasible for quantifying hemophilic intra-articular abnormalities. Musculoskeletal US-trained hemophilia providers showed high intra-rater, inter-rater, and inter-operator reliability, supporting JADE as a protocol for clinical management and research."
4,The psychometric properties of the Evaluation of Daily Activity Questionnaire in seven musculoskeletal conditions.,"The purpose of this study is to psychometrically test the Evaluation of Daily Activity Questionnaire in seven musculoskeletal conditions.One thousand and two hundred people with ankylosing spondylitis; osteoarthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; systemic sclerosis; chronic pain; chronic upper limb disorders; or Primary Sj??gren's syndrome completed the Evaluation of Daily Activity Questionnaire, Health Assessment Questionnaire and Short-Form Health Survey v2. We examined internal construct validity using Rasch analysis, internal consistency, concurrent validity with the Health Assessment Questionnaire and Short-Form Health Survey v2. Participants repeated the Evaluation of Daily Activity Questionnaire to assess test-retest reliability.The 12 domains satisfied Rasch model expectations for fit, local dependency, unidimensionality and invariance by age and gender, in each musculoskeletal condition. Internal consistency was consistent with individual use (Cronbach's ???€?>?€?0.90); concurrent validity was strong (Health Assessment Questionnaire:?€?r<sub>s</sub>?€?=?€?0.60-0.92; Short-Form Health Survey v2 Physical Function:?€?r<sub>s</sub>?€?=?€?-0.61 to -0.91) and test-retest reliability excellent (Intra-Class Correlation Coefficient(2,1)?€?=?€?0.77-0.96).The Evaluation of Daily Activity Questionnaire satisfied Rasch model requirements for construct validity and has good reliability and validity in each MSC. The Evaluation of Daily Activity Questionnaire can be used as a measure of everyday activity in practice and research with people with musculoskeletal conditions. Implications for rehabilitation The Evaluation of Daily Activity Questionnaire evaluates users' ability to perform common daily activities (in 12 domains) that were identified as problematic by people with seven musculoskeletal conditions (i.e., osteoarthritis, systemic lupus, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic pain, chronic upper limb conditions, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome). Most patients considered the Evaluation of Daily Activity Questionnaire was the right length and would be helpful for discussing everyday problems with an occupational therapist. The 12 domains have good reliability and validity and can be combined into two components: Self-Care and Mobility. The Evaluation of Daily Activity Questionnaire is suitable for use both in clinical practice and research and a User Manual is available for therapists and researchers."
4,Advanced Hemophilic Arthropathy: Sensitivity of Soft Tissue Discrimination With Musculoskeletal Ultrasound.,"Point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) is increasingly used by hemophilia providers to guide management; however, pathologic tissue differentiation with US is uncertain. We sought to determine the extent to which point-of-care musculoskeletal US can identify and discriminate pathologic soft tissue changes in hemophilic arthropathy.Thirty-six adult patients with hemophilia A/B were prospectively enrolled. Point-of-care musculoskeletal US examinations were performed on arthropathic joints (16 knees, 10 ankles, and 10 elbows) using standard views by a musculoskeletal US-trained and certified hematologist, who recorded abnormal intra-articular soft tissue accumulation. Within 3 days, magnetic resonance imaging was performed using conventional and multiecho ultrashort echo time sequences. Soft tissue identification (synovial proliferation with or without hemosiderin, fat, and/or blood products) was performed by a musculoskeletal radiologist. Findings obtained with both imaging modalities were compared and correlated in a blinded fashion.There was perfect agreement between the modalities on the presence of abnormal soft tissue (34 of 36 cases). However, musculoskeletal US was unable to discriminate between coagulated blood, synovium, intrasynovial or extrasynovial fat tissue, or hemosiderin deposits because of wide variations in echogenicity.Musculoskeletal US is valuable for point-of-care imaging to determine the presence of soft tissue accumulation in discrete areas. However, because of limitations of musculoskeletal US in discriminating the nature of pathologic soft tissues and detecting hemosiderin, magnetic resonance imaging will be required if such discrimination is clinically important."
4,Strategies for optimising musculoskeletal health in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.,"We live in a world with an ever-increasing ageing population. Studying healthy ageing and reducing the socioeconomic impact of age-related diseases is a key research priority for the industrialised and developing countries, along with a better mechanistic understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of ageing that occurs in a number of age-related musculoskeletal disorders. Arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders constitute a major cause of disability and morbidity globally and result in enormous costs for our health and social-care systems.By gaining a better understanding of healthy musculoskeletal ageing and the risk factors associated with premature ageing and senescence, we can provide better care and develop new and better-targeted therapies for common musculoskeletal disorders. This review is the outcome of a two-day multidisciplinary, international workshop sponsored by the Institute of Advanced Studies entitled ""Musculoskeletal Health in the 21st Century"" and held at the University of Surrey from 30th June-1st July 2015.The aim of this narrative review is to summarise current knowledge of musculoskeletal health, ageing and disease and highlight strategies for prevention and reducing the impact of common musculoskeletal diseases."
4,Neither got a good bill of musculoskeletal health: a comparative study among medical and dental students.,"It has been well established that musculoskeletal complaints are common among dentistry students. However, data regarding the comparison of overall musculoskeletal health between dental and medical students is scarce. The objective of the current study was to compare musculoskeletal health between medical and dental students.The population of the current study was comprised of fourth- and fifth-year students from medical and dental faculties of the same university who were at least three months in clinical training. Self-administered multi-item questionnaires regarding the musculoskeletal complaints were distributed to these students. A comparative analysis was carried out on the responses derived from the medical and dental students.A total of 219 students completed the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 81.1%. Almost four fifth (80.4%) of the students reported musculoskeletal pain, with frequencies of 85.9 and 75.8% in dental and medical students, respectively (p??>??0.05). Total, upper extremity and neck VAS scores were significantly higher in dental students than those in medical students (p??<??0.01, p??<??0.001 and p??<??0.05, respectively). The rate of mild-severe pain sufferers in the upper extremity was also higher among dental students (p??<??0.001).Musculoskeletal pain is frequent in both medical and dental students. However, the intensity of pain - particularly for the upper extremity and neck - is higher among dental students. The findings of the current study might be attributed to the fact that dental education requires more physical burden during routine clinical training than medical education."
4,"Exercise, fitness and musculoskeletal health of undergraduate nursing students: A cross-sectional study.","To??describe the exercise, physical fitness and musculoskeletal health of nursing students.Nursing students are prone to musculoskeletal disorders restricting work ability. Physical fitness and leisure-time exercise may affect responses to workplace exposures and risk for work-related musculoskeletal disorders.A cross-sectional study.August 2013 - April 2015, a convenience sample of 111 nursing students performed submaximal exercise tests. Nursing work, exercise and musculoskeletal health were surveyed and analysed descriptively.Students' mean age was 30.0 years, 89.2% were female and 20.0% worked in nursing while studying. Highest annual prevalence of musculoskeletal trouble was in low back (45.6%), neck (32.0%) and shoulder (18.5%) regions. Most exercised regularly but did not meet weekly cardiorespiratory, resistance, neuromotor and flexibility exercise recommendations and had poor to average fitness levels. Approximately 40% were overweight or obese; 26.1% had risk for obesity-related disease.Interventions to improve nursing students' physical conditioning before entering the nursing workforce appear warranted.Imbalance between physical work capacity and demanding workloads increases musculoskeletal disorder risk amongst undergraduate nursing students. A large proportion studied reported recent musculoskeletal trouble (particularly low back, neck and shoulder). They exhibited modifiable characteristics of overweight/obese, poor fitness and inadequate leisure-time exercise, predisposing them to work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Undergraduate preparation should raise nursing students' health literacy regarding physical fitness and ways to achieve it, for their musculoskeletal health and work capacity. Improving nursing students' fitness may enhance their work preparedness and help them achieve longevity in this physically demanding occupation. This article is protected by copyright.

4,The epidemiology of work-related musculoskeletal injuries among chiropractors in the eThekwini municipality.,"Chiropractors are a unique group of health care professionals who are at risk for developing work-related musculoskeletal injuries. Diversity of daily practice imposes different physical demands on the chiropractor. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal injuries in chiropractors in eThekwini municipality and selected risk factors associated with these work-related musculoskeletal injuries.The design was a quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive study utilising a self-administered questionnaire, developed specifically for this research. The questionnaire contained sections on personal and practice demographics, with questions pertaining to the single most severe work-related musculoskeletal injury, as well as the second and third most severe work-related musculoskeletal injury.A response rate of 64% was obtained (<i>n</i>?€?=?€?62). The life-time prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal injuries was 69% with a predominance of injuries to the upper extremity (50%) and lower back (28.3%). The hand/wrist was the most common anatomical site of injury (31.5%) followed by the lower back (28.3%). Number of years in practice was considered a risk factor as most injuries occurred within the first five years of practice (41.6%). The majority of injuries affected the soft tissue, including ligament sprains (27.5%) and muscle strains (26.6%) and occurred while the practitioner was performing manipulation (38.2%) of the lumbosacral (80.8%) area with the patient in the side posture (61.5%).The results concur with other studies on work-related musculoskeletal injuries in chiropractors and add insight into risk factors predisposing this population to injury."
4,Regulatory mechanisms and clinical manifestations of musculoskeletal aging.,"Aging is the strongest risk factor for degenerative bone and joint diseases. Clinical therapies for age-related musculoskeletal disorders face significant challenges as their pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unclear. This review article focuses on the recent advances in the understanding of regulatory mechanisms of musculoskeletal aging and their clinical relevance. We begin with the prevalence and socioeconomic impacts of major age-related musculoskeletal disorders such as sarcopenia, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and degenerative tendinopathy. The current understanding of responsible biological mechanisms involved in general aging is then summarized. Proposed molecular, cellular, and biomechanical mechanisms relevant to the clinical manifestations of aging in the musculoskeletal system are discussed in detail, with a focus on the disorders affecting muscle, bone, articular cartilage, and tendon. Although musculoskeletal aging processes share many common pathways with the aging of other body systems, unique molecular and cellular mechanisms may be involved in the aging processes of musculoskeletal tissues. Advancements in the understanding of regulatory mechanisms of musculoskeletal aging may promote the development of novel treatments for age-related musculoskeletal disorders. Finally, future research directions for major musculoskeletal tissues including functional interaction between the tissues and their clinical relevance to age-related musculoskeletal disorders are highlighted in the Future Prospects section. ?? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

4,Surgery Is Physically Demanding and Associated With Multisite Musculoskeletal Pain: A??Cross-Sectional Study.,"Performing surgery involves well-known risk factors for developing musculoskeletal pain. Multisite musculoskeletal pain has shown to have an even higher adverse impact on the individual. We examined prevalence and intensity of multisite musculoskeletal pain in surgeons and identified characteristics associated with two or more painful body sites.Information on sociodemographic, work experience, work demands, health status, physical capacity, and prevalence and intensity of musculoskeletal pain were collected from an internet-based questionnaire in 284 surgeons. Descriptive statistics were used to report prevalence and intensity of musculoskeletal pain. A logistic regression model was conducted to assess the characteristics associated with multisite musculoskeletal pain.Musculoskeletal pain was reported by 93% of the surgeons and 77% experienced multisite pain. The reported median pain intensities ranged from 2 to 4. Multisite musculoskeletal pain was significantly associated with being a female surgeon (OR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.5-7.4), physical work demands (OR: 1.5 95% CI: 1.2-1.7), work ability (OR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.6-7.0), and feeling a sense of heaviness in the head/headache (OR:4.8; 95% CI: 2.0-11.5). In addition, 21%-40% of the surgeons who experienced multisite pain reported that pain influenced their work, leisure time, and sleep negatively.The observed high prevalence of multisite musculoskeletal pain and high pain intensities adds new knowledge to the emerging literature on surgeons' health. In addition, several characteristics, for example, work ability, were significantly associated with multiple pain sites. This is concerning as pain could ultimately shorten a surgeon's career. Therefore, it is pertinent to develop preventive and rehabilitating strategies."
4,Murine models of accelerated aging and musculoskeletal disease.,"The primary risk factor for most musculoskeletal diseases, including osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and sarcopenia, is aging. To treat the diverse types of musculoskeletal diseases and pathologies, targeting their root cause, the aging process itself, has the potential to slow or prevent multiple age-related musculoskeletal conditions simultaneously. However, the development of approaches to delay onset of age related diseases, including musculoskeletal pathologies, has been slowed by the relatively long lifespan of rodent models of aging. Thus, to expedite the development of therapeutic approaches for age-related musculoskeletal disease, the implementation of mouse models of accelerated musculoskeletal aging are of great utility. Currently there are multiple genetically diverse mouse models that mirror certain aspects of normal human and mouse aging. Here, we provide a review of some of the most relevant murine models of accelerated aging that mimic many aspects of natural musculoskeletal aging, highlighting their relative strengths and weaknesses. Importantly, these murine models of accelerated aging recapitulate phenotypes of musculoskeletal age-related decline observed in humans."
4,Health effects of direct triaging to physiotherapists in primary care for patients with musculoskeletal disorders: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.,"Physiotherapists and general practitioners (GPs) both act as primary assessors for patients with musculoskeletal disorders in primary care. Previous studies have shown that initial triaging to physiotherapists at primary healthcare centres has advantages regarding efficiency in the work environment and utilization of healthcare. In this study, we aimed primarily to determine whether triaging to physiotherapists affects the progression of health aspects over time differently than traditional management with initial GP assessment. The secondary aim was to determine whether triaging to physiotherapists affects patients' attitudes of responsibility for musculoskeletal disorders.This was a pragmatic trial where both recruitment and treatment strategies were determined by clinical, not study-related parameters, and was initiated at three primary care centres in Sweden. Working-age patients of both sexes seeking primary care for musculoskeletal disorders and nurse assessed as suitable for triaging to physiotherapists were randomized to initial consultations with either physiotherapists or GPs. They received self-assessment questionnaires before the initial consultation and were followed up at 2, 12, 26 and 52 weeks with the same questionnaires. Outcome measures were current and mean (3 months) pain intensities, functional disability, risk for developing chronic musculoskeletal pain, health-related quality of life and attitudes of responsibility for musculoskeletal conditions. Trends over time were analysed with a regression model for repeated measurements.The physiotherapist-triaged group showed significant improvement for health-related quality of life at 26 weeks and showed consistent but nonsignificant tendencies to greater reductions of current pain, mean pain in the latest 3 months, functional disability and risk for developing chronic pain compared with traditional management. The triage model did not consistently affect patients' attitudes of responsibility for musculoskeletal disorders.Triaging to physiotherapists for primary assessment in primary care leads to at least as positive health effects as primary assessment by GPs and can be recommended as an alternative management pathway for patients with musculoskeletal disorders.NCT148611."
4,[The association of musculoskeletal symptoms with teenage work in Iceland].,"Musculoskeletal symptoms are common in adolescence, and may predispose a person to more occurrences in adulthood. Musculoskeletal problems have increased in the adult work force in recent years, becoming one of the most common causes of workers' disability, particularly among women. However, there is a lack of research on the association between musculoskeletal symptoms and teenage work. The aim of this research is to examine the association between four types of musculoskeletal symptoms (aches in joints and/or muscles, aches in the neck or shoulders, backache, and myalgia) and the level of term-time work among Icelandic teenagers, by gender, age, and educational status of the parents.A survey was carried out in the first half of 2018 amongst 2800 teenagers, aged 13-19, randomly selected from the Registers Iceland. The response rate was 48.6%. The young people were asked how often they had experienced musculoskeletal symptoms in the last 12 months, and then were divided into three groups according to their level of term-time work: non-workers; moderate workers (??? 12 h/w and/or in irregular work); and intensive workers (> 12) h/w and in regular work). A Chi-square test was used to test statistical significance: 95% confidence interval (CI). The results show that intensive term-time workers are more prone to suffer from all four types of musculoskeletal symptoms than non-workers. The association persists for backache independent of demographic factors, and for all measured musculoskeletal symptoms among girls. Conclusion is that the working conditions of Icelandic teenagers need to be improved so that they do not give rise to musculoskeletal symptoms. In particular, the working conditions of young females need to be examined, as well as the conditions that lead to occupational backache."
4,Are perinatal factors associated with musculoskeletal pain across the lifespan? A systematic review with meta-analysis.,"Musculoskeletal conditions are common health issues with great impact on individuals. Although many factors have been associated with the development of musculoskeletal pain, such as perinatal factors, its aetiology is still poorly understood.To systematically investigate whether perinatal factors can increase the risk of having musculoskeletal pain across the lifespan.MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science and EMBASE databases were searched from their inception to December 2017. Descriptors used in our search strategy were related to ""perinatal factors"" and ""musculoskeletal pain"". There were no language, age, sex or date restrictions. Meta-analysis was used to pool the estimates of association between perinatal factors and musculoskeletal pain.Among the six articles included in this systematic review, three were extracted for the meta-analysis. The pooled of three and two studies showed no association between chronic musculoskeletal pain and low birth weight (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.9-3.8, I<sup>2</sup>?€?=?€?0; n?€?=?€?157) or pre-term birth (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.0-4.5; I<sup>2</sup>?€?=?€?78%; n?€?=?€?374) in adults, respectively. Overall, the quality of evidence after applying the GRADE approach was very low across all the studies.In adults, our meta-analysis showed no association between birth weight or pre-term birth and musculoskeletal pain, and the quality of the evidence was very low. Thus, the very low quality of evidence and limited number of studies do not suggest a direct clear association. Further high-quality longitudinal studies accounting for more relevant confounders are needed to better understand the complex mechanism that may operate between perinatal factors and musculoskeletal pain."
4,Epidemiology of paediatric presentations with musculoskeletal problems in primary care.,"Musculoskeletal disease is a common cause of morbidity, but there is a paucity of musculoskeletal research focusing on paediatric populations, particularly in primary care settings. In particular, there is limited information on population consultation frequency in paediatric populations, and frequency varies by age and sex. Few studies have examined paediatric musculoskeletal consultation frequency for different body regions. The objective was to determine the annual consultation prevalence of regional musculoskeletal problems in children in primary care.Musculoskeletal codes within the Read morbidity Code system were identified and grouped into body regions. Consultations for children aged three to seventeen in 2006 containing these codes were extracted from recorded consultations at twelve general practices contributing to a general practice consultation database (CiPCA). Annual consultation prevalence per 10,000 registered persons for the year 2006 was determined, stratified by age and sex, for problems in individual body regions.Over 8 % (8.27%, 95% CI 7.86 to 8.68%) of the 16,862 children consulted with a musculoskeletal problem during 2006. Annual consultation prevalence for any musculoskeletal problem was significantly higher in males than females (male: female prevalence ratio 1.18, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.31). Annual consultation prevalence increased with age and the most common body regions consulted for were the foot, knee and back all of which had over 100 consultations (109, 104 and 101 respectively) per 10,000 persons per year.This study provides new and detailed information on patterns of paediatric musculoskeletal consultations in primary care. Musculoskeletal problems in children are varied and form a significant part of the paediatric primary care workload. The findings of this study may be used as a resource for planning future studies."
4,Recent advances in musculoskeletal local drug delivery.,"Musculoskeletal disorders are a significant burden on the global economy and public health. Advanced drug delivery plays a key role in the musculoskeletal field and holds the promise of enhancing the repair of degenerated and injured musculoskeletal tissues. Ideally, drug delivery should have the ability to directly deliver therapeutic agents to the diseased/injured sites with a desirable drug level over a period of time. Here, we present a mini-review of the current state-of-the-art research associated with local drug delivery and its use for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. First, an overview of drug delivery strategies, with a focus on issues related to musculoskeletal pathology, potential therapeutic strategies, conventional and non-conventional drugs, and various delivery systems, is introduced. Then, we highlight recent advances in the emerging fields of musculoskeletal local drug delivery, involving therapeutic drugs (e.g., genes, small molecule therapeutics, and stem cells), novel delivery vehicles (e.g., 3D printing and tissue engineering techniques), and innovative delivery approaches (e.g., multi-drug delivery and smart stimuli-responsive delivery). The review concludes with future perspectives and associated challenges for developing local drug delivery for musculoskeletal applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Three important aspects are highlighted in this manuscript: 1) The advanced musculoskeletal drug delivery is introduced from the aspects ranging from musculoskeletal disorders, potential therapeutic solutions, and various drug delivery systems. 2) The recent advances in the emerging fields of musculoskeletal local drug delivery, involving therapeutic drugs (e.g., genes, small molecule therapeutics, and stem cells), novel delivery vehicles (e.g., 3D printing and tissue engineering technique), and innovative delivery approaches (e.g., multi-drug delivery and smart stimuli-responsive delivery), are highlighted. 3) The challenges and perspectives of future research directions in the development of musculoskeletal local drug delivery are presented."
4,"Evaluation of the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms, presumptive diagnosis, medical care use, and sick leave among female school meal service workers.","Most of the school meal service workers in Korea are middle-aged individuals. They have high workload, which increases their incidence of musculoskeletal disorders. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of subjective musculoskeletal symptoms, presumptive diagnosis, medical care use, and sick leave among female school meal workers.We analyzed the results of musculoskeletal disease screening of 1581 female school meal workers. The screening consisted of self-administered questionnaire, history taking by occupational physicians, and physical examination. The prevalence of subjective musculoskeletal symptoms, presumptive diagnosis after initial examination by occupational physicians, use of medical care for more than 7?€?days, and sick leave due to musculoskeletal diseases during the past year were evaluated in this study. The relative risk of four outcome indicators of musculoskeletal disorders was compared with respect to potential factors, such as age, subjective physical loading, present illness, injury experience, and type of school, using log-binomial regression.The prevalence of subjective musculoskeletal symptom was 79.6%; presumptive diagnosis, 47.6%; hospital visits over 7?€?days, 36.4%; and sick leave, 7.3%. The relative risk of musculoskeletal symptoms by age (???50?€?years vs <?€?50?€?years) was 1.04 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.09); presumptive diagnosis of musculoskeletal disease, 1.17 (95% CI: 1.06-1.30); hospital visits over 7?€?days, 1.26 (95% CI: 0.85-1.85); and sick leave, 1.17 (95% CI: 1.02-1.34). The relative risk of musculoskeletal symptoms due to subjective physical loading (very hard vs low) was 1.45 (95% CI: 1.33-1.58); presumptive diagnosis, 2.92 (95% CI: 2.25); hospital visits over 7?€?days, 1.91 (95% CI: 1.02-3.59); and sick leave, 2.11 (95% CI: 1.63-2.74).Subjective physical loading was a more important factor in musculoskeletal disorders than the age of female school meal workers."
4,Use of Complementary and Integrated Health: A Retrospective Analysis of U.S. Veterans with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Nationally.,"To partially address the opioid crisis, some complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies are now recommended for chronic musculoskeletal pain, a common condition presented in primary care. As such, health care systems are increasingly offering CIH therapies, and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the nation's largest integrated health care system, has been at the forefront of this movement. However, little is known about the uptake of CIH among patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. As such, we conducted the first study of the use of a variety of nonherbal CIH therapies among a large patient population having chronic musculoskeletal pain.We examined the frequency and predictors of CIH therapy use using administrative data for a large retrospective cohort of younger veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain using the VHA between 2010 and 2013 (n?€?=?€?530,216). We conducted a 2-year effort to determine use of nine types of CIH by using both natural language processing data mining methods and administrative and CPT4 codes. We defined chronic musculoskeletal pain as: (1) having 2+ visits with musculoskeletal diagnosis codes likely to represent chronic pain separated by 30-365 days or (2) 2+ visits with musculoskeletal diagnosis codes within 90 days and with 2+ numeric rating scale pain scores ???4 at 2+ visits within 90 days.More than a quarter (27%) of younger veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain used any CIH therapy, 15% used meditation, 7% yoga, 6% acupuncture, 5% chiropractic, 4% guided imagery, 3% biofeedback, 2% t'ai chi, 2% massage, and 0.2% hypnosis. Use of any CIH therapy was more likely among women, single patients, patients with three of the six pain conditions, or patients with any of the six pain comorbid conditions.Patients appear willing to use CIH approaches, given that 27% used some type. However, low rates of some specific CIH suggest the potential to augment CIH use."
4,Effect of a rehabilitation program on performance-related musculoskeletal disorders in student and professional orchestral musicians: a randomized controlled trial.,"To explore the feasibility of a rehabilitation program and its effect on the performance-related musculoskeletal symptoms and functional limitations of orchestral musicians.Single-blind pilot randomized controlled trial with exercise group and control group.Workplace of professional symphony orchestra and tertiary-level conservatory orchestral musicians.Professional and student orchestral musicians with or without performance-related musculoskeletal disorders.A rehabilitation program including an educational presentation, an 11-week home exercise program and three supervised exercise sessions, versus no intervention.Feasibility measures included adherence and drop-out rate. The Musculoskeletal Pain Intensity and Interference Questionnaire for professional orchestra Musicians (MPIIQM) measured symptom intensity and functional limitations, while the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) measured symptom prevalence and frequency.A total of 30 participants were recruited ( n?€?=?€?15 per group). Exercise group adherence was 97.7% for the supervised sessions and 89% for the home exercise program. There were no drop-outs. Significant group-time interactions were obtained for both the pain intensity (partial ??<sup>2</sup>?€?=?€?0.166; P?€?=?€?0.025) and pain interference (partial ??<sup>2</sup>?€?=?€?0.186; P?€?=?€?0.017) sections of the MPIIQM. Mean (standard deviation) pain intensity score changes from baseline to 11?€?weeks were control group: 0.40 (5.04); P?€?=?€?0.763; partial ??<sup>2</sup>?€?=?€?0.007; and exercise group: -4.07 (5.31); P?€?=?€?0.010; partial ??<sup>2</sup>?€?=?€?0.386. For pain interference, mean score changes were control group: 0.20 (9.10); P?€?=?€?0.933; partial ??<sup>2</sup>?€?=?€?0.001; and exercise group: -9.00 (10.73); P?€?=?€?0.006; partial ??<sup>2</sup>?€?=?€?0.430. NMQ analyses revealed no significant interaction ( P?€?>?€?0.05).Results suggest that the studied program is feasible and effective in decreasing the intensity and functional impact of musicians' symptoms. However, no significant medium-term effect on the prevalence and frequency of symptoms was shown."
4,Decrease in musculoskeletal pain after 4 and 12 months of an aerobic exercise intervention: a worksite RCT among cleaners.,"Prevalence of musculoskeletal pain is high in jobs with high physical work demands. An aerobic exercise intervention targeting cardiovascular health was evaluated for its long term side effects on musculoskeletal pain.The objective was to investigate if aerobic exercise affects level of musculoskeletal pain from baseline to 4- and 12-months follow-up.One-hundred-and-sixteen cleaners aged 18-65 years were cluster-randomized. The aerobic exercise group ( n = 57) received worksite aerobic exercise (30 min twice a week) and the reference group ( n = 59) lectures in health promotion. Strata were formed according to closest manager (total 11 strata); clusters were set within strata (total 40 clusters, 20 in each group). Musculoskeletal pain data from eight body regions was collected at baseline and after 4- and 12-months follow-up. The participants stated highest pain in the last month on a scale from 0, stating no pain, up to 10, stating worst possible pain. A repeated-measure 2 ?? 2 multi-adjusted mixed-models design was applied to compare the between-groups differences in an intention to treat analysis. Participants were entered as a random effect nested in clusters to account for the cluster-based randomization.Clinically significant reductions (>30%, f?€?<sup>2</sup> > 0.25) in the aerobic exercise group, compared to the reference group, in pain intensity in neck, shoulders, arms/wrists were found at 12-months follow-up, and a tendency ( p = 0.07, f<sup>?€?2</sup> = 0.18) to an increase for the knees. At 4-months follow-up the only significant between-group change was an increase in hip pain.This study indicates that aerobic exercise reduces musculoskeletal pain in the upper extremities, but as an unintended side effect may increase pain in the lower extremities. Aerobic exercise interventions among workers standing or walking in the majority of the working hours should tailor exercise to only maintain the positive effect on musculoskeletal pain."
4,Musculoskeletal pain and symptoms in pregnancy: a descriptive study.,"Pregnancy-induced hormonal and physiologic changes increase the risk of musculoskeletal problems in pregnancy. The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive look at the musculoskeletal pain and symptoms experienced during pregnancy.A total of 184 women (mean age 30.9 ?? 5.0?€?years) who gave birth in the obstetrics clinic of a tertiary hospital were included in the study. The participants who had given birth at 37-42?€?weeks of pregnancy (term pregnancy) and aged over 18?€?years were selected for participation. Basic demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants including age, body mass index, weight gained during pregnancy, education level, occupation, parity, sex of baby, and exercise habits were collected from the medical chart and face-to-face interviews. Musculoskeletal pain sites were defined as hand-wrist, elbow, shoulder, neck, back, low back, hip, knee, and ankle-foot in a diagram of the human body. The interviews with participants were performed to assess their musculoskeletal pain separately at each trimester follow-up visit.The most frequent musculoskeletal complaints during pregnancy were low back pain (<i>n</i> = 130, 70.7%), back pain (<i>n</i> = 80, 43.5%), hand-wrist (<i>n</i> = 61, 33.2%) and hip pain (<i>n</i> = 59, 32.1%). The participants experienced musculoskeletal pain most in the third trimester except for elbow, shoulder and neck pain compared with the first and second trimesters (<i>p</i> < 0.05).The results of the study suggest that numerous musculoskeletal problems may complicate pregnancy especially in the third trimester."
4,"The association between multisite musculoskeletal pain and cardiac autonomic modulation during work, leisure and sleep - a cross-sectional study.","The prevention and rehabilitation of multisite musculoskeletal pain would benefit from studies aiming to understand its underlying mechanism. Autonomic imbalance is a suggested mechanism for multisite pain, but hardly been studied during normal daily living. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the association between multisite musculoskeletal pain and cardiac autonomic modulation during work, leisure and sleep.This study is based on data from the ""Danish Physical activity cohort with objective measurements"" among 568 blue-collar workers. Pain intensity scales were dichotomized according to the median of each scale, and the number of pain sites was calculated. No site was regarded as the pain-free, one site was considered as single-site musculoskeletal pain and pain in two or more sites was regarded as multisite musculoskeletal pain. Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured by an electrocardiogram system (ActiHeart) and physical activity using accelerometers (Actigraph). Crude and adjusted linear mixed models were applied to investigate the association between groups and cardiac autonomic regulation during work, leisure and sleep.There was no significant difference between groups and no significant interaction between groups and domains in the crude or adjusted models for any HRV index. Significant differences between domains were found in the crude and adjusted model for all indices, except SDNN; sleep time showed higher values than leisure and work time, except for LF and LF/HF, which were higher during work.This cross-sectional study showed that multisite musculoskeletal pain is not associated with imbalanced cardiac autonomic regulation during work, leisure and sleep time."
4,Towards a toolkit for the assessment and monitoring of musculoskeletal ageing.,"The complexities and heterogeneity of the ageing process have slowed the development of consensus on appropriate biomarkers of healthy ageing. The MRC-Arthritis Research UK Centre for Integrated research into Musculoskeletal Ageing (CIMA) is a collaboration between researchers and clinicians at the Universities of Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle. One of CIMA's objectives is to 'Identify and share optimal techniques and approaches to monitor age-related changes in all musculoskeletal tissues, and to provide an integrated assessment of musculoskeletal function', i.e. to develop a toolkit for assessing musculoskeletal ageing. This toolkit is envisaged as an instrument that can be used to characterise and quantify musculoskeletal function during 'normal' ageing, lend itself to use in large-scale, internationally important cohorts, and provide a set of biomarker outcome measures for epidemiological and intervention studies designed to enhance healthy musculoskeletal ageing. Such potential biomarkers include: biochemical measurements in biofluids or tissue samples, in vivo measurements of body composition, imaging of structural and physical properties, and functional tests. The CIMA Toolkit Working Group assessed candidate biomarkers of musculoskeletal ageing under these four headings, detailed their biological bases, strengths and limitations, and made practical recommendations for their use. In addition, the CIMA Toolkit Working Group identified gaps in the evidence base and suggested priorities for further research on biomarkers of musculoskeletal ageing."
4,Work-related musculoskeletal problems related to laboratory training in university medical science students: a cross sectional survey.,"Work-related musculoskeletal problems impact everyday function, working ability, and quality of life. Unaddressed musculoskeletal problems can lead to major injury and loss of function, contributing to participation restrictions, economic loss and the increasing burden of disease worldwide. Medical science laboratory technicians are not immune with reported work-related musculoskeletal problems between 40 and 80%. Similar data is not available for medical science students, who may be the most vulnerable at the beginning of their careers. This study investigated the prevalence, common sites, impact and potential solutions for work-related musculoskeletal problems in medical science students during their university laboratory training.A Standardised Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was administered to medical science students at a local university in Sydney, Australia, to evaluate the prevalence, site and impact of work-related musculoskeletal problems. Problems were defined as an ache, pain, discomfort or numbness in body regions within 12??months and last 7??days in this period. The questionnaire was administered between April and June 2017.The response rate was 38.2% (n?€?=?€?110/288). Over a third (n?€?=?€?38/110) reported a laboratory related musculoskeletal problem in the last 12??months and just over a fifth (n?€?=?€?24/110) within 7??days. The lower back (30% and 17%), neck (24% and 10%) and upper back (21% and 10%) were the most common sites of problems reported within a 12??month and 7??day period respectively. Problems reported in the lower back, neck and upper back prevented daily activities in the majority of cases (between 63 to 83%) with many seeking physician or health professional assistance (between 13 to 83%). Solutions suggested by respondents included better seating designs, rest periods and education about correct working posture.Some medical science students during their laboratory training are already experiencing high levels of musculoskeletal problems, even before they enter the workforce. While the response rate was low affecting generalizability, the extent of problems limiting activity and needs to seek assistance of those reporting problems is of concern. Strategies are suggested to address ergonomic and postural training, as part of university curriculums, including the identification of problems for early intervention to facilitate sustainable workforces."
4,Current Status of Musculoskeletal Trauma Care Systems Worldwide.,"Although general trauma care systems and their effects on mortality reduction have been studied, little is known of the current state of musculoskeletal trauma delivery globally, particularly in low-income (LI) and low middle-income (LMI) countries. The goal of this study is to assess and describe the development and availability of musculoskeletal trauma care delivery worldwide.A questionnaire was developed to evaluate different characteristics of general and musculoskeletal trauma care systems, including general aspects of systems, education, access to care and pre- and posthospital care. Surgical leaders involved with musculoskeletal trauma care were contacted to participate in the survey.Of the 170 surveys sent, 95 were returned for use for the study. Nearly 30 percent of surgeons reported a formalized and coordinated trauma system in their countries. Estimates for the number of surgeons providing musculoskeletal trauma per one million inhabitants varied from 2.6 in LI countries to 58.8 in high-income countries. Worldwide, 15% of those caring for musculoskeletal trauma are fellowship trained. The survey results indicate a lack of implemented musculoskeletal trauma care guidelines across countries, with even high-income countries reporting less than 50% availability in most categories. Seventy-nine percent of the populations from LI countries were estimated to have no form of health care insurance. Formalized emergency medical services were reportedly available in only 33% and 50% of LI and LMI countries, respectively. Surgeons from LI and LMI countries responded that improvements in the availability of equipment (100%), number and locations of trauma-designated hospitals (90%), and physician training programs (88%) were necessary in their countries. The survey also revealed a general lack of resources for postoperative and rehabilitation care, irrespective of the country's income level.This study addresses the current state of musculoskeletal trauma care delivery worldwide. These results indicate a greater need for trauma system development and support, from prehospital through posthospital care. Optimization of these systems can lead to better outcomes for patients after trauma. This study represents a critical first step toward better understanding the state of musculoskeletal trauma care in countries with different levels of resources, developing strategies to address deficiencies, and forming regional and international collaborations to develop musculoskeletal trauma care guidelines."
4,Work-related musculoskeletal injuries in prosthetists and orthotists in Australia.,"This study aims to determine the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in prosthetists/orthotists working in Australia. Secondary to this, the relationship between work-related hazards and work-related musculoskeletal disorders will be examined.In 2012, a self-report survey was conducted with the prosthetist/orthotist workforce in Australia (N?€?=?€?139, 56% response rate). Data on workplace physical and psychosocial hazards, job satisfaction, work-life balance and musculoskeletal discomfort were collected. Predictors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders were assessed using logistic regression analysis.Prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders was 80%. Gender (???€?=?€?1.31, p?€?=?€?0.030), total weekly hours (???€?=?€?0.9, p?€?<?€?0.010) and physical (???€?=?€?1.91, p?€?<?€?0.010) and psychosocial (???€?=?€?1.28, p?€?<?€?0.010) hazards were all associated with reporting of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Females reported higher levels of work-related musculoskeletal disorder discomfort than males in all body areas.Work-related musculoskeletal disorders prevalence is high in prosthetists/orthotists. This suggests that focus on workplace injury prevention is required. Targeted prevention requires systematic identification and then control of all relevant workplace hazards."
4,Relationship between concealment of emotions at work and musculoskeletal symptoms: results from the third Korean working conditions survey.,"In this study, we explored the relationship between concealing emotions at work and musculoskeletal symptoms in Korean workers using data from a national, population-based survey. Data were obtained from the third Korean Working Conditions Survey in 2011. We investigated the prevalence of three musculoskeletal symptoms (""back pain"", ""pain in the upper extremities"", and ""pain in the lower extremities""). Multiple logistic regression analysis was also performed to determine odds ratios (ORs) for musculoskeletal symptoms according to concealing emotions at work, adjusting for socioeconomic factors. In both sexes, the emotion-concealing group showed a significantly higher prevalence of ""pain in the upper extremities"" and ""pain in the lower extremities"" than the non-emotion-concealing group. For back pain, male-but not female-workers who concealed their emotions showed a higher prevalence than their non-emotion-concealing counterparts; the difference was statistically significant. Adjusted ORs for musculoskeletal symptoms (excluding ""back pain"" for female workers) in the emotion-concealing group were significantly higher. Our study suggests that concealment of emotions is closely associated with musculoskeletal symptoms, and the work environment should operate in consideration not only of the physical health work condition of workers but also of their emotional efforts including concealing emotion at work."
4,Psychosocial job demand and control: multi-site musculoskeletal pain in Swedish police.,"Police have a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. While physical factors contributing to this have been explored, little is known regarding the contribution of the psychosocial work environment. This study explores the association between elements of the JDC model, social support and multi-site musculoskeletal pain among Swedish police.In this cross-sectional study, responses from 4185 police were collected using a self-administered online survey. The survey included questions on the psychosocial work environment and musculoskeletal pain, as well as several potential confounding factors. Logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the degree of association between 1) the indices for job demands, job control, social support and multi-site musculoskeletal pain and 2) the four categories of the JDC model, social support and multi-site musculoskeletal pain.The overall psychosocial work environment of Swedish police was characterised by low control and high social support. Police who reported active and high strain jobs were found to have an increase in the odds ratio for multi-site musculoskeletal pain (OR 1.45 (95% CI 1.08-1.94) and 1.84 (1.51-2.24), respectively). High demands, which is a component in the categories for active and high strain jobs, was also found to be associated with an increase in the odds ratio for multi-site musculoskeletal pain (OR 1.66 (1.45-1.91)). High social support was associated with a decrease in the odds ratio for multi-site musculoskeletal pain (OR 0.72 (0.57-0.86)).The psychosocial work environment should be considered when investigating factors related to the health and wellbeing of police."
4,Musculoskeletal conditions may increase the risk of chronic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.,"Chronic diseases and musculoskeletal conditions have a significant global burden and frequently co-occur. Musculoskeletal conditions may contribute to the development of chronic disease; however, this has not been systematically synthesised. We aimed to investigate whether the most common musculoskeletal conditions, namely neck or back pain or osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, contribute to the development of chronic disease.We searched CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Medline in Process, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science to February 8, 2018, for cohort studies reporting adjusted estimates of the association between baseline musculoskeletal conditions (neck or back pain or osteoarthritis of the knee or hip) and subsequent diagnosis of a chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease or obesity). Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessed study quality. Adjusted hazard ratios were pooled using the generic inverse variance method in random effect models, regardless of the type of musculoskeletal condition or chronic disease.CRD42016039519.There were 13 cohort studies following 3,086,612 people. In the primary meta-analysis of adjusted estimates, osteoarthritis (n = 8 studies) and back pain (n = 2) were the exposures and cardiovascular disease (n = 8), cancer (n = 1) and diabetes (n = 1) were the outcomes. Pooled adjusted estimates from these 10 studies showed that people with a musculoskeletal condition have a 17% increase in the rate of developing a chronic disease compared to people without (hazard ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.22; I<sup>2</sup> 52%, total n?€?=?€?2,686,113 people).This meta-analysis found that musculoskeletal conditions may increase the risk of chronic disease. In particular, osteoarthritis appears to increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Prevention and early treatment of musculoskeletal conditions and targeting associated chronic disease risk factors in people with long standing musculoskeletal conditions may play a role in preventing other chronic diseases. However, a greater understanding about why musculoskeletal conditions may increase the risk of chronic disease is needed."
4,Design and Validation of a Peer-Teacher-Based Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Curriculum.,"To design and validate a peer-teacher based musculoskeletal ultrasound curriculum for radiology residents.A musculoskeletal ultrasound curriculum with hands-on scanning workshops was designed for radiology residents. Prior to the workshops, several residents received 3 hours of hands-on training in ultrasound scanning technique which was overseen by an attending musculoskeletal radiologist; these ""peer teachers"" then led small-group hands-on scanning during the workshops. Participants performed diagnostic ultrasound examinations at the conclusion of the workshops to assess skill acquisition and 2 months following the workshops to quantify skill retention. Participants also completed surveys to determine confidence in performing musculoskeletal ultrasound examinations. Median scores and interquartile range (25-75%) were calculated, and t test was used to compare results.Thirty seven residents from all years of training and six senior resident or fellow peer teachers participated in four workshops. Diagnostic ultrasound images were obtained in 100% at the conclusion of the workshop and in 79% 2 months later. Prior to the workshops, residents reported low level of musculoskeletal ultrasound knowledge (median 2, interquartile ranges 1-2), and low confidence in performing (1, 1-2) and interpreting (1, 1-2) musculoskeletal ultrasound examinations. There was a significant increase in knowledge (3, 3-4) and confidence performing (3, 3-4) and interpreting (3, 3-4) studies following the workshops (p < 0.001 for all comparisons).Hands-on musculoskeletal ultrasound workshops, utilizing a peer teacher led small group format is an effective method of teaching scanning skills to residents. There was excellent skill acquisition, good skill retention, and significant increase in confidence performing and interpreting these studies following completion of the curriculum."
4,Developing a toolkit for the assessment and monitoring of musculoskeletal ageing.,"The complexities and heterogeneity of the ageing process have slowed the development of consensus on appropriate biomarkers of healthy ageing. The Medical Research Council-Arthritis Research UK Centre for Integrated research into Musculoskeletal Ageing (CIMA) is a collaboration between researchers and clinicians at the Universities of Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle. One of CIMA's objectives is to 'Identify and share optimal techniques and approaches to monitor age-related changes in all musculoskeletal tissues, and to provide an integrated assessment of musculoskeletal function'-in other words to develop a toolkit for assessing musculoskeletal ageing. This toolkit is envisaged as an instrument that can be used to characterise and quantify musculoskeletal function during 'normal' ageing, lend itself to use in large-scale, internationally important cohorts, and provide a set of biomarker outcome measures for epidemiological and intervention studies designed to enhance healthy musculoskeletal ageing. Such potential biomarkers include: biochemical measurements in biofluids or tissue samples, in vivo measurements of body composition, imaging of structural and physical properties, and functional tests. This review assesses candidate biomarkers of musculoskeletal ageing under these four headings, details their biological bases, strengths and limitations, and makes practical recommendations for their use. In addition, we identify gaps in the evidence base and priorities for further research on biomarkers of musculoskeletal ageing."
4,Musculoskeletal Problems Affect the Quality of Life of Patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"Musculoskeletal problems are more common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) than in normal elderly, but the impact of musculoskeletal problems on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with PD is unknown.Four hundred consecutive patients with PD were enrolled for the evaluation of musculoskeletal problems and HRQoL. HRQoL was assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, which comprised physical health and mental health.Of the total patients, 265 patients had musculoskeletal problems, and 135 patients did not have musculoskeletal problems. Patients with musculoskeletal problems reported lower levels of HRQoL in terms of physical health than did patients without musculoskeletal problems (p < 0.05). In women, all components of physical health were lower in patients with musculoskeletal problems than in patients without musculoskeletal problems (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, in men, only the bodily pain score of physical health was lower in patients with musculoskeletal problems than in patients without musculoskeletal problems. Mental health and physical health were negatively correlated with depression, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale I & II scores, and pain severity from musculoskeletal problems, in that order (p < 0.01 for all).These results suggest that musculoskeletal problems in patients with PD affect HRQoL significantly, mainly in terms of physical health rather than mental health and especially in women rather than men. Musculoskeletal problems should not be overlooked in the care of patients with PD."
4,Health-promoting Lifestyles of Nurses and Its Association with Musculoskeletal Disorders: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a significant concern for public health, leading to temporary and permanent disability. Health care workers, including nurses, are at high risk for these disorders. This study aimed to assess the health-promoting lifestyles of nurses and their association with musculoskeletal disorders and symptoms.This study explored health-promoting lifestyles and their association with musculoskeletal symptoms in nurses. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 300 nurses working in the teaching hospitals affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), were selected using systematic random sampling. Data were collected by two questionnaires, the Health-promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP) and the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ).Study findings showed that 47% of the study participants had a moderate level lifestyle. In terms of musculoskeletal symptoms, the most prevalent were reported in the back (88.33%), knees (83.33%), and thighs (71%). Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant negative correlations between eating habits and musculoskeletal symptoms and interpersonal relations, while a significant positive correlation was found between nutrition and stress management with musculoskeletal symptoms.Lifestyle variables are a good predictor for nurses' musculoskeletal symptoms. Therefore, knowledge of health-promoting lifestyle behaviors and practice of these behaviors are necessary to reduce musculoskeletal disorders among nurses."
4,The Association Between Musculoskeletal Symptoms and Traditional Chinese Medicine Use Among Chinese Older Adults in the Greater Chicago Area.,"Older adults disproportionately experience musculoskeletal symptoms, which are associated with morbidity and mortality. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an important part of Chinese culture and for millennia have been used to maintain health. This article aims to examine the association between musculoskeletal symptoms and different subtypes of TCM usage. Data were collected through the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE) study, a community-engaged, epidemiological study of a U.S. Chinese population. Review of systems was used to measure musculoskeletal symptoms. TCM use was measured by using a 5-point scale. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to control for potential confounding factors. Of 3,157 Chinese, older adults aged 60 and older, the mean age was 72.8 (<i>SD</i> = 8.3) and 58.9% were female. Older adults with any musculoskeletal symptoms had greater utilization of overall TCM use (odds ratio [OR] = 2.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.76, 2.52]), especially massage therapy (OR = 3.41, 95% CI = [2.51, 4.63]), herbal (OR = 2.68, 95% CI = [2.28, 3.14]), and acupuncture (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = [1.87, 3.32]). However, there was no statistically significant association between the presence of musculoskeletal symptoms and Tai-Chi (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = [0.93, 1.50]). This study demonstrated that musculoskeletal symptoms among Chinese older adults were strongly associated with the use of TCM. Future research is needed to examine the effectiveness of TCM in treating musculoskeletal symptoms."
4,A model for predicting the risk of musculoskeletal disorders among computer professionals.,"This study aimed to develop a model for predicting the risk of musculoskeletal disorders among computer professionals.A preliminary study with a modified Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire was conducted to identify the risk in different body parts of the professionals during their work. A discrete postural evaluation of the dynamic postures involved in the work was assessed using rapid upper limb assessment. Postural, physiological and work-related factors were considered as attributes of the model. The model was developed using various machine learning algorithms, and was then tested and validated.The postural factor of the computer professionals was found to be significantly (p?€?<?€?0.01) correlated with the musculoskeletal disorders. Results of the logistic regression analysis showed that physiological and work-related factors were also significantly (p?€?<?€?0.05) associated with musculoskeletal disorders. The Random Forest algorithm and Na??ve Bayes Classifier predicted the risk of musculoskeletal disorders with the highest accuracy (81.25%).Postural, physiological and work-related factors contribute to the development of musculoskeletal disorders. The Random Forest algorithm or Na??ve Bayes Classifier model developed based on these factors could be used to accurately predict the risk of musculoskeletal disorders among computer professionals at any instance of time, during their work."
4,Musculoskeletal pain and associated factors among Ethiopian elementary school children.,"Ethiopian school children often carry school supplies in heavy school bags and encounter limited school facilities. This stresses their vulnerable musculoskeletal system and may result in experiencing musculoskeletal pain. High prevalence of musculoskeletal pain has been documented, but data on musculoskeletal pain among elementary school children in Ethiopia is lacking. To determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain and associated factors among elementary school children in Gondar, Ethiopia.Cross-sectional study was conducted among children from six randomly selected elementary schools. Sample size was determined proportionally across school grades and governmental and private schools to ensure variety within the sample. Data collection consisted of physical measurements including height, weight and schoolbag weight, and a structured questionnaire on musculoskeletal pain, mode of transport, walking time and school facilities. Data were analysed descriptively and through uni- and multivariate logistic regression model.In total 723 children participated. The overall prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain was 62%, with a significant difference between school types (governmental 68% versus private 51%). Shoulder, neck and lower leg/knee were most commonly reported. Walking to and from school for ???20??min (OR?€?=?€?2.94, 95% CI 2.05 to 4.21) and relative school bag weight (OR?€?=?€?2.57, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.47) were found significantly associated with self-report musculoskeletal pain. Children with carrying heavy school supplies and also walking long duration have a 3.5 (95% CI?€?=?€?1.80-6.95) times greater chance of reporting pain as compared to those who carry lesser weighed bags and reported shorter walking duration at the same time.Prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain was high among children attending public schools and also those who walked a long way to and from school. Long walking duration and relative school bag weight were significantly associated with musculoskeletal pain. These findings can inform policymakers to provide transportation services and other facilities at elementary schools. The findings of this study should be interpreted with caution due to possible social desirability bias with higher prevalence of self-reported pain and more so in children population."
4,Applications of PET-MRI in musculoskeletal disease.,"New integrated PET-MRI systems potentially provide a complete imaging modality for diagnosis and evaluation of musculoskeletal disease. MRI is able to provide excellent high-resolution morphologic information with multiple contrast mechanisms that has made it the imaging modality of choice in evaluation of many musculoskeletal disorders. PET offers incomparable abilities to provide quantitative information about molecular and physiologic changes that often precede structural and biochemical changes. In combination, hybrid PET-MRI can enhance imaging of musculoskeletal disorders through early detection of disease as well as improved diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The purpose of this article is to review emerging applications of PET-MRI in musculoskeletal disease. Both clinical applications of malignant musculoskeletal disease as well as new opportunities to incorporate the molecular capabilities of nuclear imaging into studies of nononcologic musculoskeletal disease are discussed. Lastly, we discuss some of the technical considerations and challenges of PET-MRI as they specifically relate to musculoskeletal disease.5 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 3 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2018;48:27-47."
4,Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Musculoskeletal System: From Animal Models to Human Tissue Regeneration?,"The musculoskeletal system includes tissues that have remarkable regenerative capabilities. Bone and muscle sustain micro-damage throughout the lifetime, yet they continue to provide the body with the support that is needed for everyday activities. Our current understanding is that the regenerative capacity of the musculoskeletal system can be attributed to the mesenchymal stem/ stromal cells (MSCs) that reside within its different anatomical compartments. These MSCs can replenish various tissues with progenitor cells to form functional cells, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, and others. However, with aging and in certain disorders of the musculoskeletal system such as osteoarthritis or osteoporosis, this regenerative capacity of MSCs appears to be lost or diverted for the production of other non-functional cell types, such as adipocytes and fibroblasts. In this review, we shed light on the tissue sources and subpopulations of MSCs in the musculoskeletal system that have been identified in animal models, discuss the mechanisms of their anti-inflammatory action as a prerequisite for their tissue regeneration and their current applications in regenerative medicine. While providing up-to-date evidence of the role of MSCs in different musculoskeletal pathologies, in particular in osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, we share some thoughts on their potential as diagnostic markers in musculoskeletal health and disease."
4,Musculoskeletal pain in Primary Care Physiotherapy: Associations with demographic and general health characteristics.,"Many patients reporting musculoskeletal pain present to Primary Care Physiotherapy with costly comorbid overlapping complaints that remain medically unexplained. These subjective health complaints (SHC) incorporate coexisting multi-site musculoskeletal pain and varied non-musculoskeletal complaints (e.g. anxiety, tiredness). The role of these non-musculoskeletal complaints is acknowledged in spinal musculoskeletal disorders, but less so for peripheral musculoskeletal disorders.This cross-sectional study explored the relationships between self-reported musculoskeletal pain sites, non-musculoskeletal complaints and disability among people reporting spinal or peripheral musculoskeletal pain.Fifty individuals with spinal musculoskeletal pain and fifty with peripheral musculoskeletal pain provided data on disability, number of musculoskeletal pain sites and non-musculoskeletal complaints. Relationships between these variables were examined for each group using Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis.Participants with spinal musculoskeletal pain recorded significantly more pain sites and non-musculoskeletal complaints than participants with peripheral musculoskeletal pain. However, there was no significant difference in disability between the groups. Non-musculoskeletal complaints were significantly associated with disability (correlation?€?=?€?0.41, p?€?<?€?0.01) and number of pain sites (correlation?€?=?€?0.42, p?€?<?€?0.01). Number of pain sites and disability were not significantly associated in either group. Participants with spinal musculoskeletal pain reported more tiredness, dizziness, anxiety and sleep problems. Participants reporting dizziness, anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep problems had higher disability.Further studies must confirm the robustness of these associations, to permit comparisons between clinical and general populations and aid identification of causal factors. Considering SHC within individualised management programmes may improve outcomes."
4,Musculoskeletal Symptoms among Family Caregivers of Community-Dwelling Stroke Survivors in Nigeria.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Caring for stroke survivors may be burdensome with adverse consequences on caregivers' physical health. This study examined the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms and associated factors among family caregivers of stroke survivors in Nigeria. <b>Methods:</b> A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving 90 stroke caregiver and stroke survivor dyads was conducted. Data on the participants' demographics and post-stroke duration were obtained. Seven-day prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms among the caregivers and level of stroke survivors' disability were respectively assessed using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and Modified Rankin Scale. Prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms was presented as percentages while participants' characteristics associated with prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms were examined using inferential statistics. <b>Results:</b> Mean (SD) age of caregivers and stroke survivors was 33.2 (10.7) years and 58.9 (9.7) years respectively. Majority of the caregivers were females (61.1%), and children of the stroke survivors (58.9%). Prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms was 82.2%. The low back was the most affected body region (72.2%) followed by the upper back (40%) while musculoskeletal symptoms in the wrist was least prevalent (3.3%). Female caregivers, caregivers of female stroke survivors and spousal caregivers had significantly higher prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms compared to other categories of caregivers. Only 5 (5.6%) caregivers had however received any training on safe care giving methods while only 21 (28.4%) caregivers with musculoskeletal symptoms had received treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> With the high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms among family caregivers of stroke survivors, effective preventive strategies including training and education as well as timely access to treatment would be required."
4,The Association of Workplace Psychosocial Factors and Musculoskeletal Pain Among Korean Emotional Laborers.,"Many studies have reported negative psychological or physical effects of emotional labor. Relationship between work-related musculoskeletal disorder and psychosocial factors has been reported. To manage organizational and psychosocial factors of musculoskeletal disorder with work place intervention among emotional laborers, the factors contributing to musculoskeletal pain must be identified and clarified.Data from the fourth Korean Working Conditions Survey was analyzed. Based on the questionnaire, we selected emotional laborers and included 3,979 participants, excluding participants whose variables were of interest to the researcher. Weight variable was applied. The association with musculoskeletal pain and psychosocial factors, such as workload, monotonous work, job control, social support, and job satisfaction, was investigated.Univariate analysis demonstrated that there was a statistically significant relationship between social support, job satisfaction, and musculoskeletal pain. In multivariate analysis, job satisfaction showed a strong correlation with musculoskeletal pain at all sites. Social support was significantly associated with backache. Monotonous work seemed to reduce the pain in the neck and/or upper limbs. Job control and work intensity were not significantly associated with musculoskeletal pain.In this study, job satisfaction was significantly associated with musculoskeletal pain, and social support among the social psychological stressors could reduce musculoskeletal pain. However, unlike previously known, the presence of monotonous work resulted in reduced musculoskeletal pain. The results of this study will help to establish the direction of improvement of atmosphere in the workplace to prevent the musculoskeletal pain of emotional laborers."
4,The use of cell conditioned medium for musculoskeletal tissue regeneration.,"Tissue regenerative medicine combines the use of cells, scaffolds, and molecules to repair damaged tissues. Different cell types are employed for musculoskeletal diseases, both differentiated and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). In recent years, the hypothesis that cell-based therapy is guided principally by cell-secreted factors has become increasingly popular. The aim of the present literature review was to evaluate preclinical and clinical studies that used conditioned medium (CM), rich in cell-factors, for musculoskeletal regeneration. Thirty-one were in vitro, 12 in vivo studies, 1 was a clinical study, and 2 regarded extracellular vesicles. Both differentiated cells and MSCs produce CM that induces reduction in inflammation and increases synthetic activity. MSC recruitment and differentiation, endothelial cell recruitment and angiogenesis have also been observed. In vivo studies were performed with CM in bone and periodontal defects, arthritis and muscle dystrophy pathologies. The only clinical study was performed with CM from MSCs in patients needing alveolar bone regeneration, showing bone formation and no systemic or local complications. Platelet derived growth factor receptor ??, C3a, vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and -3, interleukin 3 and 6, insulin-like growth factor-I were identified as responsible of cell migration, proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and angiogenesis. The use of CM could represent a new regenerative treatment in several musculoskeletal pathologies because it overcomes problems associated with the use of cells and avoids the use of exogenous GFs or gene delivery systems. However, some issues remain to be clarified."
4,Reference values and factors associated with musculoskeletal symptoms in healthy adolescents and adults.,"Insufficient attention has been given to individuals who report musculoskeletal symptoms yet experience minimal disability.To examine musculoskeletal symptoms among healthy individuals, and compare demographic, psychological and physical factors between individuals with and without symptoms.Cross-sectional observational study.Data were from the 1000 Norms Project which recruited 1000 individuals aged 3-101 years. Participants were healthy by self-report and had no major physical disability. Musculoskeletal symptoms (ache/pain/discomfort, including single-site and multi-site symptoms) were assessed in adolescents (11-17y) and adults (18-101y) using the Extended Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ-E). To compare individuals with single-site, multi-site and no symptoms, body mass index, grip strength, 6-min walk, 30-s chair stand and timed up-and-down stairs (all participants), and mental health, sleep difficulties, self-efficacy and physical activity (adults), were collected./findings: Socio-demographic characteristics were similar to the Australian population. Twelve-month period prevalence of all symptoms was 69-82%; point prevalence was 23-39%. Adults with single-site symptoms were more likely to be overweight/obese and had lower sit-to-stand and stair-climbing performance (p??<??0.05). Adults with multi-site symptoms were more likely to be female and overweight/obese, had lower mental health, greater sleep difficulties and lower grip strength, 6-min walk and sit-to-stand performance (p??<??0.05). Differences were only observed among 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80-101 year-olds.Normative reference data for the NMQ-E have been generated. Musculoskeletal symptoms are common among healthy individuals. In older adults, musculoskeletal symptoms are linked with overweight/obesity, lower mental health, sleep difficulties and lower physical performance, emphasising the importance of multi-dimensional assessments in musculoskeletal disorders."
4,Multi-site musculoskeletal pain in Swedish police: associations with discomfort from wearing mandatory equipment and prolonged sitting.,"Musculoskeletal disorders are considered as a major issue affecting the health and well-being of active duty police. Discomfort from wearing mandatory equipment and sitting for long periods of time in fleet vehicles are workload factors linked to musculoskeletal disorders in police. This study aims to determine the prevalence of multi-site musculoskeletal pain among Swedish police and to explore the possible association to discomfort experience when wearing mandatory equipment and sitting for long periods in fleet vehicles.In this cross-sectional study responses from 4185 police were collected through a self-administered online survey including questions about physical work environment, mandatory equipment and musculoskeletal pain. Multi-site pain was determined through summing pain sites from four body regions. Binomial logistic regression was performed to explore the association between multi-site musculoskeletal pain: (1) discomfort from wearing mandatory equipment and (2) sitting for long periods in fleet vehicles.The prevalence of multi-site musculoskeletal pain at least 1??day per week within the previous 3??months was 41.3%. A statistically significant association between discomfort from wearing mandatory equipment and multi-site musculoskeletal pain was found; duty belt [OR 5.42 (95% CI 4.56-6.43)] as well as body armour [OR 2.69 (95% CI 2.11-3.42)]. Sitting for long periods in fleet vehicles was not significantly associated to multi-site musculoskeletal pain.Multi-site musculoskeletal pain is a considerable problem among Swedish police and modifying mandatory equipment to decrease discomfort is suggested as a potential means of decreasing the musculoskeletal pain experienced by many police officers."
4,Physical therapists and importance of work participation in patients with musculoskeletal disorders: a focus group study.,"Musculoskeletal disorders are a major health problem resulting in negative effects on wellbeing and substantial costs to society. Work participation is associated with positive benefits for both mental and physical health. Potentially, generalist physical therapists (GPTs) can play an important role in reducing absenteeism, presenteeism and associated costs in patients with musculoskeletal disorders. However, work participation is often insufficiently addressed within generalist physical therapy??practice (GPTP). Therefore, this study evaluates whether GPTs take work participation into account as a determining factor in patients with musculoskeletal disorders, and how this might be improved.This qualitative study consisted of seven focus groups involving 30 participants: 21 GPTs and 9 occupational physical therapists (OPTs). Based on an interview guide, participants were asked how they integrate work participation within their practice, how they collaborate with other professionals, and how GPTs can improve integration of the patient's work within their practice.Although participants recognized the importance of work participation, they mentioned that the integration of this item in their GPTP could be improved. Generally, GPTs place insufficient priority on work participation. Moreover, there is a lack of cooperation between the generalist physical therapist and (other) occupational healthcare providers (including OPTs), and the borderlines/differences between generalist physcial therapy and occupational health physcial therapy were sometimes unclear. GPTs showed a lack of knowledge and a need for additional information about several important work-related factors (e.g. work content, physical and psychosocial working conditions, terms of employment).Although a patient's work is important, GPTs take insufficient account of work participation as a determining factor in the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal disorders. GPTs often lack specific knowledge about work-related factors, and there is insufficient cooperation between OPTs and other occupational healthcare providers. The integration of work participation within GPTP, and the cooperation between GPTs and other occupational healthcare providers, show room for improvement."
4,"The efficacy of 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing in the diagnosis of bacteria from blood, bone and synovial fluid samples of children with musculoskeletal infections.","Musculoskeletal infections are among the most common bacterial infections in children leading to hospitalization, invasive procedures and prolonged antibiotic administration. Blood, synovial and sometimes tissue cultures are essential for the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal infections; 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing is a novel diagnostic tool for the detection of bacteria.While the yield of 16S rDNA sequencing in synovial fluid was previously assessed, data regarding the efficacy of this method from blood samples or partially treated children with suspected musculoskeletal infections is lacking.In this study we assessed the yield of 16S rDNA sequencing in blood, bone and synovial samples of children with musculoskeletal infections.Blood, synovial and bone samples were collected from children with suspected musculoskeletal infections and analyzed for the presence of 16S rDNA, the results were then compared with the benchmark microbial cultures.During the study period, 41 children (18 boys and 23 girls) with suspected acute musculoskeletal infection were enrolled. A positive blood culture was found in 6/31 cases (19.4%) with methicillin-susceptible <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> being the most commonly isolated bacterium. No significant 16S rDNA detection in blood samples was recorded.Synovial fluid culture was positive in 6/28 samples (21%), <i>Kingella kingae</i> being the most common pathogen. When using the 16S rDNA sequencing method, the rate of positive results in synovial fluid was higher with bacterial detection in 12/23 (52%) samples. The 16S rDNA sequencing method was also able to identify pathogens in samples taken from partially treated children where cultures were negative with 16S rDNA detection in 5/5 samples.Although 16S rDNA sequencing may increase the yield of bacterial detection in synovial samples of patients with musculoskeletal infections, there is no benefit from applying this method on blood samples. The 16S rDNA sequencing method may be particularly beneficial when antibiotic treatment was started prior to synovial fluid sampling.Level-II diagnostic study."
4,The Economic Burden of Musculoskeletal Disease in Children and Adolescents in the United States.,"Musculoskeletal conditions are among the most common and costly conditions suffered by Americans. In 2011, there was an estimated $213 billion in annual cost of direct treatment for and lost wages due to musculoskeletal disease in the United States. Data on economic burden, however, comes mostly from the adult population, with significantly less information regarding the burden of these conditions in young patients available. The purpose of this report is to provide data on the economic burden of musculoskeletal diseases in children and adolescents in the United States.Eleven diagnosis categories were identified, with health care visits and hospitalization data derived from ICD-9-CM codes for each of the conditions searched. The largest database utilized was the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). Total visits came from the KID, HCUP NEDS (emergency department), NCHS NHAMCS OP (outpatient), and NCHS NAMCS (physician office) databases. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) child sample was additionally searched to obtain patient/parent-reported data.In 2012, more than 19 million children and adolescents received treatment in medical centers, physicians' offices, and hospitals for a musculoskeletal-related condition. The most common reason for treatment (68%) was traumatic injury, followed by a pain syndrome (13%) and deformity (9%). Total hospital charges in 2012 for children and adolescents with a primary musculoskeletal-related diagnosis totaled $7.6 billion. Trauma (43%) and deformity (38%) were the major contributors to total hospital charges.Although we found that hospital-related charges for musculoskeletal diseases for children and adolescents in 2012 totaled $7.6 billion, this number underestimates the total cost for all pediatric musculoskeletal conditions. Musculoskeletal conditions accounted for 5.4% of hospital charges in the pediatric population. However, only 1.4% of pediatric research funding is designated to musculoskeletal research. Going forward, the data in this report may be used to further research and to stimulate development of better methods with which to measure the direct and indirect costs of musculoskeletal conditions in children.Level IV-economic and decision analysis."
4,Interventional therapeutic procedures in the musculoskeletal system: an Italian Survey by the Italian College of Musculoskeletal Radiology.,"To perform an online survey among all members of the Italian College of Musculoskeletal Radiology to understand how therapeutic musculoskeletal procedures are performed in daily practice in Italy.We administered an online survey to all 2405 members about the use of therapeutic musculoskeletal procedures in their institutions asking 16 different questions. Subgroup analysis was performed between general and orthopaedic hospitals with Mann-Whitney U and ?? <sup>2</sup> statistics.A total of 129/2405 answers (5.4% of members) were included in our analysis. A median of 142.5 (25th-75th percentiles: 50-535.5; range 10-5000) therapeutic musculoskeletal procedures per single institution was performed in 2016. Arthropathic pain was the main indication. The most common procedures were joint injection, bursal/tendon injection, and irrigation of calcific tendinopathy. Ultrasound-guided procedures were mainly performed in ultrasonography rooms (77.4%) rather than in dedicated interventional rooms (22.6%). Conversely, fluoroscopic procedures were performed almost with the same frequency in interventional radiology suites (52.4%) and in general radiology rooms (47.6%). In most institutions (72%), autologous blood or components were not used. The median number of therapeutic musculoskeletal procedures performed in orthopaedic hospitals was significantly higher than in general hospitals (P??=??0.002), as well as for the use of autologous preparations (P??=??0.004).Joint injection, bursal/tendon injection, and irrigation of calcific tendinopathy were the most common therapeutic musculoskeletal procedures, being arthropathic pain the main indication. The percentage of procedures and the use of autologous preparations were significantly higher in orthopaedic hospitals than in general hospitals."
4,Physical-work ability and chronic musculoskeletal complaints are related to leisure-time physical activity: Cross-sectional study among manual workers aged 50-70 years.,"To investigate the associations between both high- and low-intensity leisure-time physical activity on physical-work ability and chronic musculoskeletal complaints among manual workers aged 50-70 years.In this cross-sectional study, 1763 manual workers (mean age 57.1, SD ?? 4.7 years) replied to questions about leisure-time physical activity, physical-work ability, chronic musculoskeletal complaints as well as health and lifestyle factors. Ordinal and binomial logistic regression models were constructed to assess the influence of the duration of both low- and high-intensity physical activity on physical-work ability and chronic musculoskeletal complaints, respectively. Models were adjusted for gender, age, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, physical-work demand, work experience, chronic disease and, regarding physical-work ability, also for chronic musculoskeletal complaints.A statistically significant association between greater physical-work ability and high-intensity physical activity was found for workers engaged in 3-4 h/wk and ??? 5 h/wk (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.15-2.19 and OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.10-2.22, respectively). For both high- and low-intensity physical activity, a duration of 3-4 h/wk was associated with lower odds of reporting chronic musculoskeletal complaints in the knees (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42-1.00 and OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.99, respectively).Engaging in ??? 3 h/wk of high-intensity leisure-time physical activity was associated with greater physical-work ability among manual workers aged 50-70 years. Both high- and low-intensity physical activity related to lower odds of having chronic musculoskeletal complaints in the knees."
4,Association Between Objectively Measured Physical Activity and the Number of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Sites in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.,"Physical inactivity is recognized as a pandemic health problem. The association of pain with physical activity, particularly when measured objectively, in older adults is unclear. This study investigates the association of number of chronic musculoskeletal pain sites and pain severity with objectively measured physical activity in community-dwelling older adults.Observational study.Community.We analyzed 267 community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 75.3?€?years, 67.0% women).Number of chronic musculoskeletal pain sites and pain severity were measured using a self-reported questionnaire. Mean steps per day and mean minutes of light physical activity per day and moderate to vigorous physical activity per day were measured using an accelerometer. Linear regression models were applied to analyze the association of number of chronic musculoskeletal pain sites and pain severity with physical activity.The results suggest that a higher number of chronic musculoskeletal pain sites is associated with lower step count (beta?€?=?€?-333.5, 95% confidence interval?€?=?€?-655.9 to?€?-11.0, P?€?<?€?0.05) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (beta?€?=?€?-2.5, 95% confidence interval?€?=?€?-4.7 to?€?-0.4, P?€?<?€?0.05) even after adjustment for age, gender, years of schooling, obesity, alcohol habits, smoking status, number of comorbidities, recent surgery, and depressive symptoms.Our results suggest that the number of chronic musculoskeletal pain sites is associated with low physical activity in older adults. Therefore, low physical activity due to chronic musculoskeletal pain should not be overlooked."
4,Do Technical Aids for Patient Handling Prevent Musculoskeletal Complaints in Health Care Workers?-A Systematic Review of Intervention Studies.,"The physical load ensuing from the repositioning and moving of patients puts health care workers at risk of musculoskeletal complaints. Technical equipment developed to aid with patient handling should reduce physical strain and workload; however, the efficacy of these aids in preventing musculoskeletal disorders and complaints is still unclear. A systematic review of controlled intervention studies was conducted to examine if the risk of musculoskeletal complaints and disorders is reduced by technical patient handling equipment. MEDLINE<sup>??</sup>/PubMed<sup>??</sup>, EMBASE<sup>??</sup>, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL<sup>??</sup>) were searched using terms for nursing, caregiving, technical aids, musculoskeletal injuries, and complaints. Randomized controlled trials and controlled before-after studies of interventions including technical patient handling equipment were included. The titles and abstracts of 9554 publications and 97 full-texts were screened by two reviewers. The qualitative synthesis included one randomized controlled trial (RCT) and ten controlled before-after studies. A meta-analysis of four studies resulted in a pooled risk ratio for musculoskeletal injury claims (post-intervention) of 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.68-0.90). Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was poor and the results often based on administrative injury claim data, introducing potential selection bias. Interventions with technical patient handling aids appear to prevent musculoskeletal complaints, but the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE approach ranged from low to very low."
4,Self-care of chronic musculoskeletal pain - experiences and attitudes of patients and health care providers.,"Self-care is often the first choice for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Self-care includes the use of non-prescription medications with no doctor's supervision, as well as the use of other modern and traditional treatment methods with no consultation of the health care provider. Self-care may have positive effects on the successful outcome of a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences and attitudes of patients and health care providers to the self-care of chronic musculoskeletal pain.Qualitative Phenomenological study, where the data were collected by the method of an audio-taped interview in 15 patients at the outpatient clinic for pain management and in 20 health care providers involved in the treatment of those patients. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by principles of Interpretative Thematic Analysis.Topics identified in patients: a) positive aspects of self-care, b) a need for pain self-care, c) social aspects of pain self-care. Topics identified in health care providers: a) aspects of self-care, b) a need for self-care c) risks of self-care. Most of patients have positive attitude to self-care and this is the first step to pain management and to care for itself. The most frequent factors influencing decision about the self-care are heavy pain, unavailability of the doctor, long awaiting time for the therapy, or ineffectiveness of methods of conventional medicine. The health care providers believe that self-care of chronic musculoskeletal pain may be a patient's contribution to clinical treatment. However, good awareness of methods used is important in this context, to avoid adverse effects of self-care.Patients understand the self-care of musculoskeletal pain as an individually adjusted treatment and believe in its effectiveness. Health care providers support self-care as an adjunction to clinical management only, and think that self-care of musculoskeletal pain acts as a placebo, with a short-lived effect on chronic musculoskeletal pain."
4,Musculoskeletal pain and menopause.,"Musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia and arthritis are all more common in women, and their frequency increases with age and in some appears to be associated with the onset of menopause. The clinical assessment, investigation and management of women presenting with musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia or arthritis at the time of menopause are reviewed. Common causes of arthralgia and arthritis in this population are discussed. The epidemiological and trials evidence for the effects of hormone replacement therapy on musculoskeletal pain and arthritis (primarily from RCTs of HRT for other menopausal symptoms) are discussed. Lastly, the possible underlying aetiological roles of sex hormones including estrogen, and their deficiency, in predisposing to musculoskeletal pain and arthritis are overviewed. Although the association appears strong, a causal link between estrogen deficiency and musculoskeletal pain or different types of arthritis is lacking; there have been few studies specifically within this group of symptomatic patients, and there is much still to understand about musculoskeletal pain and arthritis at the time of the menopause, and about how we might prevent or treat this."
4,Prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal injuries in health??care workers: the implications for work disability management.,"To compare the prevalence of musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal injuries in a cohort of workers in Manitoba health care sector, who made injury claims between 2002 and 2012. A retrospective study, using secondary data from WCB Manitoba. Logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios for nature of work-related injuries among different groups of workers. Idiopathic work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) constituted 74.6% of all the injury claims. Injury risks varied between worker groups, and a significant difference was found within the female group, ??<sup>2</sup>??=??13.4, p??=??0.0094, but not among the males. Compared to the married, single workers were more likely to experience traumatic than idiopathic injuries (OR??=??1.72, CI, 1.28, 2.29), and much higher risk of traumatic injuries than non-WMSD (OR??=??1.93, CI, 1.31, 2.84). Work-related injury risks vary significantly across occupations and worker groups, with idiopathic injuries being higher in high physical tasks. Practitioner Summary: To compare musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal injuries among workers in health care sector, and explore the implications for work disability management. Retrospective study, using workers' compensation claims data. The risk of idiopathic work-related musculoskeletal disorders continue to be high compared to traumatic and non-musculoskeletal disorders, particularly in tasks that involved high physical activities."
4,"Ergonomic Assessment of Exposure to Musculoskeletal Disorders Risk Factors among Dentists of Shiraz, Iran.","In dental profession, exposure to risk factors of musculoskeletal disorders raises the probability of musculoskeletal injuries in different parts of the body.This study aimed to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), assess the risk of MSDs, and determine the risk factors of musculoskeletal injuries among dentists of Shiraz city.In this cross-sectional study, 136 dentists of Shiraz city were randomly selected. The data were collected by Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire (NMQ). Ergonomic assessment of exposure to MSDs risk factors was carried out by assessment of repetitive tasks (ART) technique. In order to assess dentists' exposure to MSDS risk factors, the method of ART (ART) was adopted. This method has been designed to assess the risk of those tasks that required repetitive motion of upper limb, especially hands and arms. The collected data were analyzed through SPSS software (version. 22). The study regarded p value of <0.05 as significance level.Mean age of the participants was 35.6??8.7 years. The 12-month prevalence of MSDs among dentists was 91.9%. The results suggested that risk of MSDs among dentists was high. The results of logistic regression analyses indicated that female gender (<i>p</i>< 0.001) and exercise for less than 3 hours per week (<i>p</i>= 0.001) played significant roles in occurrence of MSDs among the study population. Additionally, the results of ART assessment revealed that risk of MSDs in the right side of the subjects' bodies was higher.The findings showed that risk of MSDs and their prevalence in the study population was high with significant association. Based on the results of regression modeling, it seems necessary to pay proper attention to factors associated with MSDs to develop ergonomic solutions to reduce or eliminate musculoskeletal injuries."
4,The Relationship Between Musculoskeletal Pain and Picky Eating: The Role of Negative Self-Labeling.,"Picky eating appears to be associated with poor health outcomes and thus it might have a role in musculoskeletal pain in adults. However, this relationship has not been investigated yet. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the number of musculoskeletal pain regions was associated with picky eating, which was characterized by food intake balance of familiar products or self-identification.A total of 4660 adult subjects were enrolled in this study. Picky eating was assessed in two ways; a countable score and self-identification of picky eating. For the countable score, the number of food items, which the subjects usually did not consume among a list of 11 familiar products was measured. Self-identification as a picky eater was defined through a single question. The presence of musculoskeletal pain; in the neck, low back, knee, back, or arm, within 2??months of the survey was also identified.Of all subjects, 2654 (56%) had musculoskeletal pain in at least one region. The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in every region was seen as consistently higher in subjects who self-identified as picky eaters than those who were non-picky eaters. In multiple linear regression analysis, the number of pain regions was significantly associated with older age, females, self-identification as a picky eater, and low body weight, not but the countable score.There may be an association between musculoskeletal pain and negative beliefs about one's own eating behaviors."
4,Factors associated with health care seeking behavior for musculoskeletal pain in Indonesia: A cross-sectional study.,"To assess the factors defining healthcare-seeking behavior of people with musculoskeletal pain in the urban community of Malang City, East Java, Indonesia.A cross-sectional survey was performed in Malang City, East Java, Indonesia. In total, 2067 participants aged 16-93??years were interviewed. The sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors of healthcare seeking behavior, musculoskeletal pain, disability, and adverse drug reactions were assessed using the validated Indonesian version of Community Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Disease (COPCORD) protocol by International League of Associations for Rheumatology and the World Health Organization core questionnaire. Chi-square test was applied to assess the determinants of health-seeking behavior for musculoskeletal pain.Slightly more than one-third of the respondents (36%) with musculoskeletal pain, described as osteoarthritis, low back pain, gouty arthritis, soft tissue rheumatism, and autoimmune arthritis, were assessed for their health-seeking behavior. About 73% of all those participants sought treatment for their musculoskeletal symptoms. Treatment modality used was modern healthcare, traditional healthcare, self-treatment using traditional medication, self-treatment using modern medication with the proportions of 20.94%, 25.23%, 33.95%, 25.77%, respectively. Disability significantly affected health-seeking behavior as the major determinant (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.087, 95% CI 1.031-1.146, P??=??0.002), followed by age (PR 1.043, 95% CI 1.000-1.087, P??=??0.049). Healthcare-seeking behavior was associated with the presence of adverse drug reactions (P??<??0.001).Factors associated with musculoskeletal pain health-seeking behavior were disability and age. Self and traditional healthcare treatment were further associated with an adverse drug reaction."
4,Early musculoskeletal classroom education confers little advantage to medical student knowledge and competency in the absence of clinical experiences: a retrospective comparison study.,"Deficiencies in medical student knowledge in musculoskeletal medicine have been well documented. To address these deficiencies, numerous curricular changes at our institution were instituted. The objective of this study was to determine whether medical students in their preclinical years benefit from early exposure to musculoskeletal medicine when compared to students exposed to musculoskeletal medicine just prior to completion of their preclinical curriculum.United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and 2 scores were compared for periods of time before and after institution of the new curriculum. Scores on the previously validated 24-question short answer survey from Freedman and Bernstein were also compared over these same periods of time between these two groups and to established standards for competency, using a student's two-tailed unpaired t-test for significance. Entering Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores were used to compare baseline preparation of students.Overall USMLE scores as well as scores on the USMLE subtest on Musculoskeletal, Skin and Connective Tissue Disease showed no improvement when scores were compared between the two groups of students. There was a statistically significant lower performance on the Freedman and Bernstein knowledge assessment exam for students in the new pre-clinical curriculum as compared to those introduced under the old model, considering both musculoskeletal knowledge (p?€?<?€?0.001) and proficiency (p?€?<?€?0.01), though the response rate on the recent survey was low (112/986 or 11%). Spine remained the least understood sub-topic, while a dedicated course in rheumatology likely contributed to increased student knowledge in that area. Additional exposure to musculoskeletal topics during the clinical years increased student knowledge. There was no difference between groups when comparing entering MCAT scores.Classroom curricular changes, including moving the introductory musculoskeletal course to the first year, intended to optimize musculoskeletal medicine education in the pre-clinical years of medical school did not appear to improve student musculoskeletal knowledge at any year of training. Further efforts to improve the education of medical students in musculoskeletal medicine should be directed towards providing more clinical experiences with patients having musculoskeletal concerns. This was a retrospective comparative study, level III evidence."
4,Prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal conditions and associated factors in Brazilian adults - National Health Survey.,"Chronic non-communicable diseases entail high impact on health systems in Brazil and worldwide. Among the most frequent are the musculoskeletal conditions which comprise a group of diseases that influence individuals' physical status, quality of life and functional capacity. Epidemiological studies investigating the scale of such conditions in the adult population are scarce in Brazil. This study estimates the prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal conditions and their association with demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural and clinical factors.Cross-sectional study with data from Brazil's 2013 National Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Sa??de), a nationwide household survey of 60,202 adults. Musculoskeletal conditions were specified by self-reported medical diagnosis of arthritis or rheumatism and self-reported spinal disorders. The variables were examined using a hierarchical model of determination. Prevalences of musculoskeletal conditions were calculated with their respective 95% confidence intervals for Brazil and its five regions. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were obtained by Poisson regression with robust variance.Of the 60,202 individuals evaluated, 21.6% presented musculoskeletal conditions, with higher prevalences for females, older adults, indigenous, those living with a partner, low education, no occupational activity, those living in the South Region of Brazil, in rural areas, daily smokers, sedentary, obese, those who did not drink alcohol, with depressive symptoms or suffering from three or more chronic diseases. Multivariate analysis identified strong associations with advanced age (PR?€?=?€?3.61; 95% CI 3.27-3.98), depressive symptoms (PR?€?=?€?1.69; 95% CI 1.57-1.81) and multimorbidity (PR?€?=?€?1.94; 95% CI 1.77-2.12).The results show high prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions in Brazil's adult population. Considering the process of aging and steady growth in chronic diseases, this study underlines the need for health policies directed to prevention, treatment and rehabilitation for people affected by chronic musculoskeletal conditions."
4,Utility of point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasound in the evaluation of emergency department musculoskeletal pathology.,"To evaluate the utilization of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for the assessment of emergency department (ED) patients with musculoskeletal symptoms and the impact of musculoskeletal POCUS on medical decision-making and patient management in the ED.This was a retrospective review of ED patients presenting with musculoskeletal symptoms who received a POCUS over a 3.5-year period. An ED POCUS database was reviewed for musculoskeletal POCUS examinations used for medical decision-making. Electronic medical records were then reviewed for demographic characteristics, history, physical examination findings, ED course, additional imaging studies, and impact of musculoskeletal POCUS on patient management in ED.A total of 264 subjects (92 females, 172 males) and 292 musculoskeletal POCUS examinations were included in the final analysis. Most common symptomatic sites were knee (31.8%) and ankle (16.3%). Joint effusion was the most common finding on musculoskeletal POCUS, noted in 33.7% of the patients, and subcutaneous edema/cobblestoning was found in 10.2% of the patients. Muscle or tendon rupture was found in 2.3% of the patients, and 1.9% of the patients had joint dislocation. Bursitis or bursa fluid was found in 3.4% of patients, and tendonitis/tendinopathy was found in 2.3%. Twenty percent of them were ultrasound-guided musculoskeletal procedures, and most of them (73.3%) were arthrocentesis. Of the included studies, all except three either changed or helped guide patient management as documented in the patients' medical records.Our study findings illustrate the utility of POCUS in the evaluation of a variety of musculoskeletal pathologies in the ED."
4,Pelvic musculoskeletal dysfunctions in women with and without chronic pelvic pain.,"This study aimed to compare the prevalence of pelvic musculoskeletal dysfunctions in women with and without Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP).A total of 84 women with and without CPP (42 in each group), participated in this cross-sectional analytical study. After collecting demographic information, clinical examinations were carried out to compare pelvic musculoskeletal dysfunctions between two groups. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-fit, Independent t, X<sup>2</sup> and Pearson correlation tests were used for data analysis. Values of p??<??0.05 were considered statistically significant.Significant differences were found in the asymmetric iliac crest and pubic symphysis height (45.2% vs 9.5%), positive sacroiliac provocation and positive Carnett's tests (50% vs 4.8%), (p??<??0.05). CPP Patients exhibited more tenderness at Levator ani, Piriformis, and Obturator Internus muscles, also higher degrees of pelvic inclination (p??<??0.05).Higher frequency of pelvic musculoskeletal dysfunctions in women with CPP suggests the value of routine musculoskeletal examinations for earlier diagnosis of musculoskeletal originated CPP and effective management of these patients."
4,Musculoskeletal pain and musculoskeletal syndromes in adolescents are related to electronic devices.,"To evaluate television and simultaneous electronic devices use in adolescents with musculoskeletal pain and musculoskeletal pain syndromes.A cross-sectional study was performed in 299 healthy adolescents of a private school. All students completed a self-administered questionnaire, including: demographic data, physical activities, musculoskeletal pain symptoms, and use of simultaneous television/electronic devices (computer, internet, electronic games, and cell phones). Seven musculoskeletal pain syndromes were also evaluated: juvenile fibromyalgia, benign joint hypermobility syndrome, myofascial syndrome, tendinitis, bursitis, epicondylitis, and complex regional pain syndrome.Inter-rater agreement between pretest and retest was 0.83. Musculoskeletal pain and musculoskeletal pain syndrome were found in 183/299 (61%) and 60/183 (33%), respectively. The median age (15 [10-18] vs. 14 [10-18] years, p=0.032) and years of education (10 [5-12] vs. 9 [5-12] years, p=0.011) were significantly higher in adolescents with musculoskeletal pain when compared with those without this condition. The frequencies of female gender (59% vs. 47%, p=0.019), cell phone use (93% vs. 81%, p=0.003), and simultaneous use of at least two electronic devices (80% vs. 67%, p=0.011) were significantly higher in the former group. Further comparisons between adolescents with and without musculoskeletal pain syndromes revealed that the frequency of female gender was significantly higher in the former group (75% vs. 25%, p=0.002), and with a significantly reduced median of weekends/holidays electronic games use (1.5 [0-10] vs. 3 [0-17]h/day, p=0.006).A high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain/syndromes was observed in female adolescents. Musculoskeletal pain was mostly reported at a median age of 15 years, and students used at least two electronic devices. Reduced use of electronic games was associated with musculoskeletal pain syndromes."
4,Work-related musculoskeletal symptoms amongst Otolaryngologists and Head and Neck surgeons in Canada.,"The first objective of this study was to identify work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and determine their prevalence in the practice of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck surgery in Canada. The second objective was to establish potential associations between those musculoskeletal symptoms and variables related to demographic status of the surgeons, their workload and work ergonomics. This study was designed as a Canadian census on work-related musculoskeletal symptoms amongst Otolaryngologist and Head and Neck surgeons. The census was a self-administered electronic survey. It was distributed to all Otolaryngologists and Head and Neck surgeons members of either the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery or the Association of Oto-rhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery of Quebec. The questionnaire contained three sections: demographic and workload-related data, identification of work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and evaluation of working ergonomics. The response rate was 23%. Ninety seven percent (97%) of respondents experienced some physical symptom in one or many regions of their body. Seventy-four percents (74%) of respondents noted an exacerbation of their musculoskeletal symptoms by work. Musculoskeletal symptoms limited the daily activities of 45% of respondents while 23% think that their occupational longevity will be diminished by these limitations. The prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders is high among otolaryngologists and its impact on the surgeon's personal and professional life is high. There is a need to improve ergonomics in the clinical and operative room settings and to educate surgeons on ergonomic principles."
4,Association between positive and negative affect and musculoskeletal pain among US home health aides.,"As the US population ages, there is an expected increase in demand for home health aides (HHAs); therefore, it is important to ensure their occupational well-being. Previous studies have demonstrated associations between negative emotions and musculoskeletal pain. Using survey data collected from 285 HHAs, we characterize the association between affect and musculoskeletal pain. Affect was measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, while musculoskeletal pain was measured using the Brief Pain Inventory. We found that as positive affect composite score increased, musculoskeletal pain decreased [?? = -0.57, t(124) = -7.01, p < .001]. There was no significant association between the negative affect composite score and musculoskeletal pain. However, several individual moods were associated with decreased or increased pain. These data suggest that some moods may buffer against musculoskeletal pain, while others may predispose HHAs to musculoskeletal pain."
4,The IASP classification of chronic pain for ICD-11: chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain.,"Chronic musculoskeletal pain is defined as chronic pain arising from musculoskeletal structures such as bones or joints. Although comprising the most prevalent set of chronic pain conditions, it was not represented appropriately in the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which was organized mainly according to anatomical sites, was strongly focused on musculoskeletal disease or local damage, and did not consider the underlying mechanisms of pain. The new ICD-11 classification introduces the concept of chronic primary and secondary musculoskeletal pain, and integrates the biomedical axis with the psychological and social axes that comprise the complex experience of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain is a condition in its own right, not better accounted for by a specific classified disease. Chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain is a symptom that arises from an underlying disease classified elsewhere. Such secondary musculoskeletal pain originates in persistent nociception in musculoskeletal structures from local or systemic etiologies, or it may be related to deep somatic lesions. It can be caused by inflammation, by structural changes, or by biomechanical consequences of diseases of the nervous system. It is intended that this new classification will facilitate access to patient-centered multimodal pain management and promote research through more accurate epidemiological analyses."
4,"Comparing the Effectiveness of Three Ergonomic Risk Assessment Methods-RULA, LUBA, and NERPA-to Predict the Upper Extremity Musculoskeletal Disorders.","Musculoskeletal disorders are a major problem in all jobs. Several methods are available for assessing the exposure to risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders. This study is aimed at comparing three different ergonomic risk assessment methods-rapid upper limb assessment (RULA), loading on the upper body assessment (LUBA), and new ergonomic posture assessment (NERPA) method-to predict upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders.The study was conducted on 210 workers from three different industries including pharmaceutical, automotive, and assembly in the Isfahan province. A Nordic questionnaire was used for determining the levels of musculoskeletal disorders. Then, selected postures were evaluated with RULA, LUBA, and NERPA methods. Finally, data were analyzed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check the normality distribution of data, Spearman's correlation test to investigate the correlation between the assessed levels with musculoskeletal disorders, and Wilcoxon test to identify significant differences between the values with SPSS version 16.Wilcoxon test revealed a significant difference between the values related to NERPA and RULA (<i>P</i> < 0.001), whereas no significant relation between LUBA and RULA was shown by this test (<i>P</i> = 0.914). The correlation coefficients of the musculoskeletal disorders' level with RULA level, NERPA level, and LUBA level were 0.74, 0.73, and 0.69, respectively.Low-risk levels in NERPA, medium-risk levels in LUBA, and high-risk levels in RULA are evaluated better. The results showed that RULA was the best method for assessing musculoskeletal disorders among the three methods."
4,Higher Incidence of Sleep Disturbance among Survivors with Musculoskeletal Pain after the Great East Japan Earthquake: A Prospective Study.,"Sleep disturbance is a common symptom after natural disasters. Although musculoskeletal pain also increases after natural disasters, its relation to sleep disturbance is not clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of musculoskeletal pain on new-onset sleep disturbance among survivors after the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE). A prospective cohort study was conducted with the survivors of the GEJE at two and three years after the earthquake. New-onset sleep disturbance was defined as sleep disturbance absent at two years and present at three years after the earthquake. The sites of musculoskeletal pain included low back, shoulder, knee, and hand or foot. The number of musculoskeletal pain sites at two years after the earthquake was divided into three categories (0, 1, and 2 or more). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for new-onset sleep disturbance according to the number of musculoskeletal pain sites. A total of 1,102 survivors were included in this study and 14.6% of the participants reported new-onset sleep disturbance. Using ""0"" as a reference, the adjusted ORs (95% CI) for new-onset sleep disturbance were 2.43 (1.55-3.80) in ""1"" and 2.96 (1.88-4.64) in ""2 or more"", respectively (P for trends < 0.001). In conclusion, this is the first study showing higher incidence of sleep disturbance among survivors with musculoskeletal pain after the GEJE. Care for musculoskeletal pain is important to prevent sleep disturbance after natural disasters."
4,Dissatisfaction with work as a risk factor of musculoskeletal complaints among foresters in Poland.,"Researchers indicate an important relationship between the level of job satisfaction and the state of health of the employees. Some elements of work related with its character, organization, and interpersonal relationships may evoke strong stress, manifested by, among others, an increased musculoskeletal tension which, in turn, may lead to permanent dysfunction of this system.The objective of the study was analysis of the relationship between the level of job satisfaction and occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders among employees of the State Forests.The research material was collected using two instruments: the modified Nordic Questionnaire for assessment of musculoskeletal disorders, and a questionnaire concerning job satisfaction. The study was conducted in a group of 396 employees of the State Forests from 8 regions of Poland.The results of analysis confirmed a significant relationship between job satisfaction and the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders. The lower the level of job satisfaction, the more frequent the experiencing of musculoskeletal disorders.Low level of job satisfaction is a risk factor for the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders. Shaping of work conditions, which are the source of job satisfaction, should be considered as one of the main elements of prevention of musculoskeletal complaints."
4,Prevalence and pattern of co-occurring musculoskeletal pain and its association with back-related disability among people with persistent low back pain: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Individuals with persistent low back pain commonly have a broad range of other health concerns including co-occurring musculoskeletal pain, which significantly affect their quality of life, symptom severity, and treatment outcomes. The purpose of this review is to get a better understanding of prevalence and patterns of co-occurring musculoskeletal pain complaints in those with persistent low back pain and its potential association with age, sex, and back-related disability as it might affect prognosis and management.This systematic review protocol has been designed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols. We will perform a comprehensive search, with no date limit, in the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE and Embase (via Ovid), CINAHL, and Scopus for citation tracking, based on the following domains: back pain, co-occurring musculoskeletal pain, combined with a focus group that emphasizes study design. Appropriate papers will be screened against the eligibility criteria by three reviewers independently, data extracted by two independent author pairs and disagreement resolved by consensus meetings or other reviewers if required. Assessment of methodological quality and risk of bias will be conducted using a modified version of the Risk of Bias Tool for Prevalence Studies developed by Hoy and colleagues. The overall risk of bias will be determined for each included study based on the raters' consensus of the responses to the items in this tool. In case of sufficiently homogenous studies, meta-analysis will be performed.Given the lack of standard terms used to define co-occurring musculoskeletal pain, the search strategy will include the broader term ""back pain,"" different terms for the ""other co-occurring pain,"" and specific study designs combined with several exclusion terms. The results of this proposed review will identify the prevalence and patterns of co-occurring musculoskeletal pain among those with persistent low back pain, which is likely to inform clinical management, research, and policy in management of musculoskeletal disorders.PROSPERO CRD42017068807."
4,Cost-effectiveness of yoga for managing musculoskeletal conditions in the workplace.,"Back pain and musculoskeletal conditions negatively affect the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of employees and generate substantial costs to employers.To assess the cost-effectiveness of yoga for managing musculoskeletal conditions.A randomized controlled trial evaluated an 8-week yoga programme, with a 6-month follow-up, for National Health Service (NHS) employees. Effectiveness in managing musculoskeletal conditions was assessed using repeated-measures generalized linear modelling for the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) and the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool. Cost-effectiveness was determined using area-under-the-curve linear regression for assessing HRQL from healthcare and societal perspectives. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was also calculated. Sickness absence was measured using electronic staff records at 6 months.There were 151 participants. At 6 months, mean differences between groups favouring yoga were observed for RDQ [-0.63 (95% CI, -1.78, 0.48)], Keele STarT [-0.28 (95% CI, -0.97, 0.07)] and HRQL (0.016 QALY gain). From a healthcare perspective, yoga yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ??2103 per QALY. Given a willingness to pay for an additional QALY of ??20 000, the probability of yoga being cost-effective was 95%. From a societal perspective, yoga was the dominant treatment compared with usual care. At 6 months, electronic staff records showed that yoga participants missed a total of 2 working days due to musculoskeletal conditions compared with 43 days for usual care participants.Yoga for NHS employees may enhance HRQL, reduce disability associated with back pain, lower sickness absence due to musculoskeletal conditions and is likely to be cost-effective."
4,Predictors of healthcare seeking delays among children with chronic musculoskeletal disorders in Nepal.,"Healthcare seeking behaviors among children with musculoskeletal disorders are poorly understood. We sought to analyze healthcare seeking delays among children with chronic musculoskeletal conditions in Nepal and identify predictors of clinically significant delays.A cross-sectional study was conducted at a large pediatric musculoskeletal rehabilitation center in Nepal. Baseline sociodemographic data and healthcare seeking behaviors were assessed via interviews with 75 randomly selected caregivers. Delays of at least 3 months between disease recognition and presentation to a health worker were considered clinically significant. Predictors of significant delay were assessed via multivariable logistic regression.Clubfoot was the most common condition seen in the study sample (N?€?=?€?33; 37%). Mean and median presentation delays were 33 months and 14 months, respectively. Sixty-seven percent of children were delayed at least 3 months and 40% were delayed at least 2 years. Caregiver occupation in agriculture or unskilled labor was associated with an increased risk of delayed presentation (adjusted OR?€?=?€?4.05; 95% CI: 1.36-12.09).Children with chronic musculoskeletal disorders in Nepal face significant delays in accessing healthcare. This poses a major clinical problem as the delayed diagnosis and treatment of childhood musculoskeletal disorders can complicate management options and decrease long-term quality of life."
4,[Current prevalence and prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among physicians for internal medical examination in tertiary hospitals in a city of China].,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the current prevalence and prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among physicians for internal medical examination, and to provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of WMSDs in physicians for internal medical examination. <b>Methods:</b> In February 2017, 326 physicians for internal medical examination were randomly selected from 5 general tertiary hospitals and 2 specialized tertiary hospitals in a city of China. A questionnaire was designed according to the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and the occupational features of doctors in China to investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain over the past year, the cognitive attitude to WMSDs, the knowledge of WMSDs prevention, and ways to get the knowledge of WMSDs prevention. <b>Results:</b> In the tertiary hospitals of this city, the symptoms of WMSDs were mainly seen in the wrist (75.78%) , neck (67.19%) , and lower back (58.59%) among male physicians, and in the wrist (73.74%) , lower back (70.95%) , and upper back (60.89%) among female physicians. Compared with the female physicians, the male physicians had a significantly increased detection rate of symptoms of WMSDs in the neck (<i>P</i><0.05) and significantly reduced detection rates of symptoms of WMSDs in the upper and lower back (<i>P</i><0.05). There were significant differences between the detection rates of symptoms of WMSDs in the neck, wrist, and lower back within the past 12 months, 7 days, and >1 month (<i>P</i><0.01). The rates of knowledge of the severity and prevention of WMSDs were significantly different between the physicians with different working years and professional titles (<i>P</i><0.01) . <b>Conclusion:</b> Among the physicians for internal medical examination in the tertiary hospitals of this city, WMSDs are mostly seen in the wrist, neck, and waist, and the knowledge of WMSDs prevention varies with different working years and professional titles."
4,Cumulative IT Use Is Associated with Psychosocial Stress Factors and Musculoskeletal Symptoms.,"This study aimed to examine the relationship between cumulative use of electronic devices and musculoskeletal symptoms. Smartphones and tablet computers are very popular and people may own or operate several devices at the same time. High prevalence rates of musculoskeletal symptoms associated with intensive computer use have been reported. However, research focusing on mobile devices is only just emerging in recent years. In this study, 285 persons participated including 140 males and 145 females (age range 18-50). The survey consisted of self-reported estimation of daily information technology (IT) exposure hours, tasks performed, psychosocial stress factors and relationship to musculoskeletal discomfort in the past 12 months. Total IT exposure time was an average of 7.38 h (??5.2) per day. The psychosocial factor of ""working through pain"" showed the most significant association with odds ratio (OR) ranging from 1.078 (95% CI = 1.021-1.138) for elbow discomfort, to 1.111 (95% CI = 1.046-1.180) for shoulder discomfort. Desktop time was also significantly associated with wrist/hand discomfort (OR = 1.103). These findings indicate only a modest relationship but one that is statistically significant with accounting for confounders. It is anticipated that prevalence rates of musculoskeletal disorders would rise in the future with increasing contribution due to psychosocial stress factors."
4,A Mokken analysis of the literacy in musculoskeletal problems questionnaire.,"Limited health literacy is known to impact on medication adherence, hospital readmission and potentially poorer health outcomes. The literature on the health literacy of those with musculoskeletal conditions suggests greater functional limitations and increased pain levels. There are a number of measures of health literacy. One that specifically relates to musculoskeletal complaints is the Literacy in Musculoskeletal Problems (LiMP) questionnaire. The LiMP contains 9 multiple choice items that cover anatomy, musculoskeletal conditions and the diagnosis of musculoskeletal complaints. The aim of the study was to evaluate the dimensionality and internal structure of the LiMP in patients attending for osteopathy care at a student-led clinic, as a potential measure of musculoskeletal health literacy.Three hundred and sixty-one (n??=?€?361) new patients attending the Victoria University Osteopathy Clinic completed the LiMP and a demographic and health information questionnaire prior to their initial consultation. Mokken scale analysis, a nonparametric item response theory approach, was used to evaluate the dimensionality and structure of the LiMP in this population, to ascertain whether the questionnaire was measuring a single latent construct - musculoskeletal health literacy. McDonald's omega and Cronbach's alpha were calculated as the reliability estimations. The relationship between the LiMP and a single item screen of health literacy was also undertaken.The 9 items on the LiMP did not form a Mokken scale and the reliability estimations were below an acceptable level (alpha and omega <0.45). LiMP items 5 and 8 were more likely to be answered correctly by those with higher health literacy (p??<?€?0.05), however the effect sizes were small (<0.20).Calculation of a total score for the LiMP, as advocated by the original authors, is not supported based on data in the present study. Further research is required to explore the relationship of the LiMP items to demographic and clinical data, and to other broader measures of health literacy. Further research may also develop a health literacy measure that is specific to patients seeking manual therapy care for musculoskeletal complaints."
4,nmsBuilder: Freeware to create subject-specific musculoskeletal models for OpenSim.,"Musculoskeletal modeling and simulations of movement have been increasingly used in orthopedic and neurological scenarios, with increased attention to subject-specific applications. In general, musculoskeletal modeling applications have been facilitated by the development of dedicated software tools; however, subject-specific studies have been limited also by time-consuming modeling workflows and high skilled expertise required. In addition, no reference tools exist to standardize the process of musculoskeletal model creation and make it more efficient. Here we present a freely available software application, nmsBuilder 2.0, to create musculoskeletal models in the file format of OpenSim, a widely-used open-source platform for musculoskeletal modeling and simulation. nmsBuilder 2.0 is the result of a major refactoring of a previous implementation that moved a first step toward an efficient workflow for subject-specific model creation.nmsBuilder includes a graphical user interface that provides access to all functionalities, based on a framework for computer-aided medicine written in C++. The operations implemented can be used in a workflow to create OpenSim musculoskeletal models from 3D surfaces. A first step includes data processing to create supporting objects necessary to create models, e.g. surfaces, anatomical landmarks, reference systems; and a second step includes the creation of OpenSim objects, e.g. bodies, joints, muscles, and the corresponding model.We present a case study using nmsBuilder 2.0: the creation of an MRI-based musculoskeletal model of the lower limb. The model included four rigid bodies, five degrees of freedom and 43 musculotendon actuators, and was created from 3D surfaces of the segmented images of a healthy subject through the modeling workflow implemented in the software application.We have presented nmsBuilder 2.0 for the creation of musculoskeletal OpenSim models from image-based data, and made it freely available via nmsbuilder.org. This application provides an efficient workflow for model creation and helps standardize the process. We hope this would help promote personalized applications in musculoskeletal biomechanics, including larger sample size studies, and might also represent a basis for future developments for specific applications."
4,Association between sleep duration and musculoskeletal pain: The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2015.,"Both extremely long and short sleep durations have been associated with increased risk of numerous health problems. This study examined the association between self-reported sleep duration and reporting of musculoskeletal pain in the adult Korean population.This study included data from 17,108 adults aged ???50 years, obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012 and 2013-2015. Self-reported daily hours slept and the presence of musculoskeletal pain in knee joint, hip joint, or low back were examined. Patients were stratified into 5 groups by their sleep duration: ???5, 6, 7, 8, or ???9?€?h. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, adjusting for covariates including age, sex, marital status, smoking, alcohol use, family income level, education, physical exercise, body mass index (BMI), and stress level.A U-shaped relationship was observed between the length of sleep duration and the presence of musculoskeletal pain. After adjusting for covariates, sleep duration of ???5?€?h or ???9?€?h was significantly associated with musculoskeletal pain experienced for more than 30 days over a 3-month period. We also found that the presence of multi-site musculoskeletal pain was significantly higher among those who slept for ???5?€?h or ???9?€?h than in those who slept for 7?€?h.These findings suggest that either short or long sleep duration is associated with musculoskeletal pain among Korean adults."
4,"Relationships of Musculoskeletal Symptoms, Sociodemographics, and Body Mass Index With Leisure-Time Physical Activity Among Nurses.","Nurses have a high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms from patient handling tasks such as lifting, transferring, and repositioning. Comorbidities such as musculoskeletal symptoms may negatively affect engagement in leisure-time physical activity (LTPA). However, limited data are available on the relationship between musculoskeletal symptoms and LTPA among nurses. The purpose of this study was to describe musculoskeletal symptoms and LTPA, and to examine the relationships of musculoskeletal symptoms, sociodemographics, and body mass index with LTPA among nurses. Cross-sectional data on sociodemographics, employment characteristics, musculoskeletal symptoms, body mass index, and LTPA were collected from a statewide random sample of 454 California nurses from January to July 2013. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multiple logistic regressions were performed. We observed that non-White nurses were less likely to engage in regular aerobic physical activity than White nurses (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.40, 0.94]). Currently working nurses were less likely to engage in regular aerobic physical activity than their counterparts (OR = 0.48; 95% CI = [0.25, 0.91]). Nurses with higher body mass index were less likely to perform regular aerobic physical activity (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = [0.89, 0.97]) or muscle-strengthening physical activity (OR = 0.92; 95% CI = [0.88, 0.96]). This study found no evidence that musculoskeletal symptoms may interfere with regular engagement in LTPA. Physical activity promotion interventions should address employment-related barriers, and particularly target racial minority nurses and those who have a high body mass index."
4,The involvement of musculoskeletal system and its influence on postural stability in children and young adults with cystic fibrosis.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects the musculoskeletal system via a multifactorial pathway that includes vitamin D deficiency and involvement of respiratory muscles such as intercostals due to recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Eventual result is the deterioration of musculoskeletal health and posture in CF patients. Postural stability is directly affected by posture and can be compromised in every musculoskeletal problem. The aim of this study is to evaluate musculoskeletal system and postural stability in patients with CF.Patients with CF over six years of age and age and sex-matched control groups were included in the study. Cobb angle and thoracic kyphosis angles were measured on the spine radiographs. Both patients and control group were examined with pediatric gait, arms, legs and spine scale (pGALS). They also were evaluated with a NeuroCom Balance Master for their postural stability.Fifty-one patients with CF and 94 healthy controls participated in the study. In results of the pGALS examination, CF group had significantly more pathological findings than the control group in lower extremity appearance and movement (p?€?=?€?0.006 and p?€?=?€?0.01) and spine appearance and movement (p?€?=?€?0.001 and p?€?=?€?0.022) domains. The tandem walking speed was significantly higher in controls with a mean of 24.45?€????€?7.79 while it was 20.47?€????€?6.95 in the CF group (p?€?=?€?0.03). Various limits of stability parameters also showed significant differences. Medium correlations were found between musculoskeletal examination and postural stability parameters.In patients with CF, a systematic but simple musculoskeletal examination can detect pathologies, which are more frequent than the normal population. These pathologies show a medium correlation with the involvement of postural stability."
4,Prevalence of musculoskeletal diseases in a semi-urban Nigerian community: results of a cross-sectional survey using COPCORD methodology.,"The International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the Community Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic diseases (COPCORD) to promote the growth of rheumatology in developing countries. This is the first COPCORD-type survey carried out in a West African community. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal diseases in a semi-urban Nigerian community, using the COPCORD methodology. This is a cross-sectional total population survey, carried out in Katon Rikkos, Jos, Nigeria, from June 2015 to November 2016. All inhabitants of the community who are 15??years and older were included in the study, except those who were not available or refused to participate. Trained health workers from the community carried out a house-to-house survey, to administer the COPCORD questionnaire. People reporting musculoskeletal symptoms were examined and investigated at the teaching hospital, to determine the specific type of musculoskeletal diseases. Data was analyzed using Epi-info version 7.1.5 and P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The median age of the study population was 33 (IQR 24-46) years, with a male to female ratio of 1:1.1. The prevalence of musculoskeletal disease was 33%. Females (57.0%) were more affected than males (43.0%); the most common form of musculoskeletal diseases diagnosed was osteoarthritis (22.0%). Male sex and a family history of musculoskeletal diseases were independent predictors of musculoskeletal diseases. A Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) ???1 was recorded in 14% of subjects with musculoskeletal diseases. The prevalence of musculoskeletal diseases in this community is high with significant disability; therefore, there is urgent need for increased access to rheumatology care in the community."
4,Geographical variations in the use of diagnostic imaging of musculoskeletal diseases in Norway.,"There is a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in the Norwegian population. A significant number of these patients are referred to diagnostic imaging. Geographical variations in the use of imaging for musculoskeletal disorders may display over- or underuse, and knowledge about these variations is required.To investigate geographical variations in diagnostic imaging of the musculoskeletal system and analyze variations in the use of these examinations of all musculoskeletal diagnostic imaging, the specific modalities, and specific examinations.Population rates from Statistics Norway and outpatient radiological procedures of the musculoskeletal system registered at the Norwegian Health Economics Administration (HELFO) the first half of 2016 were accessed. The HELFO data were age-adjusted; high/low ratios were calculated as rates in number of examinations per 1000 inhabitants. A high/low ratio of 1?€?=?€?equal use, 1.5-1.9?€?=?€?moderate variation (approximately 50% difference), and?€?>?€?2 (twice as much)?€?=?€?high variation.Geographical variations were demonstrated at all levels, with an overall high/low ratio of 1.3. For specific modalities the highest variation was for ultrasound (3.2) and CT (2.2). For individual examinations, the highest high/low ratios were observed for MRI of the shoulder (2.4) and radiography of the lower back (1.9) and shoulder (1.8).We demonstrate a moderate to high geographical variation in the use of diagnostic imaging of the musculoskeletal system. This variation can indicate over- or underuse, which may violate basic principles of equity, priority, setting and appropriate care, and needs further attention."
4,The comparison of frequency of the upper limb musculoskeletal disorders among patients with diabetes type II with normal cases.,"Musculoskeletal disease, that is recognized in diabetes and diabetes mellitus (DM) has shown a higher prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal complications. This study aimed at assessing the frequency of upper limb musculoskeletal disorders among patients with diabetes type II with normal cases in Mashhad, Iran.A cross-section of 100 patients with upper limb musculoskeletal disorders were enrolled in this study. The patients were examined by a unique physician considering carpal tunnel syndrome disorder, trigger finger, adhesive capsulitis, and Dupuytren's contracture at Ghaem hospital, Mashhad, Iran in 2015. All collected data were recorded by using SPSS version 21 and were analyzed through independent-samples t-test for comparing changes, and Chi-square.In this study, the mean age was 51.7??8.7 years old. Gender frequency was 114 (57%) male, and 86 (43%) female. There was no significant difference between groups in cases of gender frequency and mean of age (p>0.05). In evaluation of association between the two groups, there was significant difference for adhesive capsulitis, (p=0.04). Chi-square test showed significant association for age and adhesive capsulitis between the two groups, (p=0.040); but no other diabetes-related disorders, (p<0.05).The results of this study showed that in patients with diabetes mellitus and musculoskeletal complications such as upper limb musculoskeletal abnormalities, it will lead to an increase in skeletal muscle effects in DM patients. It is recommended that musculoskeletal examination is done periodically in DM patients for identification of these disorders and necessary actions are carried out for prevention of the disorders as soon as possible."
4,Functional resonance magnetic imaging (fMRI) in adolescents with idiopathic musculoskeletal pain: a paradigm of experimental pain.,"Studies on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that adults with musculoskeletal pain syndromes tolerate smaller amount of pressure (pain) as well as differences in brain activation patterns in areas related to pain.The objective of this study was to evaluate, through fMRI, the brain activation in adolescents with idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMP) while performing an experimental paradigm of pain.The study included 10 consecutive adolescents with idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (average age 16.3??1.0) and 10 healthy adolescents age-matched. fMRI exams were performed in a 3??T scanner (Magnetom Trio, Siemens) using an event-related design paradigm. Pressure stimuli were performed in the nondominant hand thumb, divided into two stages, fixed pain and variable pain. The two local Research Ethics Committees (Ethics Committee from Universidade Federal de S??o Paulo- Brazil, process number 0688/11, on July 1st, 2011 and Ethics Committee from Hospital Israelita Albert Einsten - Brazil, process number 1673, on October 19th, 2011) approved the study.The idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMP) group showed a reduced threshold for pain (3.7??kg/cm<sup>2</sup> versus 4.45??kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, p?€?=?€?0.005). Control group presented increased bain activation when compared to IMP group in the following areas: thalamus (p?€?=?€?0.00001), precentral gyrus (p?€?=?€?0.0004) and middle frontal gyrus (p?€?=?€?0.03). In intragroup analysis, IMP group showed greater brain activation during the unpredictable stimuli of the variable pain stage, especially in the lingual gyrus (p?€?=?€?0.0001), frontal lobe (p?€?=?€?0.0001), temporal gyrus (p?€?=?€?0.0001) and precentral gyrus (p?€?=?€?0.03), when compared to predictable stimulus of fixed pain. The same intragroup analysis with the control group showed greater activation during the unpredictable stimuli in regions of the precentral gyrus (p?€?=?€?0.0001), subcallosal area (p?€?=?€?0.0001), right and left occipital fusiform gyrus (p?€?=?€?0.0001; (p?€?=?€?0.0007), middle gyrus (p?€?=?€?0.01) and precuneus p?€?=?€?(0.02).Adolescents with idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMP) tend to request higher brain function in cognitive-emotional areas when interpreting unpredictable sensory-perceptual situations. Therefore, it is assumed that this difference in pain processing in adolescents with IMP make the subjective experience of pain something more intense and unpleasant."
4,The role of psychosocial stress in the development of chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Psychosocial factors play an important role in chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders. Although psychosocial stress is likely to contribute to the development of chronic musculoskeletal pain, investigations are limited to work-related stress or examination of specific conditions such as upper limb pain. The purpose of this review is to assess the evidence for an aetiological role of psychological stress in chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders.A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted. Electronic databases will be searched using predefined search terms to identify relevant studies. Data will be extracted by two independent reviewers, and disagreement will be resolved by a third reviewer. Only prospective longitudinal studies that assess psychosocial stress at baseline will be included. The population of interest will be inception cohorts or cohorts of people who have not yet developed chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders. The primary outcome measure will be the onset of chronic musculoskeletal pain.To our knowledge, this review will be the first to systematically explore the available evidence on the aetiological role of psychosocial stress for the development of chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders. This review has the capacity to inform clinical practice on the importance of an early identification and, consequently, treatment of individuals who present with acute musculoskeletal disorders accompanied by a high level of stress.PROSPERO CRD42017059949."
4,Beyond the Joint: The Role of Central Nervous System Reorganizations in Chronic Musculoskeletal Disorders.,"To a large extent, management of musculoskeletal disorders has traditionally focused on structural dysfunctions found within the musculoskeletal system, mainly around the affected joint. While a structural-dysfunction approach may be effective for musculoskeletal conditions in some populations, especially in acute presentations, its effectiveness remains limited in patients with recurrent or chronic musculoskeletal pain. Numerous studies have shown that the human central nervous system can undergo plastic reorganizations following musculoskeletal disorders; however, they can be maladaptive and contribute to altered joint control and chronic pain. In this Viewpoint, the authors argue that to improve rehabilitation outcomes in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, a global view of the disorder that incorporates both central (neural) and peripheral (joint-level) changes is needed. The authors also discuss the challenge of evaluating and rehabilitating central changes and the need for large, high-level studies to evaluate approaches incorporating central and peripheral changes and emerging therapies. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2017;47(11):817-821. doi:10.2519/jospt.2017.0608."
4,Musculoskeletal anomalies in children with Down syndrome: an observational study.,"Musculoskeletal complications of Down syndrome (DS) are common but infrequently reported. The combination of ligamentous laxity and low muscle tone contributes to increased risk of a number of musculoskeletal disorders and a delay in acquisition of motor milestones. The primary aim of this study was to describe musculoskeletal anomalies reported in a national cohort of children with DS.This was an observational study. Children with DS, aged 0-21 years, were invited to attend a musculoskeletal assessment clinic conducted by a paediatric physician. Relevant musculoskeletal history and clinical findings were documented.Over an 18-month period, 503 children with DS were examined (56% male). The median age was 8.1 years (0.6-19.2). Pes planus was almost universal, occurring in 91% of the cohort. A range of other musculoskeletal anomalies were observed, with inflammatory arthritis (7%) and scoliosis (4.8%) occurring most frequently after pes planus. Delay in ambulation was common; the median age to walk was 28 months (12-84).Children with DS are at increased risk of a number of potentially debilitating musculoskeletal problems. These conditions can present in variable manners or be completely asymptomatic. Pes planus is common; therefore, early consideration of orthotics and lifelong appropriate supportive footwear should be considered. Delayed ambulation is frequently noted. A significant proportion of children with DS have arthritis; however, despite a high prevalence, it is often missed, leading to delayed diagnosis. An annual musculoskeletal assessment for all children with DS could potentially enable early detection of problems, allowing for timely multidisciplinary team intervention and better clinical outcomes."
4,"Prevalence and causes of musculoskeletal impairment in Fundong District, North-West Cameroon: results of a population-based survey.","Epidemiological data on musculoskeletal conditions such as degenerative joint diseases and bone fractures are lacking in low- and middle-income countries. This survey aimed to estimate the prevalence and causes of musculoskeletal impairment in Fundong Health District, North-West Cameroon.Fifty-one clusters of 80 people (all ages) were selected using probability proportionate to size sampling. Households within clusters were selected by compact segment sampling. Six screening questions were asked to identify participants likely to have a musculoskeletal impairment (MSI). Participants screening positive to any screening question underwent a standardised examination by a physiotherapist to assess presence, cause, diagnosis and severity of impairment.In total, 3567 of 4080 individuals enumerated for the survey were screened (87%). The all-age prevalence of MSI was 11.6% (95% CI: 10.1-13.3). Prevalence increased with age, from 2.9% in children to 41.2% in adults 50??years and above. The majority of MSI cases (70.4%) were classified as mild, 27.2% as moderate and 2.4% as severe. Acquired non-trauma comprised 67% of the diagnoses. The remainder included trauma (14%), neurological (11%), infection (5%) and congenital (3%). The most common individual diagnosis was degenerative joint disease (43%). Over one-third (38%) of individuals with MSI had never received medical care or rehabilitation for their condition.This survey contributes to the epidemiological data on MSI in low- and middle-income countries. Nearly half of adults aged over 50??years had an MSI. There is a need to address the treatment and rehabilitative service gap for people with MSI in Cameroon."
4,Ergonomic practices and musculoskeletal disorders among ophthalmologists in India: An online appraisal.,"Ergonomics in ophthalmology is neither taught during professional training nor does it readily receive consideration or priority in clinical practice. Owing to a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among ophthalmologists, ergonomic awareness, and practices are vital in averting this modern epidemic.To assess the ergonomic practices and prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal disorders among ophthalmologists in India.An online survey was conducted among ophthalmologists who were registered with the All India Ophthalmological Society of India using a pre-tested and validated questionnaire.The prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal disorder in the 377 participants was 75.3% (284; 95% confidence interval: 70.6-79.5). Low back pain (149, 52.9%) was the most commonly reported symptom. Musculoskeletal disorder-attributed productivity loss was reported by 58.45% (166) of the respondents. Musculoskeletal disorder was most frequently associated with less than 10?€?years of work experience (odds ratio: 1.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.1-1.3, p?€?=?€?0.01) and lack of good clinic (odds ratio: 1.7; 95% confidence interval: 1.1-2.7, p?€?=?€?0.03) and operation room ergonomic practices (odds ratio: 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.1-2.9, p?€?=?€?0.03). Only 27.9% (105) of the respondents had accessed information related to ergonomics in ophthalmic practice.The self-reported musculoskeletal disorder among ophthalmologists in India is quite high and significant enough to cause some degree of productivity loss. It is thus imperative to emphasize the implementation of good ergonomic practices, especially among relatively young ophthalmologists."
4,The role of ergonomic saddle seats and magnification loupes in the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders. A systematic review.,"Musculoskeletal disorders affect a high percentage of dentists, dental hygienists and therapists. Static and awkward working postures are considered as major risk factors. Proper seat selection and use of magnification loupes are promoted for their ergonomic benefits. The aim of this review was to evaluate the existing empirical evidence on the effect of the above interventions on (i) correction of poor posture and (ii) reduction in musculoskeletal pain.The review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017058580). The Medline via Ovid, CINHAL via EBSCO, Web of Science, OpenGrey and EThOS electronic databases were searched. Prospective experimental studies were considered for inclusion. The Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool (EPHPP) was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies.Eight studies were included in the review. Four investigated the effect of loupes on posture and musculoskeletal pain, 4 the effect of the saddle seats on posture and one of the latter explored the combined effect of magnification and use of saddle seats on posture.Based on a limited number of studies, the use of ergonomic saddle seats and dental loupes leads to improved working postures. The use of loupes appears to relieve shoulder, arm and hand pain. However, their effect on neck pain is scarce. None of the studies reported on the effect of the saddle seats on musculoskeletal pain. Future well-powered prospective longitudinal studies are deemed necessary to confirm the conclusions of this review."
4,Associations between community-based physiotherapy for musculoskeletal injury and health related quality of life (EQ-5D): a multi-centre retrospective analysis.,"Community-based musculoskeletal physiotherapy is used to improve function and health related quality of life (HRQoL). The purpose of this retrospective, multi-centre observational study was to determine the association between community-based physiotherapy management for musculoskeletal disorders and changes in HRQoL.Four thousand one hundred twelve patients' data were included in the study. Patients were included if they received a single period of treatment for a musculoskeletal injury or disorder. Patients were only included if they were being treated for a single morbidity. Patients received standard physiotherapy appropriate to their specific disorder, which could include health education/advice, exercise therapy, manual therapy, taping, soft tissue techniques, electrotherapy and/or acupuncture. Health related quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D index.EQ-5D improved by 0.203 across all patients (d??=??1.10). When grouped by anatomical site of symptom, the largest increases in EQ-5D was in foot pain (0.233; d??=??1.29) and lumbar pain (0.231; d??=??1.13). Improvements in EQ-5D greater than the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) were seen in 68.4% of all patients. The highest proportion of patients with positive responses to treatment were in ankle pain (74.2%) and thoracic pain (73.4%). The hand (40.5%), elbow (34.7%), and hip (33.9%) showed the greatest proportion of patients that did not respond to treatment.Community-based musculoskeletal physiotherapy is associated with improved health related quality of life. A randomised controlled trial is needed to determine any causal relationship between community-based physiotherapy and health related quality of life improvements."
4,Rapid degradation and non-selectivity of Dakin's solution prevents effectiveness in contaminated musculoskeletal wound models.,"Dakin's solution (buffered sodium hypochlorite) has been used as a topical adjunct for the treatment of invasive fungal infections in trauma patients. Prudent use of Dakin's solution (DS) for complex musculoskeletal wound management implies balancing antimicrobial efficacy and human tissue toxicity, but little empirical evidence exists to inform clinical practice. To identify potentially efficacious DS concentrations and application methods, we conducted two animal studies to evaluate the ability of DS to reduce bacterial burden in small and large animal models of contaminated musculoskeletal wounds.An established rat (Rattus norvegicus) contaminated femoral defect model was employed to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of DS as a topical adjunctive treatment for Staphylococcus aureus infection. A range of clinically-relevant DS concentrations (0.00025%-0.125%) were tested, both with and without periodic replenishment during treatment. Next, an established goat (Capra hircus) musculoskeletal wound model, consisting of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa contaminated proximal tibia cortical defect, muscle crush, and thermal injury, was utilized to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of dilute DS (0.0025% and 0.025%) as a surgical irrigant solution. In situ reactive chlorine concentrations were monitored throughout each treatment using an automated iodometric titration approach.In a rat wound model, DS treatment did not significantly reduce S. aureus bioburden after 14 days as compared to saline control. Two treatment groups (0.01% single application and 0.025% multiple application) exhibited significantly higher bacterial burden than control. In a goat musculoskeletal wound model, neither 0.0025% nor 0.025% DS significantly altered P. aeruginosa bioburden immediately following treatment or at 48?€?h post-treatment. Overall, DS applied to exposed soft tissue exhibited rapid degradation, e.g., 0.125% DS degraded 32% after 5?€?s progressing to 86% degradation after 15?€?min following single application.We did not observe evidence of a therapeutic benefit following Dakin's solution treatment for any tested concentration or application method in two contaminated musculoskeletal wound models. Despite confirmation of robust bactericidal activity in vitro, our findings suggest DS at current clinically-used concentrations does not kill tissue surface-attached bacteria, nor does it necessarily cause host tissue toxicity that exacerbates infection in the setting of complex musculoskeletal injury."
4,Wording wisely: Including prevalence data and evidence based clinical outcomes of spinal and musculoskeletal degeneration in radiology reports.,"Diseases due to spinal and musculoskeletal degeneration are a common cause of disability worldwide. In the past few years, there has been widespread increase in the use of imaging in these conditions. However, the years lived with a disability has not declined. There is a growing body of evidence that imaging in spinal and musculoskeletal conditions due to degeneration and ageing is unnecessary and contributes to increasing costs. More worrying is the evidence that imaging may also cause harm due to prevalent use of cortisone injections and surgical procedures that are justified on the basis of a radiology report. Prevalence studies and randomized controlled trials in the past decade have provided a better understanding of these diseases beyond the morphological findings described in a radiology report. A radiology report supplemented with information on normal age related appearances, natural progression, available evidence on treatment and subsequent health outcome may help the referrer and patient understand the relevance of imaging findings in a patient specific context. This may reduce unwanted procedures, unnecessary costs and patient harm. This article attempts to provide such information for the most common degenerative diseases of the spine and musculoskeletal system."
4,"Relationship between growth, maturation and musculoskeletal conditions in adolescents: a systematic review.","To determine whether there is a relationship between physical growth and development, as determined by markers of biological maturation, and musculoskeletal conditions in adolescents.Systematic review.Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) were searched up to 6 September 2017.Studies that evaluated the association between biological maturation or growth and musculoskeletal conditions in adolescents (chronological age 10-19 years).From 20?€?361 titles identified by the searches, 511 full-text articles were retrieved and assessed for eligibility; 56 studies, all at high risk of bias, evaluating the relationship between maturation and/or growth and musculoskeletal conditions were included. A total of 208 estimates of association were identified across the included studies, which generally indicated no association or an unclear association between maturation, growth and musculoskeletal conditions.While the relationship between maturation, growth and musculoskeletal conditions remains plausible, the available evidence is not supportive. The current body of knowledge is at high risk of bias, which impedes our ability to establish whether biological maturity and growth are independent risk factors for musculoskeletal conditions."
4,Concurrent musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain in the upper extremity can affect the treatment and prognosis of carpal tunnel syndrome: redefining a common condition.,"To demonstrate the importance of recognizing and separating nonmedian nerve-related symptoms from those related to median nerve compression at the carpal tunnel.The records of 80 patients, aged 31-82 years (39 males and 41 females), who had undergone median nerve decompression using open and endoscopic release surgery, were reviewed. Peripheral electrodiagnostic studies were performed in all patients prior to surgery. Those whose nonmedian nerve-related symptoms, also known as musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain and tenderness, persisted postoperatively, were referred to another electrodiagnostic study to reassess the median nerve function at the carpal tunnel. Peripheral electrodiagnostic studies were deemed unnecessary for patients with exclusively median nerve-related symptoms who improved dramatically following surgery. Included from the study were cases whose presenting symptoms were primarily referrable to median nerve dysfunction with or without associated musculoskeletal pain. Cases that were excluded were those whose symptoms were related to various primary conditions. Outcome of surgery was reviewed and correlated with symptoms related to median nerve compression and musculoskeletal irritation, and with electrodiagnostic abnormalities.Complete resolution of symptoms, following surgery, occurred in patients with clinical and electrophysiologic signs of median nerve compression but without significant symptoms of musculoskeletal irritation. Those with concurrent and prominent musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain had variable results, both favorable and unfavorable, including three who developed signs and symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome.The symptoms related to median nerve compression at the carpal tunnel and the symptoms related to musculoskeletal and soft tissue irritation are two different symptom complexes that have important diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. We would like to propose that ""true carpal tunnel syndrome"" symptoms, those that are exclusively median nerve related, should be considered a distinct entity. When musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain is more prominent and dominates the overall clinical presentation, the term ""mechanical stress syndrome"" is more appropriate."
4,Musculoskeletal injuries in gastrointestinal endoscopists: a systematic review.,"Gastrointestinal(GI) endoscopy forms a significant proportion of clinicians' workloads. However, little attention is given to the ergonomic aspects of endoscopy. This systematic review of musculoskeletal pain and/or injuries in GI endoscopists aims to better understand the types of occupational injuries resulting from endoscopic procedures and associated risk factors. Areas covered: Systematic literature search conducted for articles evaluating prevalence, risk factors and mechanism of musculoskeletal pain and/or injuries related to GI endoscopy. In 13 included studies, 39-89% of surveyed endoscopists reported pain and/or injuries related to endoscopy. Common areas of pain were the back(15-57%), neck(9-46%), shoulders(9-19%), elbows(8-15%) and hands/fingers(14-82%). Risk factors included procedure volume, time spent doing endoscopy, cumulative time in practice and endoscopist age. Experimental studies showed that forces and loads placed on endoscopists' bodies during procedures place them at risk of occupational injury. Areas of pain differed between novice and experienced endoscopists implying separate mechanisms of injury. Expert commentary: Comprehensive investigation into the prevalence, types, pathophysiology and methods to minimise endoscopy-related musculoskeletal injuries is vital to ensure the continued efficient provision of endoscopy services in the face of rising demands worldwide. A paradigm shift is required in endoscopic devices and techniques to improve safety and comfort."
4,Infant carrying methods: Correlates and associated musculoskeletal disorders among nursing mothers in Nigeria.,"Infant carrying is an integral part of the mothering occupation. Paucity of data exists on its correlates and associated musculoskeletal injuries. In this study, factors and musculoskeletal injuries associated with infant carrying were investigated in 227 nursing mothers, using a structured questionnaire. 77.1% utilised the back infant carrying methods (ICM). Maternal comfort was the major factor influencing participants' (37.4%) choices of ICMs. Infant's age (p?€?=?€?.000) and transportation means (p?€?=?€?.045) were significantly associated with ICMs. Low back pain (82.8%) and upper back pain (74.9%) were the most reported musculoskeletal discomforts associated with ICMs, especially among women who utilised back ICM. Back ICM is predominantly used by nursing mothers. Impact statement Infant carrying has been associated with increased energy cost and biomechanical changes. Currently, there is a paucity of data on infant carrying-related musculoskeletal injuries. In this study, investigating factors and musculoskeletal injuries associated with infant carrying, the results showed that back infant carrying method is predominantly used by nursing mothers. Age of the infant and mothers' means of transportation were determinant factors of infant carrying methods. Among the several reported infant carrying-related musculoskeletal disorders, low back and upper back pain were the most prevalent, especially among women who utilised the back infant carrying method. There is need for women's health specialists to introduce appropriate ergonomic training and interventions on infant carrying tasks in order to improve maternal musculoskeletal health during the childbearing years and beyond. Further experimental studies on the effects of various infant carrying methods on the musculoskeletal system are recommended."
4,Use of structured musculoskeletal examination routines in undergraduate medical education and postgraduate clinical practice - a UK survey.,"Structured examination routines have been developed as educational resources for musculoskeletal clinical skills teaching, including Gait-Arms-Legs-Spine (GALS), Regional Examination of the Musculoskeletal System (REMS) and paediatric GALS (pGALS). In this study, we aimed to assess the awareness and use of these examination routines in undergraduate medical teaching in UK medical schools and UK postgraduate clinical practice.Electronic questionnaires were distributed to adult and paediatric musculoskeletal teaching leads at UK medical schools and current UK doctors in training.Responses were received from 67 tutors representing teaching at 22/33 [67??%] of all UK medical schools, and 70 trainee doctors across a range of postgraduate training specialities. There was widespread adoption, at responding medical schools, of the adult examination routines within musculoskeletal teaching (GALS: 14/16 [88??%]; REMS: 12/16 [75??%]) and assessment (GALS: 13/16 [81??%]; REMS: 12/16 [75??%]). More trainees were aware of GALS (64/70 [91??%]) than REMS (14/67 [21??%]). Of the 39 trainees who used GALS in their clinical practice, 35/39 [90??%] reported that it had improved their confidence in musculoskeletal examination. Of the 17/22 responding medical schools that included paediatric musculoskeletal examination within their curricula, 15/17 [88??%] used the pGALS approach and this was included within student assessment at 4 medical schools.We demonstrate the widespread adoption of these examination routines in undergraduate education and significant uptake in postgraduate clinical practice. Further study is required to understand their impact upon clinical performance."
4,How is symptom flare defined in musculoskeletal conditions: A systematic review.,"To systematically review the definitions for ""flare"" in musculoskeletal conditions, the derivation processes, and validation of definitions for the 12 most burdensome musculoskeletal conditions.A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PsycInfo and Lilacs to identify studies that investigated derivation or validation of a flare definition, which we considered as a phrase or group of domains.Reports of derivation of flare definitions were identified for 9/12 musculoskeletal conditions. Validation of flare definitions was initiated for 4/12. For each condition, different derivation and validation methods have been used, with variable levels of consumer involvement, and in some cases different groups have worked on the process in parallel. Although some flare definitions began simply as ""symptom worsening"" or ""change in treatment"", most evolved into multidimensional definitions that include: pain, impact on function, joint symptoms, and emotional elements. Frequently initial attempts to create phrase to define the term flare evolved into consensus on the breadth of domains involved. Validation has compared flare definitions/domains against measures of disease activity, clinicians' diagnosis, response to drug therapy, or a combination.This review suggests that greater characterisation and definition of flares in musculoskeletal conditions are linked to the inclusion of multiple perspectives, multifaceted domains and compound comparators for their validation. Further work is required to optimise and test the derived definitions for most musculoskeletal conditions. As some elements are disease-specific, flare definitions cannot be extrapolated to other conditions. Research regarding flare in back pain (most burdensome disease) is limited."
4,"Associations of office workers' objectively assessed occupational sitting, standing and stepping time with musculoskeletal symptoms.","We examined the association of musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) with workplace sitting, standing and stepping time, as well as sitting and standing time accumulation (i.e. usual bout duration of these activities), measured objectively with the activPAL3 monitor. Using baseline data from the Stand Up Victoria trial (216 office workers, 14 workplaces), cross-sectional associations of occupational activities with self-reported MSS (low-back, upper and lower extremity symptoms in the last three months) were examined using probit regression, correcting for clustering and adjusting for confounders. Sitting bout duration was significantly (p??<??0.05) associated, non-linearly, with MSS, such that those in the middle tertile displayed the highest prevalence of upper extremity symptoms. Other associations were non-significant but sometimes involved large differences in symptom prevalence (e.g. 38%) by activity. Though causation is unclear, these non-linear associations suggest that sitting and its alternatives (i.e. standing and stepping) interact with MSS and this should be considered when designing safe work systems. Practitioner summary: We studied associations of objectively assessed occupational activities with musculoskeletal symptoms in office workers. Workers who accumulated longer sitting bouts reported fewer upper extremity symptoms. Total activity duration was not significantly associated with musculoskeletal symptoms. We underline the importance of considering total volumes and patterns of activity time in musculoskeletal research."
4,Chronic musculoskeletal pain in Japan (the final report of the 3-year longitudinal study): Association with a future decline in activities of daily living.,"Previous epidemiological surveys conducted in Japan highlighted problems with conventional approaches to treating chronic musculoskeletal pain. On the basis of prior studies, we initiated the ""longitudinal investigation of chronic musculoskeletal pain"" in 2010. In our first two reports, we revealed a high prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal pain, low satisfaction with treatment, and reduced quality of life. Those with severe and consistent low back pain had the highest risk of the persisting pain. The risk factors for developing chronic pain also included working in a professional, managerial, or clerical/specialist occupation, being female, having a body mass index ???25, currently using alcohol or cigarettes, and having completed an educational level of vocational school or higher. As the final step of the epidemiological survey, the present study examined the effect of chronic musculoskeletal pain on a future decline in activities of daily living (ADL).A questionnaire was sent to individuals who participated in the research project in 2010. Follow-up research examining loss of basic or instrumental ADL, or certification of long-term care requirements, was conducted in 2013 ( n = 4989 subjects).The 3-year follow-up data revealed that chronic musculoskeletal pain was associated with a decline in ADL, even after adjusting for covariables such as age, sex, and smoking (adjusted odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidential interval, 1.16-2.10).Chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with future declines in ADL; therefore, relief of the chronic musculoskeletal pain may be important to maintain an active elderly population."
4,Secondary prevention of chronic musculoskeletal pain: A systematic review of clinical trials.,"Chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders are highly prevalent and have high personal and societal cost. Hence, early detection and care of patients at risk of developing chronic pain is important. Risk factors are well known and screening tools exist, but much less is known about the care of at-risk patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of secondary prevention strategies for musculoskeletal pain.We performed a systematic review of clinical trials in which treatments were adjusted to the risk of chronicity in adults with acute or subacute musculoskeletal pain. Clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses published after January 1, 2000 were searched in PubMed and PEDro databases and in the reference list of relevant papers. The risk of bias was assessed by the PEDro score.We identified 4807 potentially eligible articles; 13, corresponding to 9 studies, met the inclusion criteria. Most studies investigated low back pain. The overall risk of bias was moderate, mainly because of the difficulty of blinding in physiotherapy studies. As compared with a ""one-size-fits-all"" treatment, stratified programmes showed significant improvements in several domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: body structures and functions (pain, mood), activities (functional capacity), participation (return to work, quality of life), as well as environmental factors (healthcare consumption). Effect sizes were moderate. Overall, simple educational messages seemed sufficient for low-risk patients. Medium- and high-risk patients benefited from a physical reactivation programme combined with education. In high-risk patients, an additional cognitive-behavioural intervention further improved the outcome.A stratified approach seems effective in reducing long-term disability in patients with musculoskeletal pain. However, more research is necessary to confirm these results."
4,Lower risk of musculoskeletal pain among patients with end-stage renal disease treated by hemodialysis: A frequency-matched retrospective cohort study.,"Musculoskeletal pain is experienced by 5%-14% of the general adult population, and it is highly common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, the purpose of the study was to decide the prevalent rate of musculoskeletal pain in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and to analyze this relationship between myalgia and ESRD using clinical features and determinants.A total of 93,013 patients who received ESRD diagnoses during 2000 and 2010 and were followed up until December 31, 2011, were identified from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000) of the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI); non-ESRD controls were also selected from the LHID2000.The results indicated that the risk of chronic musculoskeletal pain is significantly lower in the hemodialysis treated ESRD cohort (subhazard ratio?€?=?€?0.52, P?€?<?€?.0001), despite of sex, age, or comorbidities. Older patients were discovered to be at lower risk of chronic musculoskeletal pain (subhazard ratio?€?=?€?0.94, P?€?=?€?.0765), with those aged 40 to 64 years having the highest hazard ratios (subhazard ratio?€?=?€?1.21, P?€?<?€?.0001), and the prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal pain in women was higher than that in men (vs female sex; subhazard ratio?€?=?€?0.69, P?€?<?€?.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a higher cumulative incidence of myalgia development in the non-ESRD cohort compared with the ESRD cohort (log-rank test, P?€?<?€?.001).Clinicians should assess the risk of chronic musculoskeletal pain in such patients and provide appropriate and timely support of hemodialysis."
4,Alu hypermethylation and high oxidative stress in patients with musculoskeletal tumors.,"Alu is one of the non-autonomous element retrotransposons, constituting nearly 11% of the human DNA. Methylation changes of the Alu element can cause genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer development, ultimately leading to the development of cancer. Epigenetic factors may induce the aberrant methylation of Alu and also oxidative stress. However, current knowledge of Alu methylation and oxidative stress is limited. There are few studies that have evaluated Alu methylation and oxidative stress on musculoskeletal tumor progression. Therefore, the present study evaluated the status of Alu methylation in musculoskeletal (MS) tumor, adjacent tissues, and blood leukocytes from MS tumor subjects, as well as unaffected participants. Moreover, we also investigated the oxidative stress status in MS tumor subjects and the control participants and determined the correlation between Alu methylation in MS tumors and that in blood leukocytes.Musculoskeletal tumors from musculoskeletal tumor patients (<i>n</i> = 40) were compared to adjacent tissues (<i>n</i>??=??40). The blood leukocytes from musculoskeletal tumor patients were compared to the blood leukocytes from controls (<i>n</i>??=??107). Alu methylation status was analyzed using quantitative combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA). In addition, 8-hydroxy 2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) values were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Alu methylation values in MS tumors were statistically significantly higher than those in adjacent tissues (<i>P</i>??=??0.035). Similarly, Alu methylation statuses in the blood leukocytes of MS tumor subjects were statistically greater than those of control participants (<i>P</i>??<??0.001). Moreover, there was a positive association between Alu methylation levels in MS tumors and blood leukocytes (<i>r</i>??=??0.765, <i>P</i>??<??0.001). In addition, the highest tertile was significantly associated with the risk of MS tumors (OR = 14.17, 95% CI [5.08-39.51]; <i>P</i>??<??0.001). The 8-OHdG values in MS tumors were statistically higher than in adjacent tissues (<i>P</i>??<??0.001) and circulating 8-OHdG levels were substantially greater in MS tumor subjects than in the control participants (<i>P</i>??<??0.001).These findings suggest that Alu methylation in blood leukocytes and plasma 8-OHdG might represent non-invasive biomarkers to help diagnose MS tumors. Therefore, Alu hypermethylation and high oxidative stress might be involved in the pathogenesis of the musculoskeletal tumors."
4,Does a Classroom Standing Desk Intervention Modify Standing and Sitting Behaviour and Musculoskeletal Symptoms during School Time and Physical Activity during Waking Time?,"Children are increasingly spending more time sedentary at school and during leisure time. This study examined the effects of a standing desk intervention in a classroom on children's standing and sitting time at school, sedentary and physical activity levels throughout the day (waking hours), and musculoskeletal discomfort. A within-subjects crossover study design was used. Participants used either a standing desk or traditional seated desk for 21 days before swapping desks for another 21 days. Accelerometry and musculoskeletal discomfort data were collected during the last seven days of each 21-day period. Mixed models were used to analyse accelerometry data. Zero-inflated regression models and logistic regression models were used to analyse discomfort data. Forty-seven male students (aged 10???11 years) participated in the study. Standing time was 21 min/school day higher (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and sitting time was 24 min/school day lower (<i>p</i> = 0.003) when standing desks were used. No significant differences were found in sedentary and physical activity time during waking hours between the standing desk and seated desk conditions. Students were less likely to report musculoskeletal discomfort in the neck, shoulder, elbows and lower back when using standing desks (OR 0.52???0.74). Standing desks significantly increased classroom standing time and decreased musculoskeletal discomfort reports but had no overall effect on daily physical activity levels. Schools should consider moving towards classrooms enabling a variety of postures to potentially improve the long-term health of children."
4,Relationships between work-related factors and musculoskeletal health with current and future work ability among male workers.,"The purpose was to increase job-specific knowledge about individual and work-related factors and their relationship with current and future work ability (WA). We studied cross-sectional relationships between mental demands, physical exertion during work, grip strength, musculoskeletal pain in the upper extremities and WA and the relationships between these variables and WA 11 years later.We used a dataset of a prospective cohort study (1997-2008) among employees of an engineering plant (n?€?=?€?157). The cohort was surveyed by means of tests and written questions on work demands, musculoskeletal health, WA score (WAS; 0-10), and mental and physical WA. Spearman correlation coefficients and logistic regression analysis were used.Among manual workers, we found weak correlations between grip strength and current and future physical WA. We did not find predictors for future poor WA among the manual workers. Among the office workers, we found that musculoskeletal pain was moderately and negatively related to current WAS and physical WA. More handgrip strength related to better future WAS and physical WA. Musculoskeletal pain (OR 1.67 p?€?<?€?0.01) and lower handgrip strength (OR 0.91 p?€?<?€?0.05) predicted future poor WA among office workers.Our results showed cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between musculoskeletal health and work ability depending on occupation. However, the present implies that predicting work ability in the far future based on health surveillance data is rather difficult. Testing the musculoskeletal system (grip strength) and asking workers' about their musculoskeletal health seems relevant when monitoring work ability."
4,Relation Between Musculoskeletal Pain and Voice Self-Assessment in Tele-Operators.,"To investigate musculoskeletal pain, vocal fatigue, and voice-related quality of life of tele-operators and compare these aspects with nonvoice-related professionals; and verify if there is a relationship between musculoskeletal pain and vocal fatigue and voice-related quality of life (V-RQOL) of tele-operators and nonvoice-related professionals.Thirty-five tele-operators (SG) and 35 nonvoice-related professionals with no vocal complaints (control group) participated in the study. All of them answered investigating questionnaires of musculoskeletal pain, vocal fatigue index, and V-RQOL. The data were statistically analyzed in aim to compare the groups and the association between variables.Women from SG presented higher pain frequency in their upper back than women from control group (P?€?=?€?0.039). Different correlations were observed between musculoskeletal pain and vocal fatigue, just as between musculoskeletal pain and V-RQOLindex, for men and women in both groups. However, men presented a higher number or correlations between the protocols than women from both groups.Female tele-operators presented higher pain frequency on their upper back when compared to nonvoice-related professional women. Musculoskeletal pain has a negative impact on voice-related quality of life and on the increase of vocal fatigue during oral communication, regardless of the professional use of the voice."
4,Musculoskeletal Pain and Occupational Variables in Teachers With Voice Disorders and in Those With Healthy Voices-A Pilot Study.,"This study aimed to compare musculoskeletal pain perception in teachers with voice disorders and in those with healthy voices, and to investigate the relationship between musculoskeletal pain and occupational variables (ie, work journey per week and working period).Forty-three classroom teachers were divided into two groups: dysphonic group (DG), 32 classroom teachers with voice complaints and voice disorders; and non-DG, 11 classroom teachers without voice complaints and who are vocally healthy. The musculoskeletal pain investigation survey was used to investigate the frequency and intensity of the pain. Occupational variables, such as work journey per week and working period, were investigated by the Voice Production Condition-Teacher questionnaire. The statistical tests used were the Spearman correlation (P?€?????€?0.05) and the Mann-Whitney U test (P?€?????€?0.05).There was no difference between the frequency and the intensity of musculoskeletal pain regarding dysphonia. Work journey per week was positively related to the frequency and the intensity of laryngeal pain in the DG. The working period had a negative relationship to the frequency and the intensity of musculoskeletal pain in the submandibular region in the DG.Classroom teachers with voice disorders and those with healthy voices do not have differences regarding the frequency and the intensity of musculoskeletal pain. Besides dysphonia the pain is an important symptom to be considered in classroom teachers. The occupational variables contributed to the presence of musculoskeletal pain in the region near the larynx, which appears to be directly proportional to work journey per week and inversely proportional to the working period."
4,The Burden of High-Energy Musculoskeletal Trauma in High-Income Countries.,"Though declining in the recent decades, high-energy musculoskeletal trauma remains a major contributor to the burden of disease in high-income countries (HICs). However, due to limitations in the available body of the literature, evaluation of this burden is challenging. The purpose of this review is to assess: (1) the current epidemiologic data on the surgical burden of high-energy musculoskeletal trauma in HICs; (2) the current data on the economic impact of high-energy musculoskeletal trauma; and (3) potential strategies for addressing gaps in musculoskeletal trauma care for the future.In 2016, mortality from road traffic injuries (RTIs) between the ages of 15-49 was reported to be 9.5% (9.0-9.9) in high-income countries, accounting for approximately 255??million DALYs. While RTIs do not fully capture the extent of high-energy musculoskeletal trauma, as the most common mechanism, they serve as a useful indicator of the impact on the surgical and economic burden. In 2009, the global losses related to RTIs were estimated to be 518 billion USD, costing governments between 1 and 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP). In the last decade, both the total direct per-person healthcare cost and the incremental direct per-person costs for those with a musculoskeletal injury in the USA rose 75 and 58%, respectively.ADDRESSING THE GAPS: While its impact is large, research on musculoskeletal conditions, including high-energy trauma, is underfunded compared to other fields of medicine. An increased awareness among policy makers and healthcare professionals of the importance of care for the high-energy musculoskeletal trauma patient is critical. Full implementation of trauma systems is imperative, and metrics such as the ICD-DALY have the potential to allow for real-time evaluation of prevention and treatment programs aimed to reduce injury-related morbidity and mortality. The dearth in knowledge in optimal and cost-effective post-acute care for high-energy musculoskeletal trauma is a reason for concern, especially since almost half of the costs are attributed to this phase of care. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation teams as part of a musculoskeletal trauma system may be of interest to decrease further the long-term negative effects and the economic burden of high-energy musculoskeletal trauma."
4,[Musculoskeletal system functional disorders in pregnancy].,"To bring about a comprehensive summary of the occurrence principle and the clinical manifestations of the musculoskeletal system functional disorders, focusing on those occurring most frequently during pregnancy.Overview study.Department of Health Promotion, Faculty of Sport Studies, Masaryk University, Brno; Rehabilitation department Lipova-lazne; Department of Midwifery, Faculty of Health Sciences, Olomouc.Analysis of literary sources and database Medline (1998-2017).The lack of movement activities within the framework of sedentary lifestyle correlates with the musculoskeletal system disorders, which may influence both the adaptation mechanisms in general, and the bodys ability to adapt to the changes in pregnancy. High prevalence of the musculoskeletal system functional disorders in pregnancy may only represent a reflection of the state of female musculoskeletal system at present, and pregnancy, being the period of increased burden placed on the musculoskeletal system, only reflects its dysfunction. Physiotherapy shows a way to resolve the musculoskeletal system functional disorders during pregnancy."
4,Effects of musculoskeletal system problems on quality of life and depression in students preparing for university entrance exam.,"This study was planned to investigate the relationship between musculoskeletal problems, depression, and quality of life in students preparing for university entrance exams.A total of 180 students were included in the study, 104 were female (57.77%), and 76 were male (42.22%). Students were reached through the cram schools (""dershane"") in Denizli. Musculoskeletal system problems, depression status, and quality of life were determined with the Musculoskeletal-Postural Discomfort Scale (MDS), Boratav Depression Screen Scale (Bordepta), and Short Form-36 (SF-36), respectively. Demographic data, daily study, and sleep duration were also recorded.Students have moderate musculoskeletal discomfort. Musculoskeletal disorders and depressive symptoms are more observed in female students than male students (<i>P</i> = 0.000). The SF-36 results were significantly negatively correlated with the MDS and Bordepta scores. A significant positive correlation was found between musculoskeletal disorders and depression status (r = 0.351, <i>P</i> = 0.000). Sleep duration was negatively correlated with the MDS and Bordepta (r = -0.209, <i>P</i> = 0.005; r = -0.148, <i>P</i> = 0.047, respectively) and positively correlated with the SF-36 role limitation/emotional and social functioning subscales (r = 0.225, <i>P</i> = 0.002 and r = 0.191, <i>P</i> = 0.010 respectively).Musculoskeletal problems and depression status negatively affects general health status especially in female students who are preparing for university entrance examinations. Students should be informed about musculoskeletal problems by healthcare professionals and the study room, tables, and chairs should be arranged ergonomically. Further studies might be determined that why musculoskeletal disorders and depression status are more widely among female students."
4,The association between body fat and musculoskeletal pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Obesity and musculoskeletal pain are strongly related, but there is emerging evidence that body fat, not body weight, may be a better indicator of risk. There is, therefore, a need to determine if body fat is associated with musculoskeletal pain as it may improve management strategies. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the association between body fat and musculoskeletal pain.Seven electronic databases were searched from inception to 8th January 2018. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating the association between measures of body fat and musculoskeletal pain were included. All included articles were assessed for methodological rigour using the Epidemiology Appraisal Instrument. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and effect estimates were pooled for meta-analysis.A total of 10,221 citations were identified through the database searching, which after abstract and full-text review, yielded 28 unique articles. Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analyses, which found significant cross-sectional associations between total body fat mass and widespread pain (SMD 0.49, 95% CI 0.37-0.61, p?€?<?€?0.001). Individuals with low-back pain and knee pain had a higher body fat percentage than asymptomatic controls (SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.17-0.52, p?€?<?€?0.001 and SMD 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.32, p?€?=?€?0.009, respectively). Fat mass index was significantly, albeit weakly, associated with foot pain (SMD 0.05, 95% CI 0.03-0.06, p?€?<?€?0.001). Longitudinal studies (n?€?=?€?8) were unsuitable for meta-analysis, but were largely indicative of elevated body fat increasing the risk of incident and worsening joint pain. There was conflicting evidence for an association between body fat percentage and incident low-back pain (3 studies, follow-up 4-20??years). Increasing knee pain (1 study) and incident foot pain (2 studies) were positively associated with body fat percentage and fat mass index. The percentage of items in the EAI graded as 'yes' for each study ranged from 23 to 85%, indicating variable methodological quality of the included studies.This systematic review and meta-analysis identified positive cross-sectional associations between increased body fat and widespread and single-site joint pain in the low-back, knee and foot. Longitudinal studies suggest elevated body fat may infer increased risk of incident and worsening joint pain, although further high-quality studies are required."
4,Musculoskeletal senescence: a moving target ready to be eliminated.,"Aging is the prime risk factor for the broad-based development of diseases. Frailty is a phenotypical hallmark of aging and is often used to assess whether the predicted benefits of a therapy outweigh the risks for older patients. Senescent cells form as a consequence of unresolved molecular damage and persistently secrete molecules that can impair tissue function. Recent evidence shows senescent cells can chronically interfere with stem cell function and drive aging of the musculoskeletal system. In addition, targeted apoptosis of senescent cells can restore tissue homeostasis in aged animals. Thus, targeting cellular senescence provides new therapeutic opportunities for the intervention of frailty-associated pathologies and could have pleiotropic health benefits."
4,"Sickness Absence due to Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain: The Exploration of a Predictive Psychological Model Including Negative Moods, Subjective Health and Work Efficacy in an Adult County Population (The HUNT Study).","The relation between musculoskeletal pain and sickness absence was tested in an adult county population. Maximal explained variance in absence from work due to chronic musculoskeletal pain (sickness absence) was tested in a model in which subjective health was expected to mediate the associations between such pain and dysphoria, respectively, and work efficacy. In turn, work efficacy was expected to mediate the link between subjective health and sickness absence. All the residents in the County of Nord-Tr??ndelag, Norway, aged 20 and older, were invited to take part in a public health survey during 1995-97 (HUNT-2), and 66,140 (71.2%) participated. Prevalence of musculoskeletal pain, dysphoria, subjective health and work efficacy were assessed, as well as sickness absence last year due to musculoskeletal pain. The model test was performed by use of the LISREL procedure based upon data from 30,158 employees reporting chronic musculoskeletal pain last year. The measurement model fitted the data well: ??<sup>2</sup> = 9075, df = 52, p < .0004, Critical N = 1041, RMSEA = 0.038, CFI = 0.99, SRMR = 0.020. The structural model fitted the data equally well, and the best prediction of sickness absence was obtained with lower back pain, upper and lower extremity pain, as well as dysphoria as the primary variables affecting subjective health that, in turn, was the convergent predictor of work efficacy that, finally, best explained the variance in sickness absence (56%). The data supported an indirect sequence of complaint-health-efficacy (CHE-model) as the best predictor of sickness absence due to musculoskeletal pain."
4,"Awareness of ergonomics & work-related musculoskeletal disorders among dental professionals and students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","[Purpose] The present research was undertaken to investigate the awareness of ergonomics and prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among dental professionals and students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and to find a mean to decrease the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in the future. [Subjects and Methods] A self-administered survey was prepared and disseminated to dental professionals and students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire was focused on the awareness of ergonomics and musculoskeletal disorders. Five hundred and sixty-one participants were included in this survey. [Results] Within the present study, significant differences were noticed among specialists, general practitioners and undergraduate students. Work load (risk factors) had great influence on musculoskeletal disorders in all dental practitioners, and lower back pain was the most common reported disorder among all practitioners. [Conclusion] Most of the respondent dentists seem to work in conditions that aggravate disorders of the musculoskeletal system, the increased prophylactic remedies were directly associated with the increase of the musculoskeletal disorders symptoms. All dentists regardless of their dental specialties, are recommended to apply principles of ergonomics in their daily practice. Moreover, dental ergonomics should be taught to undergraduate students and strictly implemented in the clinics to provide comfortable working environment for all dental professionals."
4,Musculoskeletal Pain is Associated With New-Onset Psychological Distress in Survivors of the Great East Japan Earthquake.,"Psychological distress is a common symptom after natural disasters. Although musculoskeletal pain also increases after natural disasters, its relation to psychological distress is not known. This study aimed to examine the association of musculoskeletal pain with new-onset psychological distress among survivors of the Great East Japan Earthquake.A panel study was conducted with survivors at 2 and 3 years after the Great East Japan Earthquake. New-onset psychological distress was defined as psychological distress absent at 2 years and present at 3 years after the disaster. The number of musculoskeletal pain sites at 2 years after the disaster was divided into 3 categories (0, 1, and ???2). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for new-onset psychological distress according to the number of musculoskeletal pain sites.The rate of new-onset psychological distress was 6.7%. Musculoskeletal pain was associated with new-onset psychological distress. Using ""0"" as a reference, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.65 (0.92-2.95) in ""1"" and 2.12 (1.24-3.64) in ""???2"" (P for trend=.02).Musculoskeletal pain is associated with new-onset psychological distress among survivors of the Great East Japan Earthquake.

4,Symptoms and musculoskeletal diseases in hospital nurses and in a group of university employees: a cross-sectional study.,"Most studies have shown that nurses have a higher risk of developing musculoskeletal symptoms compared with other occupational groups.A cross-sectional study was performed to gain more insight into the prevalence rates of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in nurses.The presence of musculoskeletal symptoms was revealed by personal interviews in a sample of 177 hospital nurses and in a reference group of 185 university employees. Musculoskeletal diseases were based on radiological examinations in all subjects.Lower back pain (61% vs 42.2%) was the most frequently reported symptom, followed by neck pain (48.6% vs 38.4%) and shoulder pain (36.7% vs 25.9%), with a significantly higher prevalence in nurses. Women had about a 2-fold risk of upper limb region and neck pain compared with men. The most common abnormal findings on radiological examinations were disc herniations (n?€?=?€?40).Nurses showed a significantly higher risk of MSDs. Prevalence rates in nurses increased significantly with age. Musculoskeletal symptoms were also common in university employees. This suggests the need for effective intervention strategies involving workers' active participation, in order to improve the process and organization of work and promote a positive psychosocial work environment."
4,"Child and adolescent musculoskeletal pain (CAM-Pain) feasibility study: testing a method of identifying, recruiting and collecting data from children and adolescents who consult about a musculoskeletal condition in UK general practice.","Test a method of identifying, recruiting and collecting data from children and adolescents who consult their general practitioner about a musculoskeletal condition.Prospective cohort feasibility study.13 general practices in West Midlands of England.Patients aged 8-19 years who consult their general practice about a musculoskeletal condition. Patients were identified via a relevant musculoskeletal Read code entered at the point of consultation.Feasibility was assessed in terms of <i>study processes</i> (recruitment rates), <i>data collection procedures</i> (duration, response variability), <i>resource utilisation</i> (mail-outs) and <i>ethical considerations</i> (acceptability).From October 2016 to February 2017, an eligible musculoskeletal Read code was entered on 343 occasions, 202 patients were excluded (declined, n=153; screened not suitable, n=49) at the point of consultation. The remaining 141 patients were mailed an invitation to participate (41.1%); 46 patients responded to the invitation (response rate: 32.6%), of which 27 patients consented (consent rate: 19.1%). Participants mean age was 13.7 years (SD 2.7) and current pain intensity was 2.8 (SD 2.7). All participants completed the 6-week follow-up questionnaire. All participants found the interview questions to be acceptable and would consider participating in a similar study in the future. The majority of general practitioners/nurse practitioners, and all of the research nurses reported to be adequately informed about the study and found the study processes acceptable.The expected number of participants were identified and invited, but consent rate was low (<20%) indicating that this method is not feasible (eg, for use in a large prospective study). Recruiting children and adolescents with musculoskeletal conditions in a primary care setting currently presents a challenge for researchers. Further work is needed to identify alternative ways to conduct studies in this population in order to address the current knowledge gap in this field."
4,Use of videoconferencing for physical therapy in people with musculoskeletal conditions: A systematic review.,"Background Physical therapists are key players in the management of musculoskeletal conditions, which are common in rural and remote communities. There are few physical therapists in rural regions compared to potential need, so care is either not provided or must be sought in urban centers, requiring travel and time away from work and family to access services. Telerehabilitation strategies, such as real-time videoconferencing, are emerging as possible solutions to address shortages in rural physical therapy services. Objectives This review will: (1) determine the validity and the reliability of secure videoconferencing for physical therapy management of musculoskeletal conditions; (2) determine the health, system, and process outcomes when using secure videoconferencing for physical therapy management of musculoskeletal conditions. Methods A protocol-driven systematic review of four databases was carried out by two independent reviewers. Study criteria included English language articles from January 2003 to December 2016, on physical therapy management using secure videoconferencing, pertaining to adults 18-80 years with chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Randomized controlled trials, pre-experimental studies, and case-control studies were included. Quality analysis was performed utilizing standardized tools specific for the study designs. Results and conclusions Validity and reliability studies were identified as having high risk of bias. Intervention studies were of moderate quality, and found positive impact on health outcomes and satisfaction. Two studies evaluated costs, with evidence of cost savings in one study. More robust research is required to evaluate long-term effects of telerehabilitation for physical therapy management of musculoskeletal disorders, including cost-benefit analyses."
4,"Work related musculoskeletal disorders among adolescent girls and young women employees of textile industries in Tamil Nadu, India - a comparative study.","Musculoskeletal disorders are common in those employed in the textile industry. The aim of the study is to assess musculoskeletal disorders among adolescent girls who are current employees of textile industries in comparison with the adolescent girls and young women who are past employees of textile industries and adolescent girls who have never been employed in the textile industry. Methodology This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 321 subjects, 107 in each study group were sampled. Standardized nordic questionnaires (SNQ) was used to assess musculoskeletal symptoms. Results More than half of the current employees (67.28%) and past employees (67.28%) reported musculoskeletal pain. Among the never been employed, 18.69% reported musculoskeletal pain. Neck and shoulder were the most common sites of musculoskeletal pain among the current employees (49.5% and 50.5%, respectively) and the past employees (45.8% and 49.5%, respectively). In the regression model, having ever been diagnosed for anemia (AOR 6.57, 95% CI 1.4 to 30.76), working for more than 48 h in a week (AOR 3.37, 95% CI 1.53 to 7.41) and the presence of depression (AOR 6.6, 95% CI 1.48 to 29.36) were significantly associated with the presence of musculoskeletal pain in the study participants. Conclusion Musculoskeletal disorders are a major occupational health problem among the adolescent and young women employees of textile industries. Working hours should be fixed at 48 h per week and anemia and depression should be treated to avert the work related musculoskeletal disorders in the study population."
4,"Relationship between Body Mass Index, Cardiorespiratory and Musculoskeletal Fitness among South African Adolescent Girls.","<i>Background</i>: Cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness are important health indicators that support optimal physical functioning. Understanding the relationship between body mass index and these health markers may contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions to address obesity-related complications. The relationship between body mass index, cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness has not been well explored, particularly in female adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between body mass index, cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness among South African adolescent girls in low-income communities. <i>Methods</i>: This cross-sectional study included 151 adolescent girls, aged 13???16 years. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using the 20 m shuttle run test and musculoskeletal fitness was assessed using a variety of field-based tests. Height and weight were measured with standardised procedures and body mass index (BMI) was derived by the formula [BMI = weight (kg)/height (m)??]. Participants were categorised into three BMI groups using the International Obesity Task Force age- and gender-specific cut-off points. Pearson correlations were used to determine the association between body mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness and measures of musculoskeletal fitness at <i>p</i> ??? 0.05. <i>Results</i>: Overweight and obese girls were found to have lower cardiorespiratory fitness, decreased lower extremity muscular strength, greater grip strength, and more hypermobile joints compared to normal-weight peers. BMI was negatively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and lower extremity muscular strength. <i>Conclusions</i>: The findings indicate that increased body mass correlates with decreased cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness. Interventions should be developed to target these important components of physical fitness in this demographic group."
4,Statins and Musculoskeletal Conditions in U.S. Air Force Active Duty Aviators.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the association of statin use and musculoskeletal conditions within the population of U.S. Air Force active duty aviators.The study was a retrospective cohort analysis of aviators between 2004-2014 as identified from personnel data. Based on pharmacy data, participants were divided into two groups: statin users (received a statin for at least 90 d) and nonusers (never received a statin throughout the study period). Using participants' baseline characteristics, a propensity score was generated and used to match statin users to nonusers in a 1:6 ratio. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratio for a musculoskeletal condition.A total of 19,330 participants met study criteria (131 statin users and 19,199 nonusers). Of these, 112 statin users were matched to 672 nonusers. Among matched pairs, statin users were not at significantly increased risk (odds ratio: 1.239; 95% confidence interval: 0.768, 1.999) for musculoskeletal conditions. Likewise, there was no observed significant association between specific musculoskeletal disease diagnosis groups and statin use.In this aviator population, there was not an increased overall likelihood of musculoskeletal conditions for statin users relative to propensity score-matched nonusers. A well-designed prospective cohort analysis or clinical trial is needed to ascertain possible adverse effects of statins on performance in the aviation environment.Tvaryanas AP, Wagner JH, Maupin GM.

4,Musculoskeletal Pain and Voice-related Quality of Life in Dysphonic and Non-dysphonic Subjects.,"This study aimed to compare and correlate musculoskeletal pain and voice-related quality of life of dysphonic and non-dysphonic individuals.This is a retrospective case-control study. A total of 74 adults were divided into two groups: the experimental group (EG) comprising 37 individuals with vocal complaints and hyperfunctional dysphonia, and the control group (CG) comprising 37 individuals without vocal complaints and with healthy voices. Both groups presented similar gender and age (28 females and 9 males for each group; average age?€?=?€?31.5). All the participants answered the protocols: Voice-Related Quality of Life and Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire. Statistical data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test (P?€?????€?0.05) and Spearman correlation test (P?€?????€?0.05).It was observed that the EG presented significantly lower scores of voice-related quality of life in the social-emotional (P?€?<?€?0.001), physical (P?€?<?€?0.001), and total (P?€?<?€?0.001) fields. Concerning musculoskeletal pain, it was observed in the EG that there was a higher intensity in pain in the region of the larynx (P?€?<?€?0.001), and a higher frequency of pain in the submandibular (P?€?=?€?0.013), larynx (P?€?<?€?0.001), and front of the neck (P?€?=?€?0.002) regions, when compared with the CG.In the group of individuals studied, worst indexes of voice-related quality of life and higher frequency and intensity of pain in the larynx were observed, in addition to higher frequency of pain in regions near the larynx in dysphonic subjects. There was correlation between voice-related quality of life and the frequency and intensity of musculoskeletal pain."
4,Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders and Risk Factors among Chinese Medical Staff of Obstetrics and Gynecology.,"Medical staff in the department of obstetrics and gynecology are a group of professionals reportedly at high risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD), however, little is known about the current status of this problem in China. The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence and risk factors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among this population in China. A self-developed questionnaire was distributed to 1017 obstetrics and gynecology practitioners to collect information on musculoskeletal symptoms and relevant factors. Prevalence and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in different parts of the body were calculated and the relationship between personal and ergonomic factors and work-related musculoskeletal disorders was analyzed using Chi-square test and unconditional logistic regression models. The results indicated a high prevalence of 85.5% among the subjects, with the shoulder (<i>n</i> = 575, 62.0%), neck (<i>n</i> = 560, 60.3%) and lower back (<i>n</i> = 504, 54.3%) being the three most affected regions. Individual, postural, work-environmental as well as psychosocial factors were recognized to be associated with WMSDs in different body parts. Therefore, attention must be given to the problem of musculoskeletal disorders among Chinese obstetrics and gynecology staff. It is recommended to develop good life habits, improve work environment, adjust work organization as well as train on proper postures in their daily operation."
4,"Generalised joint hypermobility and shoulder joint hypermobility, - risk of upper body musculoskeletal symptoms and reduced quality of life in the general population.","Generalised Joint Hypermobility (GJH) is a hereditary condition with an ability to exceed the joints beyond the normal range. The prevalence of GJH in the adult population and its impact on upper body musculoskeletal health and quality of life has mostly been studied in selected populations. The aims of this study were therefore, firstly to study the prevalence of GJH and GJH including shoulder hypermobility (GJHS), in the general Danish adult population; secondly to test the associations between GJH or GJHS and upper body musculoskeletal symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).The study was cross-sectional where 2072 participants, aged 25-65, randomly extracted from the Danish Civil Registration System), were invited to answer a questionnaire battery (Five-Part Questionnaire for classification of GJH, Standardised Nordic Questionnaire for musculoskeletal symptoms, EuroQoL-5D for HRQoL).Totally 1006 (49%) participants responded. The prevalence of GJH and GJHS were 30% (n?€?=?€?300) and 5% (n?€?=?€?51), respectively. Compared with Non GJH (NGJH), participants with GJH and GJHS had Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.5-3.5 for upper body musculoskeletal symptoms within the last 12??months (mostly shoulders and hands/wrists). GJH and GJHS also had OR 1.6-4.4 for being prevented from usual activities, mostly due to shoulder and neck symptoms. Furthermore, GJH and GJHS had OR 2.2-3.1 for upper body musculoskeletal symptoms lasting for more than 90??days (neck, shoulders, hand/wrists), and 1.5-3.5 for reduced HRQoL (all dimensions, but anxiety/depression) compared with NGJH. Generally, most OR for GJHS were about twice as high as for those having GJH alone.GJH and GJHS are frequently self-reported musculoskeletal conditions in the Danish adult population. Compared with NGJH, GJH and especially GJHS, present with higher OR for upper body musculoskeletal symptoms, more severe symptoms and decreased HRQoL."
4,Real time non-instrumented clinical gait analysis as part of a clinical musculoskeletal assessment in the treatment of lower limb symptoms in adults: A systematic review.,"The aim of this review was to evaluate and summarise the current evidence on non-computerised or non-recorded real time adult gait assessment conducted within the clinical musculoskeletal setting. It was hoped a protocol for best practice and a framework for further research could be developed from this search.Can a protocol for best practice and a framework for further research be established from previous literature relating to non-computerised or non-recorded real time adult gait analysis in a musculoskeletal clinical setting.A literature review with no limitation on date of publication was conducted on the 18th February 2017.The review found no significantly informative papers relating to the search SIGNIFICANCE: The lack of research on the accuracy, reliability and therefore worth of this highly recommended area of musculoskeletal assessment raises concerns over current assessment and treatment pathways. Further work to develop a method by which gait analysis can be routinely employed in musculoskeletal clinics as a diagnostic tool is required, with any new approach undertaking robust methodological testing."
4,Musculoskeletal discomfort and use of computers in the university environment.,"This cross-sectional study investigated musculoskeletal discomfort and computer use in university staff, through the use of online questionnaires. Results showed a high prevalence of staff reported musculoskeletal discomfort during the preceding year (80%), with neck (60%), shoulder (53%) and lower back discomfort (47%) being the most common. Most believed discomfort was caused by work, although neck discomfort was significantly less in those reporting excellent mental health (OR 0.44, p?€?<?€?0.01). Computer navigation was performed primarily by mouse (77%); however, using a touch pad increased the odds (OR 1.17, p?€?<?€?0.01) of wrist discomfort and the belief it was caused by work (OR 1.19, p?€?<?€?0.01). Few staff attended ergonomic training (16%) or requested workstation assessments (26%). However, high rates of staff reporting musculoskeletal discomfort sought professional treatment (range: 35.2% wrist/hand to 65.0% shoulder). Strategies are needed to address uptake of preventive measures and reduce reliance on medical treatments following musculoskeletal discomfort in universities."
4,Systematic review: risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders in musicians.,"Although many musicians suffer from musculoskeletal disorders, aetiological factors are unclear.To systematically search for and synthesize the best available evidence on risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders in musicians.A database search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Pedro, OTseeker and Psychinfo. A manual search was conducted in the journals Medical Problems of Performing Artists and Psychology of Music. Studies with an objective to investigate determinants associated with playing-related musculoskeletal disorders were included. Papers were selected based on adequacy of statistical methods for the purpose of the study. Search, first screening and selection were performed by one author. Two reviewers independently performed the final selection using full-text reports. Methodological quality assessment was performed by two reviewers independently.One case-control and 14 cross-sectional studies were included. Methodological quality was in general low. Large heterogeneity existed in study design, population, measurement of determinant and outcome and analysis techniques. Data were presented descriptively. Consistent results were found indicating that previous musculoskeletal injury, music performance anxiety, high levels of stress and being a female playing a stringed instrument seemed to be associated with more musculoskeletal disorders. Influence over or support at work, orchestra category/status, exercise behaviour and cigarette smoking seemed to be unrelated with musculoskeletal disorders. No conclusions could be made on causality, as the current data only represent cross-sectional associations.Because of lack of prospective studies, no causal relations could be identified in the aetiology of (playing-related) musculoskeletal disorders in instrumental musicians."
4,Relationship of musculoskeletal pain and well-being at work - Does pain matter?,"Musculoskeletal pain is a common symptom and many people even with chronic pain continue to work. The aim of our study is to analyze how musculoskeletal pain affects work well-being by comparing work engagement in employees with or without pain, and how pain-related risk of disability is associated with work engagement. In a separate analysis, we also studied, how psychosocial factors are related to work engagement.This is a cross-sectional study of Finnish female employees of the city of Pori, Finland (PORi To Aid Against Threats (PORTAAT) study). Data was collected by trained study nurses and self-administrated questionnaires. Work well-being was measured by work engagement using Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9) questionnaire and the burden of pain was measured by using the short version of ??rebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (??MPSQ). Study population was divided into four groups: those without pain and the groups with low (I), medium (II) or high (III) ??MPSQ score, reflecting increasing risk of long term disability due to musculoskeletal pain. The study nurse assessed psychosocial risk factors using defined core questions.We evaluated 702 female employees, 601 (86%) had suffered from musculoskeletal pain over the past 12 months, whereas 101 (14%) reported no pain at all. Pain was chronic (duration at least 3 months) in 465/601 (77%) subjects. Subjects with musculoskeletal pain were older, had higher BMI and were on sick leave more often than subjects without pain. Of the psychosocial risk factors, depression, type D personality, anxiety and hostility were significantly more common among subjects with musculoskeletal pain. Hypertension and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were significantly more frequent in the musculoskeletal pain group. Quality of sleep and working capability were significantly better among persons without pain. Average weekly working hours were slightly higher among those with musculoskeletal pain. In crude analysis, work engagement (UWES-9) was similar in women without pain and those with musculoskeletal pain (4.96 vs. 4.79; p=0.091). After adjustment for age, education years, BMI, working hours and financial satisfaction, the difference between the groups became statistically significant (p=0.036). Still, there was no difference between the groups of no-pain and low burden of pain (p=0.21, after adjustment). Work engagement was significantly lower in the groups of medium (p=0.024, after adjusted) and high (p<0.001, after adjustment) burden of pain. Linearity across the Linton tertiles was significant (p<0.001). In univariate and multivariate ordered logistic regression analyses relating study variables to the work engagement musculoskeletal pain per se did not enter in the model to explain work engagement. Work and family stress, type D personality and duration of sick leave due to pain reduced work engagement, whereas financial satisfaction, moderate and high leisure time physical activity and higher BMI improved it.Among women with musculoskeletal pain psychosocial and lifestyle factors significantly correlate with work engagement, while the pain itself does not.Special attention should be paid to the psychosocial aspects in female employees with musculoskeletal pain to improve work well-being and maintain work ability."
4,Playing-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders of Professional Orchestra Musicians from the North of Portugal: Comparing String and Wind Musicians.,"It is well known that musicians are a group prone to suffer from playing-related musculoskeletal disorders. Professional??orchestra musicians play for several hours a week and have to fight against pain caused by their profession. The aim of this study was??to explore and describe self-reported complaints among professional orchestra musicians and to compare its intensity and the prevalence??between string and wind instruments.Hundred and twelve professional orchestra musicians from the three main professional orchestras from the??North of Portugal were individually interviewed about the prevalence and the intensity (measured by verbal numerical scale for pain) of??their playing-related musculoskeletal disorders.About two third (62.5%) of the interviewed musicians presented playing-related musculoskeletal disorders during the time of??the interview. Despite there are no significant statistic values between groups, results suggested that playing-related musculoskeletal??disorders are more common in string players and more intense in wind players.Referring to the prevalence of playing-related musculoskeletal disorders, our data is in line with other studies from different??countries. More than half of professional orchestra musicians in the North of Portugal are playing with a mild to moderate pain.Future studies focusing on working-related problems among professional orchestra musicians in Portugal would be useful??to better describe the problem of occupational diseases among performing artist."
4,Prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain symptoms among school-age adolescents: age and sex differences.,"Non-specific musculoskeletal pain symptoms are common in adolescents and may differ between the sexes, and be related to age and daily activities. It is critical to examine the prevalence and frequency of symptoms in adolescent students who tend to have pain which interferes with their routine activities. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and frequency of self-reported musculoskeletal pain symptoms by age and sex, and we also examined the association of symptoms with routine activities of school-age adolescents by area of pain.A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Thai students aged 10-19 years. All 2,750 students were asked to report previous 7-day and/or 12-month pain using the Standardized Nordic Questionnaire (Thai version) in 10 body areas. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age and sex was used to analyze the association between daily activity and musculoskeletal pain symptoms.A total of 76.1% (n=2,093) of students reported experiencing pain in the previous 7 days, 73.0% (n=2,007) reported in the previous 12-month period and 83.8% (n=2,304) reported pain in both 7-day and 12-month periods. The most common pain area was from a headache, with other areas being neck and shoulders, in that order, for both periods of time. The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was especially higher in older groups and females. Participants reported frequency of pain as ""sometimes in different areas"" ranging from 78.4% to 88% and severity of pain at 3.82??2.06 out of 10 (95% CI 3.74-3.91). Routine daily activities associated with symptoms of headache, neck, shoulders, and ankles or feet pain were computer use (head, OR=2.22), school bag carrying (neck, OR=2.05), school bag carrying (shoulder, OR=3.09), and playing sports (ankle or foot, OR=2.68).The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain symptoms was high in both the previous 7-day and 12-month periods, especially in females and older adolescents, although most of them sometimes experienced pain. Computer use and school bag carrying were associated with headache, neck and shoulder pain, while playing sports was related to symptoms of the foot and ankle.The prevalence of pain was high, particularly in the older and female groups. Although they experienced mild symptoms sometimes, the related daily activities leading to these symptoms should be closely noticed."
4,"Epidemiology of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Symptoms and Illnesses among Brick Kiln Workers in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal.","Background Workers in the brick manufacturing industries require to carry heavy loads, do repetitive work and remain in awkward postures for extended periods of time. These activities may cause them to develop work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders. Objective To investigate the epidemiology of musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders among brick manufacturing workers as well as similar exposure groups among brick kiln workers. Method An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted during February - March 2015 in the Kathmandu Valley. From 16 brick kilns, 400 interviewees involving green brick molding, green brick stacking/carrying, red brick loading/carrying, coal crushing/ carrying and firing were recruited. An unmatched equal size of reference group of grocery workers was maintained for comparison. Prevalence of all musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders were computed and compared among brick workers and grocery workers as well as similar exposure groups among brick kiln workers. Result The musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders were prevalent in 90.5% of the exposed and 82.2% of the reference group. Brick kiln workers were about two times more likely to experience musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders compared to the reference group. When the associations among similar exposure groups were evaluated, there were significantly high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders among green brick molders, red brick loaders/carriers and coal crushers/ carriers in comparison to firemen. Conclusion This study showed a high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders among brick kilns workers. Among all similar exposure groups, coal crushing/carrying task significantly elevated with all types of musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders."
4,Chronic musculoskeletal pain and its impact on older people.,"Musculoskeletal conditions are the leading cause of disability worldwide and also have a large impact on many other aspects of older people's health such as low physical activity level, poor mobility, frailty, depression, cognitive impairment, falls and poor sleep quality. Clustering of musculoskeletal pain with other pain conditions is also common, and the number of pain sites is an important prognostic factor. While musculoskeletal pain is usually nociceptive in origin, older people with musculoskeletal conditions may also experience neuropathic pain and central pain syndromes. Musculoskeletal burden of disease is increasing because of rapid ageing of populations, especially in developing countries. Interaction of musculoskeletal pain with co-existing conditions, including other types of pain, needs to be studied in longitudinal studies to identify modifiable targets for intervention. Additionally, potential impacts of musculoskeletal pain and prognostic factors need to be investigated in developing countries where evidence is scarce."
4,Effects of Yoga on Musculoskeletal Pain.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Musculoskeletal pain has been associated with work stress and a shortened career in the dental hygiene profession. The purpose of this study was to determine if participating in two yoga sessions per week would reduce the musculoskeletal pain reported by dental hygiene students and or impact body composition.<b>Methods:</b> A convenience sample of 77 dental hygiene students self-selected into treatment (yoga) and control groups. Students in the yoga group participated in bi-weekly, 60-minute yoga sessions for 13 consecutive weeks. Students completed a questionnaire and a Comparative Pain Scale evaluation prior to and immediately following the study period to assess musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, the Omron HBF-514C Full Body Composition Sensing Monitor and Scale was used to measure body mass index (BMI), body fat, and muscle prior to and upon completion of the study. Paired sample t-tests and independent t-tests were used to analyze the data.<b>Results:</b> Thirty-eight dental hygiene students, with an average age of 23.9 years, participated in the yoga group and 39 were assigned to the control group. The majority of the participants were Caucasian (63.6%) females (90.9%). Participants in both groups were of similar age, ethnicity, and had comparable pre-study Harich Comparative Pain Scale scores. After participating in the yoga sessions, the treatment group reported a significant decrease in musculoskeletal pain (p<0.001), while the control group reported no significant decrease in musculoskeletal pain (p=0.881). The yoga sessions did not significantly impact the BMI scores for the yoga treatment group (p=.984) or the control group (p=.901).<b>Conclusion:</b> This research supports the practice of bi-weekly yoga sessions as beneficial in decreasing musculoskeletal pain in dental hygiene students. Yoga can be considered a viable complementary health approach to incorporate into student schedules as a means of increasing the health and longevity of a dental hygiene career."
4,Associations between multimorbidity and additional burden for working-age adults with specific forms of musculoskeletal conditions: a cross-sectional study.,"Multiple health conditions are increasingly a problem for adults with musculoskeletal conditions. However, multimorbidity research has focused primarily on the elderly and those with a limited subset of musculoskeletal disorders. We sought to determine whether associations between multimorbidity and additional burden differ with specific forms of musculoskeletal conditions among working-age adults.Data were sourced from a nationally representative Australian survey. Specific musculoskeletal conditions examined were osteoarthritis; inflammatory arthritis; other forms of arthritis or arthropathies; musculoskeletal conditions not elsewhere specified; gout; back pain; soft tissue disorders; or osteoporosis. Multimorbidity was defined as the additional presence of one or more of the Australian National Health Priority Area conditions. Burden was assessed by self-reported measures of: (i) self-rated health (ii) musculoskeletal-related healthcare and medicines utilisation and, (iii) general healthcare utilisation. Associations between multimorbidity and additional health or healthcare utilisation burden among working-age adults (aged 18 - 64??years of age) with specific musculoskeletal conditions were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for confounders. Interaction terms were fitted to identify whether there were specific musculoskeletal conditions where multimorbidity was more strongly associated with poorer health or greater healthcare utilisation than in the remaining musculoskeletal group.Among working-age adults, for each of the specified musculoskeletal conditions, multimorbidity was associated with similar, increased likelihood of additional self-rated health burden and certain types of healthcare utilisation. While there were differences in the relationships between multimorbidity and burden for each of the specific musculoskeletal conditions, no one specific musculoskeletal condition appeared to be consistently associated with greater additional health burden in the presence of multimorbidity across the majority of self-rated health burden and healthcare use measures.For working-age people with any musculoskeletal conditions examined here, multimorbidity increases self-reported health and healthcare utilisation burden. As no one musculoskeletal condition appears consistently worse off in the presence of multimorbidity, there is a need to better understand and identify strategies that acknowledge and address the additional burden of concomitant conditions for working-age adults with a range of musculoskeletal conditions."
4,"Musculoskeletal pain and its associated risk factors among medical students of a public sector University in Karachi, Pakistan.","To assess the frequency and anatomical distribution of musculoskeletal pain and its related risk factors.This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Dow Medical College, Karachi, from September to November 2016, and comprised medical students. A self-administered questionnaire was filled out by the participants. Data was analysed using SPSS 17.Of the 360 participants, 268(74.4%)and 140(38.9%)students reported having musculoskeletal pain in at least one of the body sites in the past 12 months and in the past seven days, respectively. Self-reported mental stress (p=0.01) and history of trauma in the neck, shoulder or lower back (p=0.002) were the most significant predictors of musculoskeletal pain during the past seven days. Age, body mass index, gender, academic year, family history of musculoskeletal disorders, hours of clinical practice per day, hours of study per day, smoking and exercise had no significant relation with musculoskeletal pain in neck, shoulder or lower back (p>0.05 each). The use of computer/laptop for more than three hours per day had an increased occurrence of neck pain (p=0.03)..There was a significant risk of musculoskeletal pain for medical students."
4,Musculoskeletal Pain and Interest in Meditation and Yoga in Home Health Aides: Evidence From the Home Health Occupations Musculoskeletal Examinations (HHOME) Study.,"Home healthcare aides (HHAs) are a growing U.S. workforce highly susceptible to workplace stressors and musculoskeletal pain. In the present study we: 1) examine the association of musculoskeletal pain to life satisfaction and emotional exhaustion; and 2) characterize interest in meditation and yoga in a sample of HHAs. A nonprobabilistic sample of HHAs employed at home healthcare agencies in Florida, Massachusetts, and Oregon (n = 285 total) completed a self-administered questionnaire with standard survey measures on musculoskeletal pain location, duration, and severity; life satisfaction; emotional exhaustion; and interest in meditation techniques and yoga. Among HHAs responding, 48.4% reported pain in the last 7 days and 46.6% reported pain in the last 3 months. Home healthcare aides who reported current pain and chronic pain had a significant (P < .05) decrease in satisfaction with life score and a significant increase in emotional exhaustion score. The majority of HHAs reported an interest in learning about the benefits (65.6%) and practice (66.4%) of meditation and a willingness to participate in a yoga class (59.2%) or stress management meeting (59.1%). The HHAs reported both acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain that was correlated with lower life satisfaction and greater emotional exhaustion. More efforts are needed to reduce the sources of injury and emotional exhaustion."
4,Severe musculoskeletal time-loss injuries and symptoms of common mental disorders in professional soccer: a longitudinal analysis of 12-month follow-up data.,"Psychological factors have shown to be predictors of injury in professional football. However, it seems that this is a two-way relationship, as severe musculoskeletal time-loss injuries have shown to be associated with the onset of symptoms of common mental disorders (CMD). There is no longitudinal study performed exploring this interaction between symptoms of CMD and injuries. The purpose of this study was to explore the interaction between severe musculoskeletal time-loss injuries and symptoms of CMD in professional football players over a 12-month period.Players were recruited by their national players' unions in five European countries. Symptoms of CMD included in the study were related to distress, anxiety/depression, sleep disturbance and adverse alcohol use.A total of 384 professional football players were enrolled in the study, of whom 262 (68%) completed the 12-month follow-up period. The mean age of the participants at baseline was 27??????5??years, and they had played professional football for 8??????5??years on average. Symptoms of CMD at baseline were not associated with the onset of severe musculoskeletal time-loss injuries during the follow-up period with relative risks (and 95% CI) ranging from 0.6 (0.3-1.0) to 1.0 (0.5-2.2). In contrast, severe musculoskeletal time-loss injuries reported at baseline were associated with the onset of symptoms of CMD during the follow-up period with relative risks ranging from 1.8 (0.8-3.7) to 6.9 (4.0-11.9).No relationship was found between symptoms of CMD and the onset of severe musculoskeletal time-loss injuries. However, professional football players who suffered from severe musculoskeletal time-loss injuries are likely to develop subsequent symptoms of CMD. This study emphasizes the need for an interdisciplinary medical approach, which not only focuses on the physical but also on the mental health of professional football players. An early identification of players at risk of symptoms of CMD, such as those suffering from severe musculoskeletal injuries, creates the opportunity for an interdisciplinary clinical medical team to treat the players timely and adequately.Prospective cohort study, Level II."
4,"Association between V??O<sub>2max</sub>, handgrip strength, and musculoskeletal pain among construction and health care workers.","Construction and health care workers have a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, and they are assumed to have physically demanding jobs. Profession- and gender-specific associations between individual capacity and musculoskeletal pain have not been sufficiently investigated. The main aim of this study was to examine the association between individual capacity (maximal oxygen uptake (V??O<sub>2max</sub>) and handgrip strength) and musculoskeletal pain among construction and health care workers.This cross-sectional study examined 137 construction and health care workers (58 women and 79 men) with a mean age of 41.8??years (standard deviation 12). Aerobic capacity was indirectly assessed by the ??strand cycle test, and strength was assessed by a handgrip test. Musculoskeletal pain was described by total pain, divided into neck, shoulder, and low back pain, during the last 12??months, and it was dichotomized in below or above 30??days. Logistic regression was used to analyse the associations between V??O<sub>2max</sub>, strength, and musculoskeletal pain in the total study sample and separately for construction and health care workers. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and selected mechanical and psychosocial factors.Every second participant (51.8%) reported pain in either neck, shoulders or low back for more than 30??days during the last 12??months. Among the health care workers, a small but significant association was found between a high V??O<sub>2max</sub>, high handgrip strength, and a low level of musculoskeletal pain. No association was found for the construction workers.An association between V??O<sub>2max,</sub> handgrip strength, and musculoskeletal pain was found for health care workers but not for construction workers. These results indicate that activities promoting individual capacity may reduce musculoskeletal pain for health care workers."
4,[The Tendencies of Prevalence of Diseases of Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue in Moscow Adult Population].,"The article presents the results of analysis of trends in morbidity and dispensary observation of Moscow adult population with diseases of musculoskeletal system and connective tissue. The analysis was applied to data from statistical report forms # 12 of the Moscow Health Care Department in 2012-2016. The stability of percentage of diseases of musculoskeletal system in the structure of total and primary morbidity during last 5 years was established. The significant dynamics of indices of total morbidity is absent. The statistically significant descending trend if primary morbidity at the expense of deforming dorsopathies in the age group older than 55 years was established. The deforming dorsopathies hold first place in the structure of diseases of musculoskeletal system. The dynamics of decreasing of indices of total morbidity of the given pathology in the age group of 18-55 years and older than 55 years is statistically non-significant. The statistically significant ascending tendency of indices of total morbidity of arthroses of adult population and primary morbidity of synovial membranes and tendons in the age group of 18-55 years is established. The established in adult population and individuals aged 18-55 years both decreasing of number of being dispensary registered on the subject of pathology of musculoskeletal system and its increasing among individuals older than 55 years are statistically non-significant. The trend of dropping of indicator of being on dispensary registration of individuals with primarily diagnosed pathology is also insignificant. The correlation between rate of dispensary registration and primary morbidity, including particular pathologies, is absent."
4,Work-related musculoskeletal discomfort among heavy truck drivers.,"Heavy truck drivers are exposed to various psychological, psychosocial and physiological factors, some of which can cause musculoskeletal discomfort in different body regions.This study aims to investigate the correlation between different factors of musculoskeletal discomfort in heavy truck drivers.A cross-sectional study design was applied. A total of 384 participants were interviewed using an updated version of the Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire. While hypothesis testing was used to assess the association of different factors in musculoskeletal discomfort, logistic regression was applied to explore different correlations among questions of the survey.The results demonstrate that hours of exposure to vibration were associated with discomfort in the neck and shoulders (p?€?<?€?0.001). This relationship was not statistically significant in the lower back area (p?€?=?€?0.300). Additionally, 19 equations, their correlations and their odds ratios were formulated with Nagelkerke R<sup>2</sup>?€?>?€?0.05.Fifty-seven percent of the drivers were suffering from discomfort in their lower back region. Moreover, seat comfort was found to be highly correlated with discomfort in the neck, shoulder and upper back areas. Additionally, with aging the likelihood of experiencing discomfort in the neck, upper back and knees is increased."
4,Can high social capital at the workplace buffer against stress and musculoskeletal pain?: Cross-sectional study.,"Work-related musculoskeletal pain and stress are both highly prevalent in the working environment and relate well to the biopsychosocial model. While the onset of musculoskeletal pain is often dependent on the biological element of the biopsychosocial model, chronic pain is often influenced by psychological and social factors. Similarly, stress is also influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors. This study investigates the possibility of social capital being a buffer for stress and musculoskeletal pain in a group of female laboratory technicians.Female laboratory technicians (n?€?=?€?500) replied to questions about stress (Cohens Perceived Stress Scale-10), musculoskeletal pain (0-10 visual analog scale), and social capital at the workplace (bonding [in teams], bridging [between teams], and linking [between teams and leaders]). Outcome variables were stress and musculoskeletal pain and the predictor variable was social capital. General linear models tested the association of the 3 types of social capital (predictor variables) with stress and pain (mutually adjusted outcome variables). Analyses were controlled for age, lifestyle (body mass index, smoking), seniority, and working hours per week.For stress as outcome, moderate and high bonding social capital were different from low social capital with -2.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] -3.33 to -0.76) and -4.56 (95% CI -5.84 to -3.28) points on the Perceived Stress Scale of 0 to 42, respectively. Similarly, moderate and high bridging social capital were different from low social capital with -1.50 (95% CI -2.76 to -0.24) and -4.39 (95% CI -5.75 to -3.03), respectively. For linking, only high social was significantly different from low with -2.94 (95% CI -4.28 to -1.60). None of the 3 types of social capital was associated with musculoskeletal pain.Higher levels of social capital at the workplace appear to buffer against stress, but not against musculoskeletal pain. Intervention studies should investigate whether improving bonding, bridging, and linking social capital at the workplace may be a viable strategy to prevent or reduce work-related stress."
4,Clinical course and prognosis of musculoskeletal pain in patients referred for physiotherapy: does pain site matter?,"Danish patients with musculoskeletal disorders are commonly referred for primary care physiotherapy treatment but little is known about their general health status, pain diagnoses, clinical course and prognosis. The objectives of this study were to 1) describe the clinical course of patients with musculoskeletal disorders referred to physiotherapy, 2) identify predictors associated with a satisfactory outcome, and 3) determine the influence of the primary pain site diagnosis relative to those predictors.This was a prospective cohort study of patients (n?€?=?€?2,706) newly referred because of musculoskeletal pain to 30 physiotherapy practices from January 2012 to May 2012. Data were collected via a web-based questionnaire 1-2 days prior to the first physiotherapy consultation and at 6??weeks, 3 and 6??months, from clinical records (including primary musculoskeletal symptom diagnosis based on the ICPC-2 classification system), and from national registry data. The main outcome was the Patient Acceptable Symptom State. Potential predictors were analysed using backwards step-wise selection during longitudinal Generalised Estimating Equation regression modelling. To assess the influence of pain site on these associations, primary pain site diagnosis was added to the model.Of the patients included, 66% were female and the mean age was 48 (SD 15). The percentage of patients reporting their symptoms as acceptable was 32% at 6??weeks, 43% at 3??months and 52% at 6??months. A higher probability of satisfactory outcome was associated with place of residence, being retired, no compensation claim, less frequent pain, shorter duration of pain, lower levels of disability and fear avoidance, better mental health and being a non-smoker. Primary pain site diagnosis had little influence on these associations, and was not predictive of a satisfactory outcome.Only half of the patients rated their symptoms as acceptable at 6??months. Although satisfactory outcome was difficult to predict at an individual patient level, there were a number of prognostic factors that were associated with this outcome. These factors should be considered when developing generic prediction tools to assess the probability of satisfactory outcome in musculoskeletal physiotherapy patients, because the site of pain did not affect that prognostic association."
4,Can breast characteristics predict upper torso musculoskeletal pain?,"Several studies have associated a large breast size with an increased prevalence and severity of musculoskeletal pain, particularly pain in the upper torso. Despite this evidence, no research has explored whether breast size or related characteristics are risk factors for upper torso musculoskeletal pain.A backward multiple regression analysis was performed to identify whether characteristics of the breasts and upper torso, as well as physical factors known to be associated with musculoskeletal pain, could predict musculoskeletal pain among a cohort of 378 Australian women aged 18?€?years and over who had a wide range of breast sizes.The model identified that breast volume, age and nipple-to-nipple distance predicted 23% of the variance in upper torso musculoskeletal pain reported by the participants.Women with a larger breast volume, lower age and a greater nipple-to-nipple distance were predicted to report a higher upper torso musculoskeletal pain score."
4,Work-related musculoskeletal symptoms among otolaryngologists by subspecialty: A national survey.,"Given the high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal symptoms, increased appreciation for workplace ergonomics is critical. The purpose of this study is to assess work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and injury among otolaryngologists across subspecialties, as well as to quantify the understanding and application of ergonomic principles in the operating room.Cross-sectional study.An online REDCap survey was distributed electronically to University of Kansas faculty, alumni, and residents; members of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery; and residency program coordinators for distribution to residents and faculty between August 2016 and March 2017. The survey assessed caseload, ergonomic practices, and associated musculoskeletal symptoms by type of procedure and impact of symptoms on surgeon practice.The survey was distributed to 3,006 individuals. We received 377 responses (12.5%), with 63.9% reporting symptoms. The majority of respondents began to experience symptoms in residency or fellowship. Neck and shoulder were the most affected body areas across all types of surgeries. One-third of surgeons were formally taught or actively sought information on ergonomics principles. Among those who applied ergonomics in practice, 69.6% observed improvement in their symptoms.Although musculoskeletal issues are prevalent among otolaryngologists, awareness of surgical ergonomics principles among otolaryngologists remains limited. Early instruction in ergonomic principles is important because work-related musculoskeletal symptoms commonly present in residency. Most respondents reporting the application of ergonomic principles also acknowledge symptom improvement.NA. Laryngoscope, 128:632-640, 2018."
4,"Biological Stress Systems, Adverse Life Events, and the Improvement of Chronic Multisite Musculoskeletal Pain Across a 6-Year Follow-Up.","Dysfunction of biological stress systems and adverse life events, independently and in interaction, have been hypothesized to predict chronic pain persistence. Conversely, these factors may hamper the improvement of chronic pain. Longitudinal evidence is currently lacking. We examined whether: 1) function of biological stress systems, 2) adverse life events, and 3) their combination predict the improvement of chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain. Subjects of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) with chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain at baseline (N = 665) were followed-up 2, 4, and 6??years later. The Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire was used to determine improvement (not meeting the criteria) of chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain at follow-up. Baseline assessment of biological stress systems included function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (1-hour cortisol awakening response, evening level, and post dexamethasone level), the immune system (basal and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inflammatory markers), the autonomic??nervous system (heart rate, pre-ejection period, SD of the normal-to-normal interval, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia). The number of adverse life events were assessed at baseline and 2-year follow-up using the List of Threatening Events Questionnaire. We showed that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, immune system, and autonomic nervous system functioning and adverse life events were not associated with the improvement of chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain, either as a main effect or in interaction. This longitudinal study could not confirm that biological stress system dysfunction and adverse life events affect the course of chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain.Biological stress systems and adverse life events are not associated with the improvement of chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain over 6??years of follow-up. Other determinants should thus be considered in future research to identify in which persons pain symptoms will improve."
4,Effect of Breast Size on Upper Torso Musculoskeletal Structure and Function: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Research has shown that women with large and hypertrophic breast sizes report an increased prevalence and severity of musculoskeletal pain in the upper torso. Despite this evidence, factors contributing to the development of musculoskeletal pain among these women are poorly understood, and the threshold at which breast size becomes problematic in terms of musculoskeletal pain is currently unknown.Three hundred Australian women (aged 18 to 82 years) who volunteered as participants were divided into four breast size groups (small, breast volume <350 ml; medium, breast volume 350 to 700 ml; large, breast volume 701 to 1200 ml; and hypertrophic, breast volume >1200 ml). The thoracic flexion torque, thoracic kyphosis angle, total upper torso musculoskeletal pain score, and regional upper torso musculoskeletal pain scores derived for participants in the four groups were compared using an analysis of covariance design, controlling for age and body mass index.Thoracic flexion torque significantly increased as breast size group increased. Women with hypertrophic breasts reported significantly higher total upper torso musculoskeletal pain scores compared with women who had small, medium, and large breasts, and this was significant for the upper back, shoulders, neck, and breasts. No significant difference was found in thoracic kyphosis angle among the four groups.Musculoskeletal pain became most pronounced in women with hypertrophic breasts who had the greatest breast volume and displayed the greatest thoracic flexion torque. Clinical and/or surgical treatment for symptomatic relief should aim to either counteract thoracic flexion torque or reduce breast volume.Risk, I."
4,Validation and Use of a Musculoskeletal Gait Model to Study the Role of Functional Electrical Stimulation.,"Musculoskeletal modeling has been used to predict the effect of functional electrical stimulation (FES) on the mechanics of the musculoskeletal system. However, validation of the resulting muscle activations due to FES is challenging as conventional electromyography (EMG) recording of signals from the stimulated muscle is affected by stimulation artefacts. A validation approach using a combination of musculoskeletal modeling and EMG was proposed, whereby the effect on nonstimulated muscles is assessed using both techniques. The aim is to quantify the effect of FES on biceps femoris long head (BFLH) and validate this directly against EMG of gluteus maximus (GMAX). The hypotheses are that GMAX activation correlates with BFLH activation; and the muscle activation during FES gait can be predicted using musculoskeletal modeling.Kinematics, kinetics, and EMG of healthy subjects were measured under four walking conditions (normal walking followed by FES walking with three levels of BFLH stimulation). Measured kinematics and kinetics served as inputs to the musculoskeletal model.Strong positive correlations were found between GMAX activation and BFLH activation in early stance peak (R = 0.78, p = 0.002) and impulse (R = 0.63, p = 0.021). The modeled peak and impulse of GMAX activation increased with EMG peak (p < 0.001) and impulse (p = 0.021).Musculoskeletal modeling can be used reliably to quantify the effect of FES in a healthy gait.The validation approach using EMG and musculoskeletal modeling developed and tested can potentially be applied to the use of FES for other muscles and activities."
4,Chronic musculoskeletal pain in European older adults: Cross-national and gender differences.,"In an ageing Europe, chronic pain is a major public health problem, but robust epidemiological data are scarce. This study aimed to analyse the prevalence of and factors associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain by gender in older adults of 14 European countries.A cross-sectional study was performed from wave 5 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The study included people ???50 years residing in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Chronic pain was defined as being bothered by joint and/or back pain for the previous 6??months. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance were performed to analyse prevalence ratio by covariates, stratified by sex.A total of 61,157 participants were included. Overall prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal pain was 35.7% (28.8-31.7), ranging from 18.6% (17.1-20.1) for Switzerland to 45.6% (43.3-47.8) for France. Prevalence was higher in women than in men: 41.3% (40.2-42.4) versus 29.1% (28.0-30.3). Chronic musculoskeletal pain was lower in men aged >75 years (PR??=??0.82; 0.72-0.92) than the younger (50-59) group. Separated/divorced status presented opposite effects among men (PR??=??0.85; 0.76-0.96) and women (PR??=??1.12; 1.03-1.21) compared with married, and unemployment was a significant factor in men (PR??=??1.21; 95% CI 1.02-1.43) compared with employed.Musculoskeletal pain in older European adults is very frequent, especially in women, with large differences depending on the country of residence. Health policy makers should prioritize strategies aimed at improving the prevention and management of chronic musculoskeletal pain in Europe.This study provides epidemiological data of chronic musculoskeletal pain in older adults. Reported differences contribute to highlight the relevance of considering a gender perspective in chronic musculoskeletal pain research. Cross-national comparison also offers a map of differences that improves the knowledge of this chronic condition in Europe."
4,"Developing predictive models for return to work using the Military Power, Performance and Prevention (MP3) musculoskeletal injury risk algorithm: a study protocol for an injury risk assessment programme.","Musculoskeletal injuries are a primary source of disability in the US Military, and low back pain and lower extremity injuries account for over 44% of limited work days annually. History of prior musculoskeletal injury increases the risk for future injury. This study aims to determine the risk of injury after returning to work from a previous injury. The objective is to identify criteria that can help predict likelihood for future injury or re-injury.There will be 480 active duty soldiers recruited from across four medical centres. These will be patients who have sustained a musculoskeletal injury in the lower extremity or lumbar/thoracic spine, and have now been cleared to return back to work without any limitations. Subjects will undergo a battery of physical performance tests and fill out sociodemographic surveys. They will be followed for a year to identify any musculoskeletal injuries that occur. Prediction algorithms will be derived using regression analysis from performance and sociodemographic variables found to be significantly different between injured and non-injured subjects.Due to the high rates of injuries, injury prevention and prediction initiatives are growing. This is the first study looking at predicting re-injury rates after an initial musculoskeletal injury. In addition, multivariate prediction models appear to have move value than models based on only one variable. This approach aims to validate a multivariate model used in healthy non-injured individuals to help improve variables that best predict the ability to return to work with lower risk of injury, after a recent musculoskeletal injury.NCT02776930."
4,Rehabilitation needs in oncological patients: the On-rehab project results on patients operated for musculoskeletal tumors.,"Rehabilitation plays an important role in improving functional outcome in patients operated on musculoskeletal tumors. Literature in the field is scarce and the specific needs for rehabilitation of these patients are still unknown.To analyze the rehabilitation needs of patients with primary malignant musculoskeletal tumors.Observational, longitudinal study on both inpatient and outpatient operated on musculoskeletal tumors.Rehabilitation needs of oncological patients were explored by means of questionnaires administered by a physician. Demographic, oncological, psychological domains were also assessed.Twenty-nine patients were evaluated in the immediate post-operative period, 25 patients had a follow up at 6 months, and 11 patients at 12 months. Rehabilitation needs concerned essentially the neuromotor function and the improvement of independence at home/outside home. At first admission, support for occupational rehabilitation was also relevant, while its importance was reduced over the follow-up. Pain control need was greater at first admission (VAS over the follow-up 3.3, 0.52, and 1.09, respectively) and required treatment with painkillers. Quality of life (EORTC) increased over the three assessments (respectively 48.80; 71.42; 82.14). The Psychological Distress Inventory (PDI) scores were 26.23, 21.75, 23.6, and the Caregiver Needs Assessment (CNA) scores were 32.69, 27.95, and 31.7 respectively at the three follow up.The relevant domains in which rehabilitation needs emerged in up to 1 year follow up were the neuromotor area in order to gain independence at home and outside the home, pain control, particularly after surgery, nursing, psychological support of patients and caregivers, and occupational activities (personal, work, school, social).The findings of the present study suggest that: short and midterm clinical rehabilitation programs should be made available for patients operated on musculoskeletal tumors. Physical function recovery is only one aspect of rehabilitation, and psychosocial functioning must be taken into account and coordinated by a comprehensive team of specialists. Appropriate assessment tools should be used, and a continuum of care from the hospital to the patient's home should be promoted."
4,A population analysis of self-management and health-related quality of life for chronic musculoskeletal conditions.,"There is growing policy emphasis on self-management as an essential component of musculoskeletal chronic care models. Underpinning this drive is the assumption that with correct 'informational' framing people will better manage their condition's progression and thereby maintain quality of life.To assess associations between self-management behaviours and health-related quality of life for people with chronic musculoskeletal conditions.Using survey data from health census and follow-up structured telephone interviews, linear regression (cumulatively adjusted for potential confounders) and logistic regression examined associations between use of specific self-management behaviours and quality of life.A total of 885 respondents (2012) who indicated still having a musculoskeletal condition reported in a 2010 health census (Port Lincoln, South Australia).Specific self-management activities, age, sex, education, marital status, smoking, comorbidities and pain.EQ-5D-5L.Exercise (63%) and diet (19%) were the most commonly reported self-management activities used to manage musculoskeletal conditions. About 24% reported not using any specific self-management activities. Involvement in self-management showed no association with quality of life, with and without adjustment for confounders. Diet had a negative association with quality of life as did use of formal support (self-management course or community group support).Taking a real-world perspective, these findings raise important questions about how people currently engage with self-management activities and the kinds of outcomes that can be expected from undertaking these activities. The timing of people's uptake of self-management within the musculoskeletal disease continuum is an issue requiring further attention in both research and practice."
4,Review article: Methodology for the 'rapid review' series on musculoskeletal injuries in the emergency department.,"Musculoskeletal injuries are a common presentation to the ED, with significant costs involved in the management of these injuries, variances in care within the ED and associated morbidity. A series of rapid review papers were completed to guide best practice for the assessment and management of common musculoskeletal injuries presenting to the ED. This paper presents the methodology used across the rapid reviews. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2015. The search was repeated consistently for each topic area (injuries of the foot and ankle, knee, hand and wrist, elbow, shoulder, lumbar spine and cervical spine). English-language primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines that were published in the last 10 years and addressed acute musculoskeletal injury management were considered for inclusion. Data extraction of each included article was conducted, followed by a quality appraisal. The extracted data from each article was synthesised to group similar evidence together. For each rapid review, the evidence has been organised in a way that a clinician can direct their attention to a specific component of the clinical cycle of care in the ED, such as the assessment, diagnostic tests, management and follow-up considerations from ED. The series of rapid reviews are designed to foster evidence-based practice within the ED, targeting the injuries most commonly presenting. The reviews provide clinicians in EDs with rapid access to the best current evidence, which has been synthesised and organised to assist decision-making."
4,The Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP) in Patients with Headache and Musculoskeletal Pain: A Retrospective Analysis of Clinical Data.,"Headache and musculoskeletal pain are associated with both physical and mental health symptoms, which together are mutually reinforcing. Addressing mental and physical health symptoms (including pain) concomitantly may provide an effective and efficient way to improve outcomes in this population. We tested an evidence-based, eight-session multimodal group program, the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP), in patients with headache and musculoskeletal pain. A total of 109 adults (30 with headaches, 79 with musculoskeletal pain).Participant were 109 adults (30 with headaches, 79 with musculoskeletal pain) referred by their medical doctor, who completed a battery of questionnaires before and after completion of the 3RP.On average, patients with headache and musculoskeletal pain had higher pretreatment scores for anxiety, depression, and somatization symptoms than the nonpatient normative sample for the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised. Significant improvements were identified from pre- to post-treatment in all mental health symptoms (moderate to large effects) and frequency of pain and co-occurring physical health symptoms (small to moderate effects). Patients also reported significant decreases in degree of discomfort and life interference, which were relatively more modest in the musculoskeletal pain group compared with the headache group.Overall, results of this study suggest that the 3RP may be an effective treatment for reducing pain and psychological symptoms in patients with headaches and musculoskeletal pain. Future work is needed to evaluate the 3RP via a randomized clinical trial in these patient populations."
4,Prevalence of musculoskeletal pains and effect of work-related factors among employees on offshore oil and gas installations in Iran.,"Work-related musculoskeletal pain is usually caused by poor physical conditions, repetitive motion, and adverse environmental and psychological situations.This study aims to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain and their work-related factors among employees on offshore oil and gas installations in Iran.Standardized Nordic Questionnaire was used to collect data. The relationship of musculoskeletal pain with job type, rest breaks, exercise, shift program, and work period was studied among employees on offshore installations. T-test and ANOVA were used for data analysis.Employees on offshore installations were exposed to high levels of risk of musculoskeletal pain in their knees and back. Consequently, they reported the highest level of complaints of pain in the neck and lower back areas. Workers in drilling and tour-scheduling jobs reported the highest level of musculoskeletal pain. In the course of seven days and 12 months, the highest level of significant relationship was observed between the limbs and the work periods (tour scheduling or days-off) of the staff.The findings showed that the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among employees of offshore facilities was high due to inappropriate working conditions such as repetitive work, lifting heavy loads and limited rest periods. Therefore, strategies must be considered to reduce the effects of disorders."
4,Effect of musculoskeletal pain of care workers on job satisfaction.,"[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to examine the musculoskeletal pain of care workers and investigate its effect on their job satisfaction. [Subjects and Methods] Subjects were 87 care workers working at C elderly care service center in P region. The average age of men was 62.5 ?? 3.4?€?years and that of women was 57.3 ?? 2.7?€?years. The 'Guidelines for Risk Factor Survey on Tasks with Musculoskeletal Burden' of the KOSHA CODE (H-30-2003) of the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency (KOSHA) was used for measurement of musculoskeletal pain. This survey tool for job satisfaction consisted of 12 questions including the areas of wage satisfaction, professional satisfaction, job performance satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. [Results] Study results showed that musculoskeletal pain varied depending on professional satisfaction, job performance satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. The correlation between the areas of musculoskeletal pain and job satisfaction was examined and the following was revealed. Professional satisfaction was correlated with arm/elbow pain and lower back pain, job performance satisfaction with lower back pain, and relationship satisfaction with shoulder pain and lower back pain. [Conclusion] In this study, subjects were older and could have been easily exposed to diseases because of their age. To improve job efficiency among care workers, continuing education related to the job should take precedence. In addition, social support is required that can alleviate the heavy workload related to physical activity support, which is among the responsibilities of care workers. Moreover, application standards and coverage of industrial insurance for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders of care workers should be extended further to relieve the burden of medical costs. A series of such measures will have a positive effect on improving the job satisfaction of care workers."
4,Investigation of musculoskeletal symptoms in a manufacturing company in Brazil: a cross-sectional study.,"Musculoskeletal disorders are prevalent and represent the most common health problem among the working population in industrially-developing countries, with considerable costs and impact on quality of life. Despite the high incidence of disability insurance claims among Brazilian manufacturing-sector workers, only a few studies assessed musculoskeletal disorders prevalence.To provide information on the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among manufacturing-sector workers and to explore the relationship between musculoskeletal disorders and sociodemographic and occupational characteristics in a medium metallurgical company located in Brazil.A cross-sectional study was carried out. Data was collected through the use of a specifically-designed questionnaire and the items used to collect musculoskeletal disorders data were based on the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used and multivariate logistic regression analysis (p<0.02) was performed to explore the associations between musculoskeletal disorders and potential risk factors.The upper limb was the most frequently affected body region among manufacturing-sector workers: shoulder (24.8%), elbow and/or forearm (15.5%), wrist and/or hand (19.0%). Adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that company experience (p=0.02), presence of sleep disorders (p=0.00), self-reported general health state (p=0.00) and perform work pause (p=0.00) were significant risk factors for development of musculoskeletal disorders.Sociodemographic and work-related aspects are influential risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders. These results add comprehension about musculoskeletal disorders prevalence and suggest a need for greater emphasis on prevention strategies."
4,Cross-sectional examination of musculoskeletal conditions and multimorbidity: influence of different thresholds and definitions on prevalence and association estimates.,"Multimorbidity and musculoskeletal conditions create substantial burden for people and health systems. Quantifying the extent of co-occurring conditions is hampered by conceptual heterogeneity, imprecision and/or indecision about how multimorbidity is defined. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of different ways of operationalising multimorbidity on multimorbidity prevalence rates with a focus on working-age adults with musculoskeletal conditions. Weighted population prevalence rates of multimorbidity among working-age Australians were estimated using data from the National Health Survey. Two nominal thresholds (2+ or 3+ co-occurring conditions) and three operational definitions of multimorbidity (survey-, policy- and research-based) were examined. Using logistic regression, we estimated the association between the prevalence of multimorbidity among persons with musculoskeletal conditions compared to persons with non-musculoskeletal conditions for each definition and threshold combination.As few as 7.9% of working-age Australians have 2+ conditions using the research-based definition (95% CI 7.4-8.5%), compared to estimates of 15.3% (95% CI 14.3-16.2%) and 61.5% (95% CI 60.3-62.7%). with the policy- and survey-based definitions, respectively. Depending on definition, with the 3+ threshold multimorbidity prevalence ranged from 2.1% (research) to 41.9% (survey). Among the sub-sample with musculoskeletal conditions, multimorbidity with the 2+ threshold ranged from 20.2 to 92.2%; and with 3+ threshold from 5.9 to 75.4%, again lowest with the research-definition and highest with the survey-definition. When compared to any other condition (i.e. non-musculoskeletal conditions), all musculoskeletal conditions were positively associated with multimorbidity, regardless of definition or threshold.Depending on definition and threshold, multimorbidity is either rare or endemic in working-age Australians. Irrespective of definition, musculoskeletal conditions are a near-ubiquitous feature of multimorbidity."
4,Musculoskeletal pain and related factors in coronary artery disease: An observational cross-sectional study.,"In patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD), we aimed to determine the characteristics and risk factors of co-occurring musculoskeletal pain and examine its effects on functional capacity, psychological status and health-related quality of life.A total of 100 patients with (n= 50) and without (n= 50) musculoskeletal pain were enrolled. All patients were assessed on sociodemographic and clinical properties. The Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) were applied as clinical assessment scales.Patients with musculoskeletal pain were mostly female, and had a lower education level and annual income. The pain was mostly nociceptive, intermittent, sharp/stabbing in character, and located in the chest and spine. Having musculoskeletal pain resulted in lower levels on the DASI and all subgroups of the SF-36, and higher levels on the HADS. Female gender, lower education level and severity of emotional distress proved to be independent risk factors for the development of musculoskeletal pain.In CAD, the co-occurrence of musculoskeletal pain leads to a further decrease in health-related quality of life and functional status, and increased severity of anxiety and depression. This stresses the importance of the detection and optimal treatment of musculoskeletal pain in patients diagnosed with CAD."
4,"Work-Related Musculoskeletal Injuries in Plastic Surgeons in the United States, Canada, and Norway.","Musculoskeletal injuries are more common among surgeons than among the general population. However, little is known about these types of injuries among plastic surgeons specifically. The authors' goals were to evaluate the prevalence, nature, causes, and potential solutions of these musculoskeletal injuries among plastic surgeons in three different countries: the United States, Canada, and Norway.A survey was e-mailed to plastic surgeons in the United States, Canada, and Norway, soliciting their demographics, practice description, history of musculoskeletal issues, potential causes of these symptoms, and proposed suggestions to address these injuries. The prevalence of various musculoskeletal symptoms was calculated, and predictors of these symptoms were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression.The survey was sent to 3314 plastic surgeons, with 865 responses (response rate, 26.1 percent); 78.3 percent of plastic surgeons had musculoskeletal symptoms, most commonly in the neck, shoulders, and lower back. U.S. surgeons were significantly more likely to have musculoskeletal symptoms than Norwegian surgeons (79.5 percent versus 69.3 percent; p < 0.05); 6.7 percent of all respondents required surgical intervention for their symptoms. The most common causative factors were long surgery duration, tissue retraction, and prolonged neck flexion. The most common solutions cited were core-strengthening exercises, stretching exercises, and frequent adjustment of table height during surgery.Plastic surgeons are at high risk for work-related musculoskeletal injuries. Ergonomic principles can be applied in the operating room to decrease the incidence and severity of those injuries, and to avoid downstream sequelae, including the need for surgery."
4,Screening for musculoskeletal problems in children using a questionnaire.,"On April 1, 2016, the Ministerial ordinance was enforced, and musculoskeletal examination of the extremities was made mandatory. From 2008, the University of us started musculoskeletal direct examination. To expand the examination, from 2016, we started to use the marksheet-type questionnaire. This study aimed to report the results of a musculoskeletal examination and investigate the association between musculoskeletal examination and age/gender and reports the reliability of the collected questionnaire data.Direct musculoskeletal examination was performed in K school by 7 orthopedic surgeons. A??marksheet-type screening questionnaire was distributed to all the elementary and junior high school students in Tsukuba and Hitachiomiya cities. The rates of abnormal findings for scoliosis, standing flexion, full squatting with the heels on the floor, general joint laxity, and standing on one leg, torticollis, and flat feet were calculated. We compared the results of the questionnaire and direct examination and calculated sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio.A total of 1844 students in K school had direct examination, and 22,494 questionnaires were able to correct in Tsukuba and Hitachiomiya cities. The rates of abnormal findings in direct examination/questionnaire in scoliosis, standing flexion, full squat, general joint laxity, standing on one leg, torticollis and flat foot were 18.7% (344/1842)/5.1% (1094/21441), 20.2% (372/1841)/26.6% (5817/22078), 6.2% (114/1832)/6.9% (1516/22101), 7.5% (1648/22252), 4.9% (1100/22077), 2.2% (31/1844)/1.2% (272/21687), and 12.5% (231/1842)/8.7% (1785/20871), respectively. Sensitivities of the questionnaire for scoliosis, stand flexion, full squatting, torticollis, and flat feet were 16.8% (53/316), 67.9% (250/368), 48.2% (55/114), 18.9% (7/37), and 32.2% (65/202), respectively.We reported the result of musculoskeletal examination. Accuracy and reliability of this questionnaire were not satisfactory. To perform high quality musculoskeletal examinations, we will aim to increase the quality of screening methods."
4,Musculoskeletal and Rheumatic Diseases Induced by Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Review of the Literature.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a new promising class of antitumor drugs that have been associated with a number of immune-related Adverse Events (AEs), including musculoskeletal and rheumatic disease.We searched Medline reviewing reports of musculoskeletal and rheumatic AEs induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors.Several musculoskeletal and rheumatic AEs associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment are reported in the literature. In particular, arthralgia and myalgia were the most common reported AEs, whereas the prevalence of arthritis, myositis and vasculitis is less characterized and mainly reported in case series and case reports. Other occasionally described AEs are sicca syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, systemic lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis.Newly induced musculoskeletal and rheumatic diseases are a frequent adverse event associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment."
4,Thread embedding acupuncture for musculoskeletal pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.,"Thread embedding acupuncture (TEA) is a special type of acupuncture that inserts certain medical threads (eg, catgut or polydioxanone) into subcutaneous tissue or muscles at specific points. Although TEA has been widely used for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in Korea, China and Taiwan, evidence regarding its efficacy is lacking. The aim of this protocol is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TEA in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain, by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.The following 16 databases will be searched from their inception to 14 May 2017: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, three Chinese database (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database and the Wanfang database) and eight Korean databases (Korean Medical Database, Korean Association of Medical Journal Editors, Korean Studies Information Service System, Korean National Assembly Digital Library, National Digital Science Library, Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System, 'Database Periodical Information Academic and Korean Traditional Knowledge Portal'). The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform will also be searched to retrieve the recently completed studies.All randomised controlled studies in which TEA was used on specific points for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain will be included and no restrictions on language will be applied. The risk of bias of each study will be evaluated by the Cochrane risk of bias tool.Mean difference or standardised mean difference for continuous data and risk ratio for dichotomous data will be calculated with 95% CIs using a random effects model or a fixed effects model. Additional subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted according to a predefined protocol.No ethical issues are predicted. The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference presentation. These findings will summarise the current evidence of TEA for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain and may provide guidance for clinicians and patients to select TEA for musculoskeletal pain.CRD42015019046."
4,Structural equation model of interactions between risk factors and work-related musculoskeletal complaints among Iranian hospital nurses.,"Statistics indicate a high risk of developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders among hospital nurses. The challenge is to understand the associations between musculoskeletal symptoms and various individual and occupational risk factors.This study examined the direct and indirect interactions of various risk factors with musculoskeletal complaints in hospital nurses.In a cross-sectional design, Iranian hospital nurses from Semnan University of Medical Sciences participated in a questionnaire survey reporting their perceived perceptions of various work-related risk factors and musculoskeletal symptoms. We tested our proposed structural equation model to evaluate the relations between latent and observed concepts and the relative importance and strength of exogenous variables in explaining endogenous musculoskeletal complaints.Measurement model fits the data relatively acceptable. Our findings showed direct effects of psychological, role-related and work posture stressors on musculoskeletal complaints. Fatigue mediated the adverse indirect relations of psychological, role-related, work posture and individual factors with musculoskeletal complaints.Structural equation modeling may provide methodological opportunities in occupational health research with a potential to explain the complexity of interactions among risk factors. Prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among nurses must account for physical and psychosocial conditions."
4,Assessing work-related musculoskeletal symptoms among otolaryngology residents.,"Previous studies have suggested that musculoskeletal symptoms are common among practicing otolaryngologists. Early training can be the ideal time to foster knowledge of ergonomics and develop safe work habits, however, little data exists regarding musculoskeletal symptoms in residents. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize musculoskeletal symptoms in a preliminary sample of otolaryngology residents.A cross-sectional survey incorporating the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was sent to 30 Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery residencies to examine musculoskeletal symptoms among residents. A two-sample test of proportions was performed to compare symptoms between male and female residents.In total, 141 respondents (response rate=34.7%) completed the survey. Fifty-five percent of survey respondents were male and 45% were female. Musculoskeletal symptoms were most frequently reported in the neck (82.3%), followed by the lower back (56%), upper back (40.4%), and shoulders (40.4%). The most common symptoms were stiffness in the neck (71.6%), pain in the neck (61.7%), and pain in the lower back (48.2%). In total, 6.4% of residents missed work and 16.3% of residents stopped during an operation at some point due to their symptoms. Most residents (88.3%) believed their musculoskeletal symptoms were attributed to their surgical training. Female residents were significantly more likely to experience neck (p<0.0001) and wrist/hand (p=0.019) discomfort compared to male residents.Musculoskeletal symptoms were common among residents, approaching rates similar to those previously identified in practicing otolaryngologists. Increased emphasis on surgical ergonomics is warranted to improve workplace safety and prevent future injury."
4,Exploring musculoskeletal injuries in the podiatry profession: an international cross sectional study.,"Workplace injury is an international costly burden. Health care workers are an essential component to managing musculoskeletal disorders, however in doing this, they may increase their own susceptibility. While there is substantial evidence about work-related musculoskeletal disorders across the health workforce, understanding risk factors in specific occupational groups, such as podiatry, is limited. The primary aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and intensity of work related low back pain in podiatrists.This was an international cross-sectional survey targeting podiatrists in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The survey had two components; general demographic variables and variables relating to general musculoskeletal pain in general or podiatry work-related musculoskeletal pain. Multivariable regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with musculoskeletal stiffness and pain and low back pain intensity. Thematic analysis was used to group comments podiatrists made about their musculoskeletal health.There were 948 survey responses (5% of Australian, New Zealand and United Kingdom registered podiatrists). There were 719 (76%) podiatrists reporting musculoskeletal pain as a result of their work practices throughout their career. The majority of injuries reported were in the first five years of practice (<i>n</i>?€?=?€?320, 45%). The body area reported as being the location of the most significant injury was the low back (203 of 705 responses, 29%). Being female (<i>p</i>?€?<?€?0.001) and working in private practice (<i>p</i>?€?=?€?0.003) was associated with musculoskeletal pain or stiffness in the past 12??months. There were no variables associated with pain or stiffness in the past four weeks. Being female was the only variable associated with higher pain (<i>p</i>?€?=?€?0.018). There were four main themes to workplace musculoskeletal pain: 1. Organisational and procedural responses to injury, 2. Giving up work, taking time off, reducing hours, 3. Maintaining good musculoskeletal health and 4. Environmental change.The postures that podiatrists hold while treating patients appear to impact on musculoskeletal pain and stiffness. Recently graduated and female podiatrists are at higher risk of injury. There is a need for the profession to consider how they move and take care of their own musculoskeletal health."
4,Sensorimotor Incongruence in People with Musculoskeletal Pain: A Systematic Review.,"Musculoskeletal pain has major public health implications, but the theoretical framework remains unclear. It is hypothesized that sensorimotor incongruence (SMI) might be a cause of long-lasting pain sensations in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Research data about experimental SMI triggering pain has been equivocal, making the relation between SMI and pain elusive. The aim of this study was to systematically review the studies on experimental SMI in people with musculoskeletal pain and healthy individuals.Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines were followed. A systematic literature search was conducted using several databases until January 2015. To identify relevant articles, keywords regarding musculoskeletal pain or healthy subjects and the sensory or the motor system were combined. Study characteristics were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement (CBO) checklist for randomized controlled trials, and level of evidence was judged.Eight cross-over studies met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the studies varied, and populations were heterogeneous. In populations with musculoskeletal pain, outcomes of sensory disturbances and pain were higher during all experimental conditions compared to baseline conditions. In healthy subjects, pain reports during experimental SMI were very low or did not occur at all.Based on the current evidence and despite some methodological issues, there is no evidence that experimental SMI triggers pain in healthy individuals and in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, people with chronic musculoskeletal pain report more sensory disturbances and pain during the experimental conditions, indicating that visual manipulation influences pain outcomes in this population."
4,Musculoskeletal manifestations in pediatric patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus: Developing country perspective.,"Musculoskeletal manifestations in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are responsible for increased morbidity and decreased quality of life. Even in this era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), there are limited studies on different rheumatological manifestations in pediatric patients with HIV, and the spectrum of musculoskeletal manifestation in pediatric HIV is yet to be established.A single-center, prospective, observational study was carried out from October 2014 to September 2016 in a tertiary care hospital of Eastern India with 517 children infected with HIV aged between 3 and 19 years. Particulars of musculoskeletal involvement were at first screened with pediatric gait, arm, leg, spine (pGALS) screening protocol, followed by detailed examination in patients identified through screening. All the participants were re-examined at three and six months of follow-up.Musculoskeletal manifestations were found in 11.2% of the study population. The most common non-infective manifestation found in the study population was arthralgia (5.22%), followed by myalgia (3.29%). The prevalence of definite arthritis was found to be 6/1000 children, whereas infective manifestations (including arthritis, myositis, and osteomyelitis) were found in 2.12% of study population. Musculoskeletal manifestations were commonly found in children infected with HIV who were on anti-retroviral drugs. These manifestations were found commonly in the children in the second decade of their lives. Malnutrition, advanced stage of HIV infection (WHO clinical stage 4), lower CD4 count at the time of evaluation, and longer duration of disease were associated with increased frequency of musculoskeletal manifestations.Musculoskeletal manifestations are frequent in pediatric population infected with HIV. But for better delineation, further multicentric studies are warranted in future in children infected with HIV."
4,The effect of a multifaceted ergonomic intervention program on reducing musculoskeletal disorders in dentists.,"<b>Background:</b> Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are the most common occupational injuries in dentists. These disorders occur due to the specific characteristics of dentistry occupation such as the use of tools and instruments and awkward posture. The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of multifaceted ergonomic program on reducing musculoskeletal disorders in dentists. <b>Methods:</b> One hundred-two male dentists who worked in dentistry clinics of Tehran's hospitals participated in this interventional study. Participants were randomly divided into control (n=50) and intervention (n=52) groups. Dentists in the intervention group (n=52) underwent multifaceted ergonomic intervention program for 8 weeks and dentists in the control group (n=50) only received the measurements. The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders was evaluated in each of the 2 groups at 3 time points before the intervention, 3, and 6 months after the intervention using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ). Paired t-test was used to compare the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders before and after the ergonomic intervention program at the end of 3 and 6 months. <b>Results:</b> The results revealed that the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders was reduced after the intervention in the neck, shoulder, arm, wrist, back, thigh, knees, and feet (p<0.05). On the other hand, the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders increased in the control group in the neck, shoulder, arm, wrist, thigh, and knee, respectively. The survey results revealed that 98% of the participants agreed with this intervention program. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results of this study revealed that the multifaceted ergonomic intervention program, which included improving working conditions, identifying ergonomic risk factors, regular exercise, and discussion group meetings, could decrease the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in dentists."
4,Impact of an 8-Month Trial Using Height-Adjustable Desks on Children's Classroom Sitting Patterns and Markers of Cardio-Metabolic and Musculoskeletal Health.,"During school hours, children can sit for prolonged and unbroken periods of time. This study investigated the impact of an 8-month classroom-based intervention focusing on reducing and breaking-up sitting time on children's cardio-metabolic risk factors (i.e., body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure) and perceptions of musculoskeletal discomfort. Two Year-6 classes (24 students per class) in one primary school were assigned to either an intervention or control classroom. The intervention classroom was equipped with height-adjustable desks and the teacher was instructed in the delivery of pedagogical strategies to reduce and break-up sitting in class. The control classroom followed standard practice using traditional furniture. At baseline, and after 8-months, time spent sitting, standing, stepping, and sitting-bouts (occasions of continuous sitting) as well as the frequency of sit-to-stand transitions were obtained from activPAL inclinometers and the time spent in light-intensity physical activity was obtained from ActiGraph accelerometers. Demographics and musculoskeletal characteristics were obtained from a self-report survey. Hierarchical linear mixed models found that during class-time, children's overall time spent sitting in long bouts (>10 min) were lower and the number of sit-to-stand transitions were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group, while no changes were observed for musculoskeletal pain/discomfort. No significant intervention effects were found for the anthropometrics measures and blood pressure. Height-adjustable desks and pedagogical strategies to reduce/break-up sitting can positively modify classroom sitting patterns in children. Longer interventions, larger and varied sample size may be needed to show health impacts; however, these desks did not increase musculoskeletal pain/discomfort."
4,Musculoskeletal impact of the use of various types of electronic devices on university students in Hong Kong: An evaluation by means of self-reported questionnaire.,"Despite the increasingly widespread popularity of electronic devices, there are limited comprehensive studies on the effects of usage and exposure to multiple electronic devices over extended periods of time. Therefore, this study explored the cumulative musculoskeletal implications of exposure to various electronic devices among university students.A self-reported questionnaire was administered in the university in Hong Kong and students provided information about the frequency and duration of electronic devices use, including computers, mobile phones and game consoles, and reported on any musculoskeletal pain or discomfort that may relate to electronic devices usage in the immediate 12 months prior to the survey date.A total of 503 university students (59% males and 41% females) aged 18-25 years completed the questionnaire. The results showed that 251 (49.9%) respondents reported upper limb musculoskeletal symptoms, particularly in the neck and shoulder regions. Among these, 155 (61.8%) indicated that their discomfort was related to electronic device usage. Statistically significant differences in exposure to electronic devices and musculoskeletal outcomes between genders were found (p??<??0.05).The use of electronic devices and habitual postures were associated with musculoskeletal problems among university students in Hong Kong. This phenomenon highlights the urgent need for ergonomics education and recommendations to increase students' awareness of musculoskeletal wellbeing."
4,Musculoskeletal Disorders in Ophthalmologists After Simulated Cataract Operation: A Pilot Study.,"Musculoskeletal disorders are a common problem among ophthalmologists, likely due to ergonomic challenges. Most research on the topic has been survey-based studies, which carry inherent weaknesses.To examine the frequency and pattern of musculoskeletal dysfunction induced by performing a surgical procedure and to quantify the improvement after ergonomic interventions.Ophthalmology residents from a single academic institution were invited to participate in the study on a volunteer basis. Preexisting musculoskeletal disorders; previous spinal, cervical, or shoulder surgery; or limited range of motion of the upper body or arms were exclusion criteria. The interventions consisted of a surgical simulation session and a control session, each lasting 2 hours. For the surgical simulation session, a musculoskeletal examination was performed at the beginning and end of the 2-hour session after the participants used the Eyesi Cataract Surgery Simulator (VRmagic). A musculoskeletal examination was performed by the palpatory screener (M.A.Z.) at the beginning and conclusion of the 2-hour control session, which consisted of both passive and active tasks. The musculoskeletal screener was blinded as to which session the participant was completing at the time of the examinations, as well as any musculoskeletal examination findings from before the intervention. All participants completed both sessions, but they were randomized into which session they were to complete first. Participants completed each session one after the other.Eight participants completed both sessions, and 32 musculoskeletal examinations were performed. In the surgical simulation session, after using the simulator, 5 of 8 participants had an increase in the number of spinal levels with tissue texture abnormalities, and 3 had no change. Of those in the control session, 5 participants had a decrease in the number of spinal levels with tissue texture abnormalities after a period of rest. Three participants in the control session had an increase in the number of affected spinal levels. The mean (SD) change in number of affected spinal levels in the surgical simulation session and control session was 1.3 (1.2) and -0.6 (2.0), respectively (P=.125). Age, sex, level of training, baseline somatic dysfunction, and which session was completed first did not affect results.The majority of participants in the surgical simulation session had an increase in degree of somatic dysfunction, whereas the majority in the control session had a decrease in degree of somatic dysfunction. Although the sample size of this pilot study was too small to show statistical significance, a trend was observed, and further study is warranted."
4,Should exercises be painful in the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Chronic musculoskeletal disorders are a prevalent and costly global health issue. A new form of exercise therapy focused on loading and resistance programmes that temporarily aggravates a patient's pain has been proposed. The object of this review was to compare the effect of exercises where pain is allowed/encouraged compared with non-painful exercises on pain, function or disability in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain within randomised controlled trials.Two authors independently selected studies and appraised risk of bias. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment system was used to evaluate the quality of evidence.The literature search identified 9081 potentially eligible studies. Nine papers (from seven trials) with 385 participants met the inclusion criteria. There was short- term significant difference in pain, with moderate quality evidence for a small effect size of -0.27 (-0.54 to -0.05) in favour of painful exercises. For pain in the medium and long term, and function and disability in the short, medium and long term, there was no significant difference.Protocols using painful exercises offer a small but significant benefit over pain-free exercises in the short term, with moderate quality of evidence. In the medium and long term there is no clear superiority of one treatment over another. Pain during therapeutic exercise for chronic musculoskeletal pain need not be a barrier to successful outcomes. Further research is warranted to fully evaluate the effectiveness of loading and resistance programmes into pain for chronic musculoskeletal disorders.CRD42016038882."
4,The effect of magnification lenses on reducing musculoskeletal discomfort among dentists.,"<b>Background:</b> Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are the most important problems in the health workforce. These discomforts cause many working days losses, increase absenteeism from work, and impose annual economic costs. Awkward posture is the most important factor among the risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This study aimed at implementing an interventional ergonomic program to minimize musculoskeletal disorder among dentists. <b>Methods:</b> This semi- experimental study was conducted on 75 dentists of Milad hospital using a census method. The Nordic Questionnaire was used to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. In this study, the intervention was to apply optical magnification lens whose impact on reducing musculoskeletal disorder had been previously investigated. Corlett and Bishop Scale was used to evaluate musculoskeletal disorders before and after the intervention. Paired t-test was conducted to compare the discomfort intensity before and after the intervention. <b>Results:</b> The results revealed that the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in neck, back, shoulder, and arm were higher than other areas of the body in dentists. There was a significant difference in discomfort intensity of the neck, shoulder, arm, back, elbow, forearm, and the whole body after the ergonomic intervention (p<0.05). Surveys on improving working conditions using the magnification lens revealed that more than 89% of the individuals expressed that the use of the lens increased the ease while working. <b>Conclusion:</b> The present study revealed that the use of optical magnification loupes, because of providing a suitable posture while working, could reduce musculoskeletal disorders in different areas of the body. Thus, we can predict that the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders will be reduced in dentists in a long run if they use optical magnification loupes."
4,"Ergonomic risk factors and musculoskeletal symptoms in surgeons with three types of surgery: Open, laparoscopic, and microsurgery.","<b>Background:</b> Musculoskeletal symptoms are the main cause of loss of working time, and increase in labor costs. Poor posture is the most important risk factor for work-related musculoskeletal symptoms. This study aimed at evaluating the role of ergonomic risk factors in different surgical (open surgery, laparoscopy, and microsurgery) in the frequency or resonance frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms. <b>Methods:</b> This descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 81 surgeons in a hospital in Tehran. In this study, the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms was evaluated using the Nordic Questionnaire. Moreover, Workplace ergonomic risk assessment method (WERA) was used to evaluate ergonomic risk factors in 3 types of open surgery, laparoscopy, and microsurgery. <b>Results:</b> The results revealed that the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms of the neck, back, shoulder, and arm is high in surgeons (over 75%). The mean final score of WERA was 40.11, representing the high risk of the 3 types of surgery for the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms. Results revealed that the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the neck, waist and wrists had a significant relationship with the body posture in the 3 types of open surgery, laparoscopy, and microsurgery (p<0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> In the present study, the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms was high in the neck, waist, and hands surgeries. Depending on the type of surgery, teaching correct working methods, using proper seats and ergonomic equipment are the best strategies to reduce musculoskeletal symptoms in the surgical profession."
4,Use of the Omaha System to identify musculoskeletal problems in intensive care unit nurses: a case study.,"there is a need for a standard terminology to identify and manage occupational risks in intensive care unit (ICU) settings.this study was conducted to investigate the occupational musculoskeletal symptom-related problems of one ICU nurse using the Omaha system.a case study method was employed. An Evaluation of Knowledge form and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment tools were used to identify musculoskeletal symptoms and ergonomic risks. Three components of the Omaha System were used: Problem Classification Scheme, Intervention Scheme and Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes.eight signs/symptoms related to four problems were identified from three domains: environmental (neighbourhood/workplace safety), physiological (pain and neuro-musculoskeletal function), and health-related behaviours (physical activity and healthcare supervision). Interventions were mapped to Omaha System terms, and nursing outcomes were evaluated.this study presented an example of using the Omaha System in occupational health nursing practice. The Omaha System can be used effectively to identify musculoskeletal problems and related factors of ICU nurses in a standardised and computerised concept. Use of this system could aid prevention of occupational musculoskeletal problems in ICU nurses."
4,Cervical musculoskeletal dysfunction in headache: How should it be defined?,"Neck pain commonly accompanies migraine and tension-type headache, but the literature is divided on whether this neck pain is a headache symptom or is associated with cervical musculoskeletal dysfunction. Clarification is essential for hypotheses on the pathogenesis of these headaches and their variants and for decisions on suitability of local neck treatments, both from research and clinical practice perspectives. Reasons for disparate findings could relate to participant selection in headache studies and/or the bases on which decisions on the presence of cervical musculoskeletal dysfunction are reached. Propositions towards gaining a clearer picture of migraine and tension-type headache related neck pain include first, stricter inclusion criteria and reporting of headache characteristics of study participants. Second, reliance on pain sensitivity or the presence of neck tenderness/trigger points as measures be discarded, as they are not uniquely tied to a musculoskeletal disorder. Instead, place reliance on tests of musculoskeletal (dys)function. Third, the values and interpretation of single measures or tests of impairment/dysfunctions can be non-informative and do not reflect the presentation of cervical musculoskeletal disorders. Rather, a typical presentation includes at a fundamental level, interrelated changes in cervical movement, segmental joint and muscle function. We advocate that these measures be adopted as the core set of related measures to define cervical musculoskeletal dysfunction in headache. This does not deter inclusion of other measures of interest or qualification."
4,Changing Musculoskeletal Extremity Imaging Utilization From 1994 Through 2013: A Medicare Beneficiary Perspective.,"The objective of our study was to assess temporal changes in the utilization of musculoskeletal extremity imaging in Medicare beneficiaries over a recent 20-year period (1994-2013).Medicare Physician Supplier Procedure Summary Master Files from 1994 through 2013 were used to study changing utilization and utilization rates of the four most common musculoskeletal imaging modalities: radiography, MRI, CT, and ultrasound.Utilization rates (per 1000 beneficiaries) for all four musculoskeletal extremity imaging modalities increased over time: 43% (from 441.7 to 633.6) for radiography, 615% (5.4-38.6) for MRI, 758% (1.2-10.3) for CT, and 500% (1.8-10.8) for ultrasound. Radiologists were the most common billing specialty group for all modalities throughout the 20-year period, maintaining dominant market shares for MRI and CT (84% and 96% in 2013). In recent years, the second most common billing group was orthopedic surgery for radiography, MRI, and CT and podiatry for ultrasound. The physician office was the most common site of service for radiography, MRI, and ultrasound, whereas the hospital outpatient and inpatient settings were the most common sites for CT.In the Medicare population, the most common musculoskeletal extremity imaging modalities increased substantially in utilization over the 2-decade period from 1994 through 2013. Throughout that time, radiology remained the most common billing specialty, and the physician office and hospital outpatient settings remained the most common sites of service. These insights may have implications for radiology practice leaders in making decisions regarding capital infrastructure, workforce, and training investments to ensure the provision of optimal imaging services for extremity musculoskeletal care."
4,Are persons with fibromyalgia or other musculoskeletal pain more likely to report hearing loss? A HUNT study.,"Leading theories about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia focus on central nervous dysregulation or sensitization, which can cause altered perception. There is growing evidence that fibromyalgia involves altered perception not only of pain, but also other sensory stimuli. On this basis, we investigated whether individuals with fibromyalgia are more likely to report subjective loss of hearing, adjusted for audiometrically measured loss of hearing, compared to persons without any musculoskeletal pain disorders. In addition, we studied persons with other musculoskeletal pain than fibromyalgia and persons who did not have any musculoskeletal pain.The study includes 44 494 persons from the second health survey in Nord-Tr??ndelag (HUNT2) who had undergone audiometry and answered a comprehensive questionnaire that mapped fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal pain at various sites and subjective hearing loss. Respondents with other musculoskeletal pain problems than fibromyalgia were divided into two groups with respectively localized and widespread musculoskeletal pain. Data were analyzed with logistic regression models adjusting for age, education, anxiety, depression and hearing thresholds.In adjusted analysis, individuals with fibromyalgia had increased likelihood to report subjective hearing loss, compared to persons without fibromyalgia or other musculoskeletal pain (OR 4.578, 95% CI 3.622-5.787 and OR 4.523, 95% CI 3.077-6.647 in women and men). Furthermore, people with local and widespread musculoskeletal pain not diagnosed with fibromyalgia, also had increased likelihood to report subjective hearing loss, compared to people with no musculoskeletal pain. This relationship was greater for widespread pain than for localized pain (OR 1.915, 95% CI 1.627-2.255, and 1.796, 95% CI 1.590-2.029, in women and men with local musculoskeletal pain and OR 3.073, 95% CI 2.668-3.539, OR 3.618, 95% CI 3.225-4.058, in women and men with widespread pain, respectively).Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that fibromyalgia is related to a general dysregulation of the central nervous system. The same might also be the case for other local and, in particular, other widespread, musculoskeletal pain."
4,Occupational stress and musculoskeletal symptoms in firefighters.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential association between occupational stress and musculoskeletal symptoms in firefighters.Data were collected among Cypriot firefighters through a battery of adapted questionnaires completed anonymously.A total of 430 firefighters (a response rate of 68%) completed the survey (the age range: 21-60 years). A total of 11% of firefighters reported moderate to extremely severe stress through the <i>Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire</i> and <i>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale</i>. A total of 40% of firefighters reported musculoskeletal symptoms, the most frequent being back pain. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models showed that occupational stress was associated with a 50% higher risk of musculoskeletal symptoms in firefighters after adjusting for age, smoking and obesity (OR = 1.52, p = 0.04). In addition, a positive dose-response relationship was found between occupational stress and musculoskeletal symptoms.Occupational stress constitutes a significant risk for firefighters and is associated with higher prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms at work."
4,[Prevention of the musculoskeletal system's dysfunction based on the example of <i>Prevention program of spinal pain syndrome in nursing staff</i>].,"Most of the medical activities, which are work-related, both static and dynamic are performed by nurses in a forced position. Excessive and improper strain of the musculoskeletal system, especially when lifting and moving patients, is the cause of many injuries of the musculoskeletal system. The work presents the implementation and evaluation of the program concerning the prevention of dysfunction on the part of the musculoskeletal system, addressed to professionally active nurses.The questionnaire was addressed to 125 professionally active nurses, working in conservative units (92%) and outpatient care (8%), suffering from musculoskeletal system dysfunctions, qualifying for the preventive program (ultimately 65 respondents joined the program). The research method was a diagnostic survey, using: the <i>World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF</i> (WHOQOL-BREF) (scale results are in the range of 4-20 pts), 5-point scale to assess the frequency and intensity of pain and body mass index (BMI).The average age of the studied group is 46.6 years old (??8.6), work experience 24.3 (??9.8). A total of 57% of respondents reported pain in the musculoskeletal system, the vast majority of which affected the lumbar spine (89.2%). Constantly occurring complaints were characteristic for nurses, whose average age was 49.5 years (p = 0.0001) and with work experience over 27 years (p = 0.0002), with a BMI value (??? 25) (p = 0.0038). The average quality of life results were significantly dependent on the intensity of pain (p < 0.05).The research shows that pain, escalating with age and duration of the professional activity is a significant factor in lowering the quality of nurses' life. The severity and frequency of experienced ailments significantly decreased after participating in kinesitherapeutic activities. Med Pr. 2019;70(2)."
4,Ultrasound in the assessment of musculoskeletal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus: state of the art and perspectives.,"Musculoskeletal manifestations are extremely common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Transient and migratory arthralgia is frequently reported even without clinical signs of joint or tendon inflammation. In less than 15% of patients, joints may be more severely affected by deforming (Jaccoud's arthropathy) and/or erosive arthropathy (Rhupus syndrome). In recent years, ultrasound has emerged as a promising imaging technique for the assessment of musculoskeletal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus, having demonstrated the ability to detect inflammation and structural damage both at articular and periarticular level. Recent ultrasound studies have also revealed new insights into musculoskeletal involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, some of them questioning the traditional concepts of systemic lupus erythematosus arthropathy, with potential clinical, prognostic and therapeutic implications. In daily clinical practice, the use of ultrasound in the assessment of joint and tendon involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is still limited. Several methodological issues encountered in ultrasound studies evaluating musculoskeletal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus patients need to be addressed in order to improve both the reliability and clinical usefulness of ultrasound findings. This paper reviews ultrasound studies assessing musculoskeletal involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting certainty, limits, potential applications and future perspectives of ultrasound use in systemic lupus erythematosus patients."
4,Musculoskeletal extremity pain in Danish school children - how often and for how long? The CHAMPS study-DK.,"Musculoskeletal pain is common in childhood and adolescence, and may be long-lasting and recurrent. Musculoskeletal problems tend to follow adolescents into adulthood, and therefore it is important to design better prevention strategies and early effective treatment. To this end, we need in-depth knowledge about the epidemiology of musculoskeletal extremity problems in this age group, and therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, frequency and course of musculoskeletal pain in the upper and lower extremities in a cohort of Danish school children aged 8-14??years at baseline.This was a prospective 3-year school-based cohort study, with information about musculoskeletal pain collected in two ways. Parents answered weekly mobile phone text messages about the presence or absence of musculoskeletal pain in their children, and a clinical consultation was performed in a subset of the children.We found that approximately half the children had lower extremity pain every study year. This pain lasted on average for 8??weeks out of a study year, and the children had on average two and a half episodes per study year. Approximately one quarter of the children had upper extremity pain every study year that lasted on average 3??weeks during a study year, with one and a half episodes being the average. In general, there were more non-traumatic pain episodes compared with traumatic episodes in the lower extremities, whereas the opposite was true in the upper extremities. The most common anatomical pain sites were 'knee' and 'ankle/ft'.Lower extremity pain among children and adolescents is common, recurrent and most often of non-traumatic origin. Upper extremity pain is less common, with fewer and shorter episodes, and usually with a traumatic onset. Girls more frequently reported upper extremity pain, whereas there was no sex-related difference in the lower extremities. The most frequently reported locations were 'knee' and 'ankle/ft'."
4,Prevalence of Musculoskeletal Symptoms Among Brazilian Merchant Navy Cadets: Differences Between Sexes and School Years.,"Musculoskeletal disorders are common among military personnel, especially during the initial basic training period. Prior studies have reported the prevalence rate of overall musculoskeletal symptoms or injuries in different military population and nationalities, especially from North America and Europe; however, very limited information regarding the military population of South America exists. Although Brazil has one of the biggest military forces worldwide (???335,000 military personnel), currently, to our knowledge, there is no study reporting musculoskeletal symptoms or injury statistics in the Brazilian Armed Forces. Thus, the aims of this study were to describe the 12-month prevalence rate of self-reported musculoskeletal symptoms in cadets and to compare this prevalence rate between sexes and school years.We conducted a cross-sectional study that took place from January to March 2016. Participants were Navy cadets, of both sexes and from three different school years of a Brazilian Merchant Navy Academy. All volunteers completed an adapted version of the Brazilian Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire that assessed the past 12-month prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms over eight body regions of the trunk and lower extremity. The Pearson's ??<sup>2</sup> test was conducted to compare prevalence of symptoms per body region between sexes and among the 3 school years. The study has been approved by the Naval Hospital's ethical committee.A total of 545 cadets (394 males), corresponding to 79% of all 688 cadets enrolled at the Merchant Navy Academy, volunteered to participate on this study. Among all cadets, 266 (49%) reported symptoms in at least one body region in the past 12-months. The knee with 116 (21%) and lower back with 96 (18%), were the most prevalent regions. In terms of sex differences, there was higher prevalence of symptoms among females 90 (60%) than males 176 (45%). Furthermore, females reported almost double the prevalence for lower back symptoms (27% vs. 14%, p = 0.001) and 11% higher prevalence of knee symptoms (29% vs. 18%, p = 0.006) than males. Finally, it is important to highlight that cadets from the second (127 [65%]) and third (77 [55%]) school years had higher prevalence of symptoms than cadets from the first year (62 [29%]). The knee and lower back were consistently the two most prevalent regions among all school years, but shin symptoms increased from 3% to 17% (p < 0.001) between the first and second school years.The prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the Brazilian Merchant Navy Academy doubles between initial enrollment and the beginning of the second school year. Females have consistently higher rates of symptoms than males, particularly reporting higher prevalence of knee and lower back pain which are the two most prevalent regions in this population. Prevention efforts should concentrate on the basic training period in an attempt to decrease the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in this population. Finally, prospective studies are required to verify the cause and effect relationship between training and musculoskeletal symptoms."
3,Prevalence of neoplasms in patients with acromegaly - the need for a national registry.,"Acromegaly is an endocrine disorder caused predominantly by pituitary adenoma leading to autonomic oversecretion of growth hormone and secondary elevation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Consequently, there are both theoretical and experimental grounds for establishing a correlation between this disorder and the higher incidence of neoplasms.The aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence and types of neoplasms among patients with acromegaly.The study included 67 patients with acromegaly, aged between 24 and 75??18.8 years, 46 women (68.7%) and 21 men (31.3%), BMI: 30.7??5.7 kg/m2, age at diagnosis 49.1??12.5 years, with the medians of GH and IGF-1 levels at diagnosis of 11.3 ng/ml and 663.8 ng/ml, respectively. A retrospective analysis of medical records with particular regard to physical examination, medical history, laboratory and imaging tests was performed.Fifty-one patients (76.1%) suffered from at least one neoplasm, among whom 48 patients (71.6%) had benign proliferations, whereas malignant neoplasms (larynx, endometrial and colon cancers) were found in only three patients (4.5%).Benign neoplasms were found in majority of patients with acromegaly (71.6%) most notably: nodular goiter and colon polyps; malignant lesions were rare (4.5%). Only every fifth patient suffered from no neoplastic proliferations. No correlations between the studied parameters and the incidence of neoplasms were found, most likely due to the small number of patients. This is the reason for proposing the creating of the first national register of incidences of neoplasms among acromegalic patients."
3,[Epidemiology of microsatellite instability across solid neoplasms].,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, regardless of the tumor type. While clinical characteristics of MSI cancer patients have been largely described in tumor localizations frequently associated with this genetic phenotype (i.e. colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer), it remains poorly characterized in other neoplasms. Pan-tumor high-throughput genome sequence analyses have contributed to the broadening of knowledge about the landscape of MSI. This review aims at synthetizing the literature concerning the frequency of MSI status in solid cancers, according to the cancer stage and the hereditary or sporadic origin of the mismatch repair deficiency. We then check for other cancers frequently associated with MSI and describe the clinical and pathological characteristics that should suggest a MSI phenotype."
3,A retrospective audit on usage of Diatrizoate Meglumine (Gastrografin<sup>??</sup>) for intestinal obstruction or constipation in patients with advanced neoplasms.,"Intestinal obstruction and constipation are common conditions in patients with advanced neoplasms. Diatrizoate Meglumine has been used in the management of both these conditions without good quality evidence of its effectiveness and safety.This audit aimed to assess the usage, effectiveness and adverse effects of Diatrizoate Meglumine for intestinal obstruction and constipation in patients with advanced neoplasms.A retrospective chart review was undertaken. Descriptive statistics were utilised.All patients with known advanced neoplasms admitted to Mater Health Services and St Vincent's Private Hospital Brisbane between January 2013 and October 2015; who were administered Diatrizoate Meglumine were included.Seventy-one patients received Diatrizoate Meglumine. The most common diagnoses were ovarian or primary peritoneal neoplasms (33.8%). Diatrizoate Meglumine was most commonly used for intestinal obstruction (59.2%). The median dose used per patient episode was 50?€?mL (range: 15-500?€?mL). Thirty-two patients (45%) had imaging 4-24?€?h post-dose with Diatrizoate Meglumine being present in the large intestine in 75% of these images. Intestinal obstruction or constipation resolved in 90% of patients post-dose.Most clinicians used 50?€?mL of Diatrizoate Meglumine as a single dose and repeated imaging after 4-24?€?h. Diatrizoate Meglumine was well tolerated and may be effective in resolving intestinal obstruction and constipation in patients with advanced neoplasms. Quality controlled studies are needed to further guide the use of Diatrizoate Meglumine in intestinal obstruction and constipation in patients with advanced neoplasms."
3,Neoplasms Reported With Liraglutide or Placebo in People With Type 2 Diabetes: Results From the LEADER Randomized Trial.,"This study explored neoplasm risk with liraglutide versus placebo in the LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results) cohort.LEADER (NCT01179048) was an international, phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Participants aged ???50 years with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk were assigned 1:1 to receive liraglutide (???1.8 mg daily; <i>n</i> = 4,668) or placebo (<i>n</i> = 4,672) in addition to standard care and monitored for 3.5-5 years (median follow-up 3.8 years). The occurrence of neoplasms was a prespecified, exploratory secondary end point. Post hoc analyses of the time to the first confirmed neoplasms were conducted using a Cox regression model.Neoplasm was confirmed in 10.1% of patients with liraglutide versus 9.0% with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12 [95% CI 0.99; 1.28]). The HR (95% CI) for liraglutide versus placebo was 1.06 (0.90; 1.25) for malignant neoplasms and 1.16 (0.93; 1.44) for benign neoplasms. Sensitivity analyses excluding neoplasms occurring <1 year or <2 years after randomization and analyses by sex provided similar results. In our main analyses, the 95% CI for the HR included one for all malignant neoplasms evaluated (including pancreatic and thyroid neoplasms) except for prostate neoplasms, which occurred in fewer liraglutide-treated patients.LEADER was not primarily designed to assess neoplasm risk. Firm conclusions cannot be made regarding numeric imbalances observed for individual neoplasm types (e.g., pancreatic cancer) that occurred infrequently. LEADER data do, however, exclude a major increase in the risk of total malignant neoplasms with liraglutide versus placebo. Additional studies are needed to assess longer-term exposure."
3,Development of neoplasms in pediatric patients with rheumatic disease exposed to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies: a single Centre retrospective study.,"Anti-TNF (Tumor necrosis factor) therapy is effective in treating pediatric patients with refractory rheumatic disease. There is however a concern that anti-TNF usage may increase the risk of malignancy. Reports on specific types of malignancy in this patient population have been emerging over the past decade, but there is a need for additional malignancy reports, as these events are rare. Therefore, a retrospective chart review was performed on the biologic database of pediatric rheumatology patients at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) from 1997 to 2013 for neoplasms, patient demographic information and rheumatologic treatment course.6/357 (1.68%) rheumatology patients treated with anti-TNF therapy between 1997 and 2013 developed neoplasms. One patient had two malignancies. One patient had a benign neoplasm. Cases were exposed to etanercept, infliximab or both. Neoplasms developed late after anti-TNF exposure (median 5.0??years) and infliximab treatment was associated with a shorter time to malignancy. The neoplasms identified were as follows: 2 renal clear cell carcinoma, 1 pilomatricoma, 1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 1 Ewing's sarcoma, 1 hepatic T-cell lymphoma, 1 lymphoproliferative disease.The malignancy rate at our centre is low, however more than half of the neoplasms identified were rare and unusual in the pediatric population. The 5-year malignancy-free probability for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with biologic therapy was 97% from our database. Long-term screening for rare neoplasms is important as part of the safety monitoring for any pediatric rheumatology patient receiving anti-TNF therapy."
3,Application of MRI for the Diagnosis of Neoplasms.,"The aim of the study was to determine the most commonly diagnosed neoplasms in the MRI scanned patient population and indicate correlations based on the descriptive variables.The SPSS software was used to determine the incidence of neoplasms within the specific diagnoses based on the descriptive variables of the studied population. Over a five year period, 791 patients and 839 MRI scans were identified in neoplasm category (C00-D48 according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10).More women (56%) than men (44%) represented C00-D48. Three categories of neoplasms were recorded. Furthermore, benign neoplasms were the most numerous, diagnosed mainly in patients in the fifth decade of life, and included benign neoplasms of the brain and other parts of the central nervous system.Males ??? 30 years of age with neoplasms had three times higher MRI scans rate than females of the same age group; even though females had much higher scans rate in every other category. The young males are more often selected for these scans if a neoplasm is suspected. Finally, the number of MRI-diagnosed neoplasms showed a linear annual increase."
3,Use of 5-azacitidine for therapy-related myeloid neoplasms in patients with concomitant active neoplastic disease.,"Patients diagnosed with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (TRMN) with concomitant active neoplastic disorder (CAND) are usually proposed for best supportive care (BSC). We evaluated the feasibility of using 5-azacytidine (AZA) in this setting.All patients referred to Gustave Roussy between 2010 and 2015 for TRMN diagnosis (less than 30% blast) and eligible for AZA treatment were included. Patients with CAND proposed for BSC were also described. Patient's outcomes were analyzed based on the presence or not of a CAND.Fifty-two patients with TRMN were analyzed, including 19 patients with CAND (14 eligible for AZA) and 33 without CAND eligible for AZA. The 5 patients with CAND ineligible for AZA had a worst performance status (p=0.016) at diagnosis and a shorter overall survival (OS) (0.62 months). Baseline characteristics of patients eligible for AZA were similar in the 2 groups except a trend for best performance status in patients with CAND (p=0.06). Overall response rate (71.4% vs 60.3%), transfusion independence (50.0% vs 45.5%) and OS (12.7 months vs 10.8 months) were similar between patients with and without CAND respectively (p=ns).Here we report the feasibility and efficacy of AZA for selected patients with TRMN and a CAND."
3,Radiologic Evaluation of Clinically Benign Rectal Neoplasms May Not Be Necessary Before Local Excision.,"Local excision may be curative for benign and malignant rectal neoplasms. Because many early rectal cancers are discovered incidentally after local excision of clinically benign lesions, it is unclear whether preoperative imaging with transrectal ultrasound or MRI affects management.The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic characteristics and effect of preoperative imaging on the incidence of malignancy in benign rectal lesions undergoing local excision.Prospective data from 2 institutions were included. Coarsened exact matching created a balanced cohort comparing imaging and no-imaging groups.The study was conducted at high-volume specialist referral hospitals.Adult patients undergoing local excision via transanal endoscopic surgery between 1997 and 2016 for clinically benign rectal neoplasms were included.The study intervention included preoperative imaging with transrectal ultrasound and/or MRI.We measured the incidence of malignancy and diagnostic accuracy of preoperative imaging.A total of 620 patients were included (272 with preoperative imaging and 348 without). There were 250 patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound, and 24 patients undergoing MRI (2 patients underwent both). Transrectal ultrasound and MRI correctly identified malignant polyps in 50% (11/22) and 44% (8/18). Overall agreement for benign versus malignant polyps between preoperative imaging and final pathology was ?? = 0.30 (95% CI, 0.18-0.41) for transrectal ultrasound and 0.29 (95% CI, 0.01-0.57) for MRI. In both the overall and unmatched cohorts, the incidence of malignancy, margin involvement, and proportion of patients requiring salvage surgery was similar.Data were obtained from 2 institutions with different equipment over a long time period.Preoperative imaging did not accurately identify malignancy in clinically benign rectal lesions and did not affect the incidence of malignancy, margin involvement, or proportion of patients requiring salvage surgery. Therefore, preoperative imaging may not be necessary for clinically benign lesions undergoing local excision. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A695."
3,Fertility treatments and pediatric neoplasms of the offspring: results of a population-based cohort with a??median follow-up of 10 years.,"Studies have questioned the long-term health effects of offspring conceived after fertility treatments.We aimed to evaluate whether an association exists between mode of conception (in??vitro fertilization, ovulation induction, or spontaneous pregnancy) and neoplasm risk (both benign and malignant tumors) among the offspring; we observed the offspring for up to 18 years.A population-based cohort analysis was performed that compared the risk for neoplasms among children (up to the age of 18 years) based on mode of conception. Neoplasm diagnoses were based on hospital records of the same single tertiary center in the region. All singletons born during from 1991-2013 and discharged alive were included in the study. Offspring with congenital malformations were excluded from the analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to compare cumulative neoplasms incidence; multivariable survival analyses were used to control for confounders that included gestational age, pregnancy complications, and maternal factors.During the study period, 242,187 newborn infants met the inclusion criteria: 2603 (1.1%) were conceived after in??vitro fertilization; 1721 (0.7%) were conceived after ovulation induction treatments, and 237,863 (98.3%) were conceived spontaneously. During the follow-up period (median, 10.55 years), 1498 neoplasms(0.6%) were diagnosed. Incidence density rate for neoplasms was higher among children conceived either after in??vitro fertilization (1.5/1000 person years) or ovulation induction treatments (1.0/1000 person years), as compared with naturally conceived children (0.59/1000 person years; Kaplan-Meier log??rank, P<.001). The association between in??vitro fertilization and total pediatric neoplasms and the association between any fertility treatments and malignancies remained significant; we controlled for confounders such as gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders, preterm birth, and maternal age (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.71-3.50; and adjusted hazard ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-3.36, for all neoplasms and all malignancies, respectively).Children conceived after fertility treatments are at an increased risk for pediatric neoplasms."
3,Preleukaemic clonal haemopoiesis and risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms: a case-control study.,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms are secondary malignancies that are often fatal, but their risk factors are not well understood. Evidence suggests that individuals with clonal haemopoiesis have increased risk of developing haematological malignancies. We aimed to identify whether patients with cancer who have clonal haemopoiesis are at an increased risk of developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms.We did this retrospective case-control study to compare the prevalence of clonal haemopoiesis between patients treated for cancer who later developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (cases) and patients who did not develop these neoplasms (controls). All patients in both case and control groups were treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) from 1997 to 2015. We used the institutional medical database to locate these patients. Patients were included as cases if they were treated for a primary cancer, subsequently developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, and had available paired samples of bone marrow from the time of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm diagnosis and peripheral blood from the time of primary cancer diagnosis. Patients were eligible for inclusion as age-matched controls if they were treated for lymphoma, received combination chemotherapy, and did not develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after at least 5 years of follow-up. We used molecular barcode sequencing of 32 genes on the pretreatment peripheral blood samples to detect clonal haemopoiesis. For cases, we also used targeted gene sequencing on bone marrow samples and investigated clonal evolution from clonal haemopoiesis to the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. To further clarify the association between clonal haemopoiesis and therapy-related myeloid neoplasm development, we also analysed the prevalence of clonal haemopoiesis in an external cohort of patients with lymphoma who were treated in a randomised trial of front-line chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, with or without melatonin. This trial was done at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1999 and 2001 (protocol number 98-009).We identified 14 cases and 54 controls. Of the 14 cases, we detected clonal haemopoiesis in the peripheral blood samples of ten (71%) patients. We detected clonal haemopoiesis in 17 (31%) of the 54 controls. The cumulative incidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms in both cases and controls at 5 years was significantly higher in patients with clonal haemopoiesis (30%, 95% CI 16-51) than in those without (7%, 2-21; p=0??016). In the external cohort, five (7%) of 74 patients developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, of whom four (80%) had clonal haemopoiesis; 11 (16%) of 69 patients who did not develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms had clonal haemopoiesis. In the external cohort, the cumulative incidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms at 10 years was significantly higher in patients with clonal haemopoiesis (29%, 95% CI 8-53) than in those without (0%, 0-0; p=0??0009). In a multivariate Fine and Gray model based on the external cohort, the presence of clonal haemopoiesis significantly increased the risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm development (hazard ratio 13??7, 95% CI 1??7-108??7; p=0??013).Preleukaemic clonal haemopoiesis is common in patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms at the time of their primary cancer diagnosis and before they have been exposed to treatment. Our results suggest that clonal haemopoiesis could be used as a predictive marker to identify patients with cancer who are at risk of developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. A prospective trial to validate this concept is warranted.Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas, Red and Charline McCombs Institute for the Early Detection and Treatment of Cancer, NIH through MD Anderson Cancer Center Support Grant, and the MD Anderson MDS & AML Moon Shots Program."
3,Unique and Novel Urinary Metabolomic Features in Malignant versus Benign Adrenal Neoplasms.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Adrenal incidentalomas must be differentiated from adrenocortical cancer (ACC). Currently, size, growth, and imaging characteristics determine the potential for malignancy but are imperfect. The aim was to evaluate whether urinary small molecules (<800 Da) are associated with ACC.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Preoperative fasting urine specimens from patients with ACC (<i>n</i> = 19) and benign adrenal tumors (<i>n</i> = 46) were analyzed by unbiased ultraperformance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Creatinine-normalized features were analyzed by Progenesis, SIMCA, and unpaired <i>t</i> test adjusted by FDR. Features with an AUC >0.8 were identified through fragmentation patterns and database searches. All lead features were assessed in an independent set from patients with ACC (<i>n</i> = 11) and benign adrenal tumors (<i>n</i> = 46) and in a subset of tissue samples from patients with ACC (<i>n</i> = 15) and benign adrenal tumors (<i>n</i> = 15) in the training set.<b>Results:</b> Sixty-nine features were discovered and four known metabolites identified. Urinary creatine riboside was elevated 2.1-fold (<i>P</i> = 0.0001) in patients with ACC. L-tryptophan, N??,N??,N??-trimethyl-L-lysine, and 3-methylhistidine were lower 0.33-fold (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), 0.56-fold (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and 0.33-fold (<i>P</i> = 0.0003) in patients with ACC, respectively. Combined multivariate analysis of the four biomarkers showed an AUC of 0.89 [sensitivity 94.7% (confidence interval {CI}, 73.9%-99.1%), specificity 82.6% (CI, 68.6%-92.2%), PPV 69.2% (CI, 48.2%-85.6%), and NPV 97.4% (CI, 86.5%-99.6%)] for distinguishing ACC from benign tumors. Of the four, creatine riboside and four unknown features were validated. Creatine riboside, N??,N??,N??-trimethyl-L-lysine, and two unknown features were elevated in ACC tumors.<b>Conclusions:</b> There are unique urinary metabolic features in patients with ACC with some metabolites present in patient tumor samples. Urinary creatine riboside can differentiate benign adrenal neoplasms from ACC. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(17); 5302-10. ??2017 AACR</i>."
3,"Comparative Analysis of Methods for Detecting Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 and 2 Mutations and Their Metabolic Consequence, 2-Hydroxyglutarate, in Different Neoplasms.","Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations have been recognized in a few neoplasms including glioma, acute myeloid leukemia, chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. The direct methods to detect IDH mutations include DNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), or by measuring its byproduct, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), in the blood or urine. Moreover, conventional magnetic resonance imaging can be modified to magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure 2-HG in tumor. By conducting a search in Medline/PubMed and ISI/Web of Science for the published articles in English related to the methods for detection of IDH mutations and its byproduct 2-HG, we compared different methodologies to detect these mutations and discuss advantages and limitations of each method. Studies in which a methodology of detection was compared with another modality were included. Multiple studies have shown that both DNA sequencing and IHC are reliable methods for detecting IDH mutations in glioma and other solid neoplasms. IHC appeared to be less costly, easier to perform, and may be slightly more accurate than DNA sequencing. 2-HG has also been measured in bone marrow aspirate, serum and urine of patients with mutant IDH acute myeloid leukemia, and correlated very well with sequencing and IHC. Lastly, in some glioma patients, MRS detected IDH mutations noninvasively and reliably with excellent correlations with other modalities such as IHC and sequencing. In conclusion, IHC, MRS, and 2-HG detection all are clinically useful and comparable with DNA sequencing in identifying IDH mutations in different neoplasms. 2-HG and MRS can be utilized for monitoring treatment response in a variety of neoplasms."
3,The effectiveness of exercise-based rehabilitation to patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms-An explorative study.,"The aim of the study was to determine the impact of an interdisciplinary exercise-based rehabilitation intervention on fatigue and quality of life (QOL) in patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). At the Danish Knowledge Centre for Rehabilitation and Palliative Care, a 5-day interdisciplinary exercise-based rehabilitation intervention was carried out on 48 patients with MPN. It was followed by 12??weeks of self-exercising prior to follow-up. Initially and at follow-up, participants filled out validated questionnaires; Brief Fatigue Inventory, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life questionnaire, Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Maximal oxygen uptake and muscular strength were tested as well. Paired t test was used to compare scores between baseline and follow-up. In total, 45 participants (94%) completed the follow-up. No significant differences were observed on fatigue or QOL when comparing baseline and follow-up. Mean maximal oxygen uptake increased from 27.2 to 33.6??ml O<sub>2</sub> ????kg<sup>-1</sup> ????min<sup>-1</sup> (p??<??0.001). Handgrip strength (p??=??0.01) and the 30-s chair-stand test (p??<??0.001) improved as well. No changes were found regarding levels of fatigue and QOL. However, we observed a significant increase in the physical capacity. Our observations call for further studies investigating the effects of non-pharmacological approaches in patients with MPN."
3,Differences in Types and Incidence of Neoplasms in Wistar Han and Sprague-Dawley Rats.,"A substantial quantity of data on Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Hannover Wistar rats strains have been published concerning their source, diet, and housing conditions, as well as the incidences of nonneoplastic lesions and neoplasms observed in different laboratories. Differences between the commonly used rat strains provided by different breeders (i.e., CD (SD) vs. Harlan Sprague-Dawley strain or Crl: WI(Han) vs. Wistar Hannover (Han)-derived strain, continued breeding by RCC Ltd., Switzerland, thereafter continued breeding by Harlan) may include, but are not limited to, body weight, incidence, and onset of major nonneoplastic lesions and neoplasms, and these can impact the development of a nonclinical safety program. Fisher 344 (F344) and SD rat strains generally have the highest tumor incidences, exceeding that in Wistar rats. Certain tumors are more commonly observed in one strain, and for some, the difference in incidence may be so significant that the tumor may even be considered characteristic for a specific strain (e.g., thymoma in Wistar and amphophilic renal adenoma in SD)."
3,Classifying the evolutionary and ecological features of neoplasms.,"Neoplasms change over time through a process of cell-level evolution, driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. However, the ecology of the microenvironment of a neoplastic cell determines which changes provide adaptive benefits. There is widespread recognition of the importance of these evolutionary and ecological processes in cancer, but to date, no system has been proposed for drawing clinically relevant distinctions between how different tumours are evolving. On the basis of a consensus conference of experts in the fields of cancer evolution and cancer ecology, we propose a framework for classifying tumours that is based on four relevant components. These are the diversity of neoplastic cells (intratumoural heterogeneity) and changes over time in that diversity, which make up an evolutionary index (Evo-index), as well as the hazards to neoplastic cell survival and the resources available to neoplastic cells, which make up an ecological index (Eco-index). We review evidence demonstrating the importance of each of these factors and describe multiple methods that can be used to measure them. Development of this classification system holds promise for enabling clinicians to personalize optimal interventions based on the evolvability of the patient's tumour. The Evo- and Eco-indices provide a common lexicon for communicating about how neoplasms change in response to interventions, with potential implications for clinical trials, personalized medicine and basic cancer research."
3,Co-occurrence of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms and Solid Tumors Is Attributed to a Synergism Between Cytoreductive Therapy and the Common TERT Polymorphism rs2736100.,"The germline telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) rs2736100_C variant was identified as a susceptibility factor for a variety of solid tumors and recently for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).LightCycler melting curve analysis was applied to detect risk alleles of TERT rs2736100_C and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) rs12343867_C tagging 46/1 haplotype in 584 BCR-ABL1-negative MPN, 308 acute, and 86 chronic myeloid leukemia (AML and CML) patients and 400 healthy individuals.TERT rs2736100_C showed an increased allele frequency in BCR-ABL1-negative MPN patients compared with controls (62.7%??2.8% vs. 48.8%??3.5%, P < 0.0001) regardless of molecular background or disease type, but not in CML or AML. Combined TERT and JAK2 hetero- or homozygosity conferred even higher risk for classic MPN. Common complications (thrombosis, myelofibrosis, or leukemia) were not associated with the TERT variant; however, adverse survival was noted in TERT variant carrier polycythemia vera patients. MPN patients with the TERT CC genotype had a higher probability (44.4%) to die from solid tumors compared with TERT AC/AA individuals (5.3%; P = 0.004). TERT rs2736100_C carriers had increased risk of solid tumors independently from cytoreductive treatment [3.08 (1.03-9.26), P = 0.045].TERT rs2736100_C polymorphism predisposes to the development of BCR-ABL1-negative MPN with the co-occurrence of solid tumors, especially with the usage of cytoreductive treatment.The high frequency of TERT variant in the classic MPN population highlights the importance of the avoidance of long-term cytoreductive treatment in MPN patients."
3,Childhood neoplasms presenting at autopsy: A 20-year experience.,"The aims of the review are to establish the number of undiagnosed neoplasms presenting at autopsy in a single centre and to determine the incidence and most common causes of sudden unexpected death due to neoplasia in infancy and childhood (SUDNIC).Retrospective observational study of paediatric autopsies performed on behalf of Her Majesty's Coroner over a 20-year period (1996-2015; n = 2,432). Neoplasms first diagnosed at autopsy were identified from an established database and cases meeting the criteria for sudden unexpected death were further categorised.Thirteen previously undiagnosed neoplasms were identified, including five haematological malignancies, two medulloblastomas, two neuroblastomas, two cardiac tumours and two malignancies of renal origin. Eight cases met the criteria for SUDNIC (0.33% of autopsies), the commonest group of which were haematological malignancies (n = 3).Neoplasms presenting as unexpected death in infancy and childhood and diagnosed at autopsy are rare. The findings suggest that haematological malignancies are the commonest cause of SUDNIC and highlight the importance of specialist autopsy in cases of sudden unexpected death."
3,Influence of Demographic Determinants on the Number of Deaths Caused by Circulatory System Diseases in Comparison to the Number of Deaths Caused by Neoplasms in Slovak Regions from 1996-2014.,"The objective of our study was to evaluate the influence of available demographic determinants on the number of deaths caused by circulatory system diseases as compared to deaths caused by neoplasms in Slovakia in 1996-2014.Mortality data were kindly provided by the National Health Information Centre in Slovakia. The first method was trend curve fitting of death ratios caused by circulatory system diseases (Chapter IX) and of deaths caused by neoplasms (Chapter II) as a function of age for both sexes. The second method comprised a decision tree for classification between deaths caused by Chapter IX and Chapter II diseases. Input variables were available demographic indicators: age, sex, marital status, region, and calendar year of death. Statistical data analyses were performed by IBM SPSS version 19 statistical software.We found that the odds ratios of deaths caused by circulatory system diseases (Chapter IX) in comparison with deaths caused by neoplasms (Chapter II) were non-decreasing. At first, the values of odds ratios are constant until they reach a critical sex-dependent value with a subsequent steady increase. In the case of men the odds ratio was greater than in the 60 years age-group where the odds ratio value increased slowly (from 1.14 at age 60 to 7.25 at age 90 years). The relative increase was 6.36 (7.25/1.14). The odds ratio in the women group was smaller but increased more rapidly (from 0.81 at age 60 to 12.27 at age 90 years). The relative increase was 15.15 in women (12.27/0.81). Hence, the odds ratio of death caused by Chapter IX diseases vs. Chapter II was greater in the older women group (i.e. higher age values). Utilizing the decision tree model, we have found that the most significant demographic determinant of death counts in both ICD Chapters was the age of the deceased, followed by marital status and finally gender. The last two predictors (year and region) were relatively negligible though formally significant.The proposed method could be useful for prognostic classification of patients and primarily beneficial for hospitals in human or financial resources planning."
3,Urgent Chemotherapy for Life-Threatening Complications Related to Solid Neoplasms.,"Solid neoplasms can be directly responsible for organ failures at the time of diagnosis or relapse. The management of such specific complications relies on urgent chemotherapy and eventual instrumental or surgical procedures, combined with advanced life support. We conducted a multicenter study to address the prognosis of this condition.A multicenter retrospective (2001-2015) chart review.Medical and respiratory ICUs.Adult patients who received urgent chemotherapy in the ICU for organ failure related to solid neoplasms were included. The modalities of chemotherapy, requirements of adjuvant instrumental or surgical procedures, and organ supports were collected. Endpoints were short- and long-term survival rates.None.One hundred thirty-six patients were included. Lung cancer was the most common malignancy distributed into small cell lung cancer (n = 57) and non-small cell lung cancer (n = 33). The main reason for ICU admission was acute respiratory failure in 111 patients (81.6%), of whom 89 required invasive mechanical ventilation. Compression and tissue infiltration by tumor cells were the leading mechanisms resulting in organ involvement in 78 (57.4%) and 47 (34.6%) patients. The overall in-ICU, in-hospital, 6-month, and 1-year mortality rates were 37%, 58%, 74%, and 88%, respectively. Small cell lung cancer was identified as an independent predictor of hospital survival. However, this gain in survival was not sustained since the 1-year survival rates of small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and non-lung cancer patients all dropped below 20%.Urgent chemotherapy along with aggressive management of organ failures in the ICU can be lifesaving in very selected cancer patients, most especially with small cell lung cancer, although the long-term survival is hardly sustainable."
3,Public funding for medical research in relation to the burden of disease caused by cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms in Germany.,"Public funding for medical research in Germany is primarily provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The aim of this study was to analyze the amount of national public funding for medical research on predominant causes of death in Germany, cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in relation to the burden of these diseases in Germany.Three evaluators categorized medical research projects funded by the DFG or BMBF between 2010 and 2012 into the categories ""Diseases of the circulatory system"" (with subgroups ""Ischemic heart diseases"", ""Heart failure"" and ""Cerebrovascular diseases"") and ""Neoplasms"". The total amount of public funding by the national agencies was analyzed in relation to the burden of disease for the respective disease condition.Information on national public funding for medical research of 2091??million euros was available; of those, 246.8??million euros (11.8%) were categorized being spent for research on ""Neoplasms"", 118.4??million euros (5.7%) for research on ""Diseases of the circulatory system"". This results in 362.08 euros per case of death, 16.58 euros per year of life lost (YLL) and 16.04 euros per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) for ""Neoplasms"" and in 113.44 euros per case of death, 8.05 euros per YLL and 7.17 euros per DALY for ""Diseases of the circulatory system"".In Germany, research on cardiovascular diseases receives a lower share of national public funding for medical research compared to oncological research. These results are comparable to other European countries."
3,"Hematolymphoid neoplasms associated with rearrangements of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1.","This session of the 2013 Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology Workshop was dedicated to tumors currently included in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification category of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1.We use the cases submitted to this session to review the clinicopathologic and genetic spectrum of these neoplasms, methods for their diagnosis, and issues related to the WHO classification terminology. Since many patients with these neoplasms have eosinophilia, we also briefly mention other causes of clonal eosinophilia.These neoplasms are the result of gene fusions involving any one of these three tyrosine kinase genes. A variety of gene fusion partners have been found consistently for each category of neoplasms. Diagnoses of these neoplasms are often highly challenging and require a high index of suspicion and a multidisciplinary approach.Early recognition of these neoplasms is important because patients with neoplasms associated with PDGFRA or PDGFRB fusions often respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, whereas patients with neoplasms associated with FGFR1 fusions usually do not respond."
3,[Pediatric myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta gene rearrangement: a case report and literature review].,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical features and therapeutic strategies of childhood myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) gene rearrangement. <b>Methods:</b> Clinical data of myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and t (1;5) (q21;q33) chromosomal translocation of PDGFRB gene rearrangement in a child hospitalized in Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences on May 2015 was collected and analyzed. Using'eosinophilia child'and'PDGFRB'as keywords, the relevant reports in literature were searched from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and Biomedical Literature Database (PubMed) until April 2017. <b>Results:</b> The patient was a boy, 19 months old, who began to get sick at six months after birth, with the main clinical manifestations of high fever, diarrhea, epistaxis and hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood smear showed a significant elevation in white blood cells (127??10(9)/L) and eosinophils(20.32??10(9)/L). Bone marrow examination showed hyperplastic marrow, increased proportion of granulocytes, apparent visible eosinophils and decreased megakaryocytes. Chromosome karyotype detection revealed t (1; 5) (q21; q33) translocation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) examination uncovered that PDGFRB gene rearrangement was positive. The final diagnosis was myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia and PDGFRB gene rearrangement. After treatment with oral imatinib 100 mg, once a day for 2 months, complete hematologic remission, complete cytogenetic and molecular remission were all achieved. The relevant literature was reviewed, no Chinese cases had been reported, 6 reports in English literature have complete clinical data. Four cases had t (1; 5) translocation. Four pediatric patients treated with imatinib achieved complete remission. <b>Conclusion:</b> Myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and PDGFRB gene rearrangement is extremely rare in children. Imatinib treatment can make these patients quickly achieve complete hematologic remission, complete cytogenetic and molecular remission. Imatinib should be recommended as the first line treatment of these patients."
3,Risk of malignant neoplasms in acromegaly: a case-control study.,"Acromegaly is a chronic disease resulting from pathological oversecretion of growth hormone and subsequently insulin growth factor-1. Several complications of the disease have been reported, including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disorders but also increased risk of benign and malignant neoplasms. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk of malignant neoplasms in the patients with acromegaly in comparison with the control group.Medical documentation of acromegalic patients treated in one medical center between 2005 and 2016 has been analyzed. Results were compared with sex- and age-matched group of subjects with prolactinomas and hormonally inactive pituitary lesions hospitalized in the same department.Two hundred patients with acromegaly were included. Control group was composed of 145 patients. Any malignant neoplasm in anamnesis was present in 27 (13.5??%) patients with acromegaly and six (4.1??%) subjects from control group (p??=??0.003). Thyroid cancer was present in 14 (7.0??%) patients with acromegaly and two (1.4??%) in control group (p??=??0.02). Breast cancer was present in seven women (5.4??% of women) in acromegaly group but none of subjects in control group (p??=??0.02). Colon cancer-4 (2.0??%) patients in acromegaly group and 0 in control group (p??=??0.14).Malignant neoplasms are significantly more common in patients with acromegaly. Particularly, risk of thyroid cancer was increased over fivefold. Systematic screening for neoplastic diseases should be important part of follow-up in these patients. Further case-control studies are strongly indicated to evaluate which neoplasms are more common in acromegalic patients and what is the exact risk of malignancy."
3,The 2017 WHO update on mature T- and natural killer (NK) cell neoplasms.,"Over the last decade, there has been a significant body of information regarding the biology of the lymphoid neoplasms. This clearly supports the need for updating the 2008 WHO (World Health Organization) classification of haematopoietic and lymphoid tumours. The 2017 WHO classification is not a new edition but an update and revision of the 4th edition. New provisional entities but not new definitive entities are included, and novel molecular data in most of the entities and changes in the nomenclature in few of them have been incorporated. In the context of the mature T- and NK-cell neoplasms, the most relevant updates concern to: 1-dysregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway due to gene mutations which are common to various aggressive and indolent neoplasms; 2-incorporation of new molecular players that are relevant to the pathogenesis of these neoplasms and/or have prognostic implications; 3-inclusion of new provisional entities within the subgroups of anaplastic, primarily intestinal and cutaneous lymphomas such as breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and primary cutaneous acral CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell lymphoma; 4-identification of poor prognostic subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphomas not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) characterized by overexpression of certain genes and of a subgroup PTCL, NOS with a T follicular phenotype that now is included together with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma under the umbrella of lymphomas with a T follicular helper phenotype; and 5-refinement on the designation and definition of already established entities. A review of the major changes will be outlined."
3,"CD30 Expression in Pediatric Neoplasms, Study of 585 Cases.","CD30 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 8 (TNFRSF8), and its normal expression is restricted to activated T and B cells. In tumor cells, CD30 expression is most commonly associated with lymphoid malignancies (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas) and is a therapeutic target using anti-CD30 antibody. CD30 expression has been reported also in mostly adult non-lymphoid malignancies, raising the possibility of CD30-targeted therapy for additional tumors. In this study, we examined the incidence of CD30 expression in 251 hematopoietic and 334 non-hematopoietic cases of pediatric tumors. As expected, strong and membranous CD30 staining was seen in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and embryonal carcinoma while variable staining was seen in diffuse large B cell lymphoma. In addition, positive CD30 staining was also seen in cases of neuroblastoma (33 of 56), neoplasm with chondroid differentiation (8 of 25), myeloid neoplasms (11 of 120), hemangioma (2 of 12), and mature teratoma (1 of 11). In neuroblastoma, the CD30 expression was generally restricted to cells with ganglion differentiation; staining of ganglion cells was also seen in the one positive case of mature teratoma. In neoplasm with chondroid differentiation, the positive cases were chondrosarcoma (3 of 5), chondroblastic osteosarcoma (2 of 10), and chondroblastoma (3 of 7). In acute myeloid leukemia, the CD30 positive cases were more common in AML with monocytic differentiation but did not correlate with any specific molecular change. We conclude that CD30 expression in pediatric tumors is more general than anticipated and future studies are warranted to understand the biologic and therapeutic significances."
3,"Sunitinib for the treatment of benign and malignant neoplasms from von Hippel-Lindau disease: A single-arm, prospective phase II clinical study from the PREDIR group.","Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome that predisposes affected individuals to the development of multiple benign and malignant tumors. One of the main manifestations of VHL is renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RCC is increasingly being treated with targeted therapies, which offer an alternative treatment option for patients with VHL disease. This study investigated the effectiveness of sunitinib in VHL patients with advanced tumors or tumors unsuitable for surgery.This multicenter, phase II, open-label study from the PREDIR VHL network, treated patients with genetically-confirmed advanced VHL disease with oral sunitinib (50 mg/day for 28 days then a 2-week rest period) until progression. Lesions were performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic (CT) scan. The primary endpoint was objective response rate; secondary endpoints included tolerability and overall survival.All five patients showed stable disease as best response at 6 months. Two patients showed impressive transitory clinical improvement during early cycles. No patient died during sunitinib treatment. Reasons for discontinuing sunitinib therapy were disease progression (n=1), unacceptable toxicity (n=3) and lack of clinical improvement after 7 cycles (10.5 months) with unacceptable toxicity (n=1).In conclusion, sunitinib was of limited benefit in patients with advanced VHL disease, but had better efficacy against metastatic RCC than other VHL-related lesions. Treatment-related toxicity is an important limiting factor in this frail patient population. New agents with different mechanisms of action are required to treat this disease."
3,Serum Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 in Differential Diagnosis of Benign and Malignant Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms: A Meta-Analysis.,"Using serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) in discriminating between benign and malignant pancreatic disease remains controversial. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum CA 19-9 in predicting malignant pancreatic cystic lesions.Eligible studies were identified through searching MEDLINE and EMBASE prior to March 2016. Studies were assessed for quality using the Quality Assessment for Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy, 2nd version (QUADAS-2). Pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random-effects models. Summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curves and the area under curve (AUC) were performed.A total of thirteen studies including 1437 patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.47(95% CI: 0.35-0.59), and 0.88(95% CI: 0.86-0.91), respectively, and the AUC was 0.87(95% CI, 0.84-0.90). Meta-regression analysis showed that sample size, region and reference standards were not the main sources of heterogeneity.Serum CA 19-9 has satisfying pooled specificity while poor pooled sensitivity for discriminating benign from malignant PCNs. It deserves to be widely used as complementary to other clinical diagnostic methods."
3,Genetic variation as a modifier of association between therapeutic exposure and subsequent malignant neoplasms in cancer survivors.,"Subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are associated with significant morbidity and are a major cause of premature mortality among cancer survivors. Several large studies have demonstrated a strong association between the radiation and/or chemotherapy used to treat primary cancer and the risk of developing SMNs. However, for any given therapeutic exposure, the risk of developing an SMN varies between individuals. Genomic variation can potentially modify the association between therapeutic exposures and SMN risk and may explain the observed interindividual variability. In this review, the author provides a brief overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of genomic variation in the development of therapy-related SMNs and discusses the methodological challenges in undertaking an endeavor to develop a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of therapy-related SMNs, such as an appropriate study design, the identification of an adequately sized study population together with a reliable plan for collecting and maintaining high-quality DNA, clinical validation of the phenotype, and the selection of an appropriate approach or platform for genotyping. Understanding the factors that can modify the risk of treatment-related SMNs is critical to developing targeted intervention strategies and optimizing risk-based health care for cancer survivors."
3,De Novo Malignant Neoplasms in Renal Transplant Patients.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of posttransplant malignancy in kidney transplant patients and investigate the clinical and histopathologic features of these patients.We retrospectively reviewed information on donor and recipient characteristics, patient and graft survival, and cancer incidence after transplant for 867 kidney transplant patients. Patients with neoplasms prior to transplant were excluded. A follow-up study estimated cancer incidence after transplant.Neoplasms were diagnosed in 59 patients (6.8%), 41 men and 18 women; 22 (37.3%) had skin tumors, 19 (32.2%) had solid tumors, 10 (16.9%) had posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, and 8 (13.6%) had Kaposi sarcoma. The mean age at the time of malignant tumor diagnosis was 42.7 ?? 13.6 years, and statistically significant differences were found between tumor groups (P < .01). The average latency period between transplant and diagnosis of malignant tumors was 99.8 ?? 56.9 months for solid tumors, 78.4 ?? 52 months for skin tumors, 64.5 ?? 48.8 months for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, and 13.5 ?? 8.8 months for Kaposi sarcoma, with significant difference found between tumor groups (P < .01). Ten patients (16.9%) had more than 1 malignant tumor. Eighteen patients died, with a mean time to death of 31.5 ?? 22.8 months after tumor diagnosis. A significant positive association was found between survival and the number of tumors (P = .001); 5-year survival after tumor diagnosis was 81% and 40% for patients with 1 malignant tumor and patients with more than 1 malignant tumor, respectively.Malignancy is a common cause of death after renal transplant. Early detection and treatment of posttransplant malignancies is an important challenge. Screening these patients for malignancies posttransplant is crucial, and efforts should be directed to define effective immunosuppressive protocols that are associated with a lower incidence of malignancy."
3,[Relationship between the gene polymorphisms of oxidative metabolism enzyme of exogenous chemicals and the susceptibility to neoplasms].,"The gene polymorphisms of human being will cause abnormality in the expression of corresponding gene, which is closely related to the physiological function and disease. Cytochrome P450, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase are vital enzymes that mediated the oxidative metabolism process for exogenous chemicals, and play important roles in activating the indirect carcinogens and metabolizing clinical drug; the gene polymorphisms of these enzymes can change the expression and activity of enzymes, affect the metabolic transformation of carcinogens, and then give rise to difference in the susceptibility to neoplasms. Studying the relationship between the gene polymorphisms of oxidative metabolism enzyme for endogenous and exogenous chemicals and the susceptibility to neoplasms can provide scientific basis for probing into the genetic markers and the pathogenesis of neoplasms."
3,Cardiovascular Events: A Challenge in JAK2-positive Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic blood disorders caused by clonal expansion in one or more myeloid lineages and include essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Cardiovascular events are a main challenge for patients with MPN and can lead to their death.JAK2V617F mutation is observed in Philadelphia-negative MPNs such as ET and PV, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications in these patients. JAK2 mutation can affect cardiac arteries and veins in ET and PV, which results in thrombosis, ischemia and other cardiovascular events. JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays an important role in heart diseases. In this review, we will survey the cardiovascular events in JAK2-positive MPN patients.Relevant English-language literature were searched and retrieved from PubMed search engine (1995-2017). The following keywords were used: ""Cardiovascular Events"", ""JAK2"" and ""Myeloproliferative Neoplasms"". Forty three articles were selected by using the key words.JAK2 phosphorylates the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). Various factors like angiotensin II (ANG II) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) can bind their receptors on myocytes and increase the expression of angiotensinogen (Ao) gene by binding of STAT proteins to these factors in myocytes, causing different cardiovascular complications through autocrine mechanisms.JAK2 mutation is observed in patients with thrombosis, ischemia and other cardiovascular complications having abnormal increase in cell count even without definite clinical diagnosis of MPN. Therefore, identification of this mutation in these patients contributes to definite diagnosis of cardiovascular events. Also, cardiovascular complications in MPN patients can be prevented by targeting the factors involved in JAK/STAT signaling pathway."
3,[Pathologic characteristics of malignant neoplasms occurring in the elderly].,"Malignant neoplasm preferentially occurs in the elderly. Common cancers in the elderly are gastric, colorectal, lung and prostate cancers in men whereas colorectal, lung, gastric and pancreatic cancers in women. There are several characteristic features such as tumor location, histology, biological behavior and pathway of carcinogenesis in malignant neoplasms occurring in the elderly. Multiple cancers increase with aging. Although it is generally believed that carcinoma in the elderly shows well differentiation, slow growth, low incidence of metastasis and favorable prognosis, the tumor does not always show such features. Regarding biological behavior of malignant tumor in the elderly, age-related alterations of the host such as stromal weakness and decreased immune response against cancer cell invasion should be considered as well as characteristics of tumor cell itself. Thus, we need a specific strategy for treatment for malignant neoplasms in the elderly."
3,Prone Transradial Catheterization for Combined Single-Session Transarterial Embolization and Percutaneous Posterior Approach Cryoablation of Solid Neoplasms.,"Transradial access (TRA) has been associated with improved post-procedure hemostasis and patient satisfaction, and decreased hemorrhagic complications, sedation requirements, recovery times, and procedure-related costs when compared with traditional transfemoral catheterization. Supine TRA has been described for the treatment of myocardial infarctions, aortoiliac and femoropopliteal stenoses, and a variety of neoplasms. This original research describes prone transradial catheterization to facilitate combined single-session transarterial embolization and percutaneous cryoablation of solid neoplasms from a posterior approach without repositioning. Prone TRA access, transarterial embolization, and percutaneous cryoablation were successful in all cases described. Mean procedure time was 210??min (range: 140-250??min). One minor complication, transient bacteremia which responded to antibiotics, was reported. No major complications occurred."
3,Neoplastic disease after liver transplantation: Focus on de novo neoplasms.,"De novo neoplasms account for almost 30% of deaths 10 years after liver transplantation and are the most common cause of mortality in patients surviving at least 1 year after transplant. The risk of malignancy is two to four times higher in transplant recipients than in an age- and sex-matched population, and cancer is expected to surpass cardiovascular complications as the primary cause of death in transplanted patients within the next 2 decades. Since exposure to immunosuppression is associated with an increased frequency of developing neoplasm, long-term immunosuppression should be therefore minimized. Promising results in the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence have been reported with the use of mTOR inhibitors including everolimus and sirolimus and the ongoing open-label prospective randomized controlled SILVER. Study will provide more information on whether sirolimus-containing vs mTOR-inhibitor-free immunosuppression is more efficacious in reducing HCC recurrence. "
3,[Full thickness resection device (FTRD). Experience and outcome for benign neoplasms of the rectum and colon].,"The diagnostic validity of a full-thickness resection is higher compared to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic mucosal dissection (ESD). Whereas transanal endoscopic microsurgery techniques (TEM, TAMIS) are established therapeutic procedures in the rectum no established and safe minimally invasive or endoscopic procedure exists in the colon.In this study the novel endoscopic full thickness resection device (FTRD, Ovesco, Germany) was investigated concerning success rates with histologically proven full thickness resections, R0 status as well as patient and device safety for the rectum and colon.In the period from November 2014 to June 2015 full thickness resections in the rectum and colon were performed with the FTRD in 20 patients. Data on technical success, R0 resection rate and histologically confirmed full thickness resections were retrospectively analyzed.The following indications were treated in the rectum (n?€?=?€?11) and colon (n?€?=?€?9): T1 carcinoma (n?€?=?€?6) and neuroendocrine tumors (n?€?=?€?2), untreated and nonlifting adenomas (n?€?=?€?3) and incomplete resection of adenomas with low and high grade dysplasia (n?€?=?€?9). The technical success rate was 75?€?%, 3 technical failures made a conventional polypectomy necessary in 2 patients and in 1 patient an operative resection of the duplicated intestinal wall had to be performed. The median endoscopic follow-up time was 61.5 days (n?€?=?€?10) and in 7 patients the clip had dislodged at the first follow-up. A thermal perforation in one case of conventional polypectomy gave rise to indications for a partial resection of the colon. In one patient the lesion in the cecum could be reached but not treated for technical reasons. The histological R0 rate was 80?€?%, whereas the full thickness resection rate was 60?€?% (85.7?€?% in the colon and 54.6?€?% in the rectum). In two patients with carcinoma and incomplete FTRD, surgical treatment was performed. The median size of the resection specimen was 5?€???cm(2) (range 1.6-12.9?€???cm(2)).The results show that FTRD is a safe and effective instrument for use in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Limitations of the FTRD system concerning full thickness resection are scarring, fibrosis and thickness of the intestinal wall, especially in the lower rectum; therefore, it is suggested that a simulation with a tube similar in size to the FTRD should be performed during the screening colonoscopy in order to establish whether an endoscopic resection with FTRD is possible."
3,Preexisting Interstitial Lung Disease and Lung Injury Associated with Irinotecan in Patients with Neoplasms.,"The aim of this study was to reveal risk factors for lung injury following irinotecan administration for the treatment of neoplasms.This study included 204 patients who received irinotecan from October 2005 to November 2014 and had evaluable chest CT images before initiation of irinotecan.Six (2.9%) patients developed lung injury and, of these, 2 had preexisting interstitial lung disease (pre-ILD). The frequency of lung injury in patients with pre-ILD was 11% (2 of 19) while that in patients without pre-ILD was 2.2%. Risk factor analysis for the lung injury showed pre-ILD was the most predictable factor [odds ratio (OR) 5.00, p=0.07]. Combination with other agents, origin of neoplasms (lung or not), initial dose or minimum interval were not observed to be related to risk.The risk of lung injury with irinotecan was high when pre-ILD was present and the risk was comparable with previously reported other agents."
3,Somatic and Germline <i>TP53</i> Alterations in Second Malignant Neoplasms from Pediatric Cancer Survivors.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are severe late complications that occur in pediatric cancer survivors exposed to radiotherapy and other genotoxic treatments. To characterize the mutational landscape of treatment-induced sarcomas and to identify candidate SMN-predisposing variants, we analyzed germline and SMN samples from pediatric cancer survivors.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on radiation-induced sarcomas arising from two pediatric cancer survivors. To assess the frequency of germline <i>TP53</i> variants in SMNs, Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze germline <i>TP53</i> in 37 pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) without any history of a familial cancer predisposition syndrome but known to have developed SMNs.<b>Results:</b> WES revealed <i>TP53</i> mutations involving p53's DNA-binding domain in both index cases, one of which was also present in the germline. The germline and somatic <i>TP53-</i>mutant variants were enriched in the transcriptomes for both sarcomas. Analysis of <i>TP53-</i>coding exons in germline specimens from the CCSS survivor cohort identified a G215C variant encoding an R72P amino acid substitution in 6 patients and a synonymous SNP A639G in 4 others, resulting in 10 of 37 evaluable patients (27%) harboring a germline <i>TP53</i> variant.<b>Conclusions:</b> Currently, germline <i>TP53</i> is not routinely assessed in patients with pediatric cancer. These data support the concept that identifying germline <i>TP53</i> variants at the time a primary cancer is diagnosed may identify patients at high risk for SMN development, who could benefit from modified therapeutic strategies and/or intensive posttreatment monitoring. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(7); 1852-61. ??2016 AACR</i>."
3,Percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage combined with percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy for maintaining nutrition state in patients with advanced ampullary neoplasms.,"To investigate the role of percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD) combined with percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) in maintaining the nutrition state in patients with advanced ampullary neoplasms.Sixty patients who suffered from advanced ampullary neoplasms and could not tolerate internal drainage operation or biliary stent placement were enrolled. After PTCD, PEJ was implemented, and then the enteral nutrient solution + bile were instilled through PEJ tube for enteral nutrition support. Before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after surgery, the body weight, bilirubin, liver function, nutritional status, and immunologic function indexes were detected and compared.All patients had successfully completed PTCD combined with PEJ, and no serious complication occurred. The body mass index of the patients from 4 weeks after surgery was significantly higher than before (P < 0.05). From 2 weeks, both serum total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels were significantly lower than before (P < 0.05). From 1 week, both alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly lower than before (P < 0.05); from 2 weeks, the level of gamma-glutamyl transferase was significantly lower than before (P < 0.05). From 1 week, the levels of albumin, transferrin, and prealbumin were significantly increased compared with before (P < 0.05), and serum CD3+ cell content, CD4+ cell content, and CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8+ ratio were significantly improved compared with before (P < 0.05).PTCD combined with PEJ is a safe and effective method for maintaining nutrition state in patients with advanced ampullary neoplasms."
3,"Mesenchymal Neoplasms of the Genitourinary System: A Selected Review with Recent Advances in Clinical, Diagnostic, and Molecular Findings.","Mesenchymal neoplasms of the genitourinary (GU) tract often pose considerable diagnostic challenges due to their wide morphologic spectrum, relative rarity, and unexpected incidence at GU sites. Soft tissue tumors arise throughout the GU tract, whether from adventitia surrounding or connective tissues within the kidneys, urinary bladder, and male and female genital organs. This selected article focuses on a subset of these lesions, ranging from benign to malignant and encompassing a range of patterns of mesenchymal differentiation, where recent scholarship has lent greater insight into their clinical, molecular, or diagnostic features."
3,"Association between vascular endothelial growth factor rs699947 polymorphism and the risk of three major urologic neoplasms (bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma): A meta-analysis involving 11,204 subjects.","The relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene variant rs699947 polymorphism and urologic neoplasms risk was studied extensively in recent years. The VEGF gene plays a key role in angiogenesis of urologic neoplasms, but some conclusions are still inconclusive. The aim of this study was to determine whether this polymorphism is a risk factor for susceptibility to urologic neoplasms by conducting a meta-analysis.We performed a meta-analysis of 15 different publications from the PubMed, Embase and Medline databases, to better assess the association between VEGF rs699947 polymorphism and urologic neoplasms risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using random or fixed effects models.By pooling all eligible studies, we found that the VEGF rs699947 polymorphism was not associated with overall urologic neoplasms. However, subgroup analysis based on cancer types demonstrated that significantly increased association was found between VEGF rs699947 polymorphism and the risk of bladder cancer (BCa) under heterozygous genetic model (OR?€?=?€?1.48, 95%CI?€?=?€?1.17-1.89). And rs699947 polymorphism was also identified an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) under dominant, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous and allelic contrast genetic models, while no association was observed in prostate cancer (PCa). In addition, in subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we found rs699947 polymorphism was associated with Asian population under dominant, homozygous, heterozygous and allelic contrast genetic models. No evidence of publication bias was found (Begg's test, P?€?=?€?0.855; Egger's test, P?€?=?€?0.590).In summary, our study showed evidence that the VEGF rs699947 polymorphism was obviously associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma, particularly in Asian population, while no significant association was observed in overall urologic neoplasms. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further evaluate these associations in more details."
3,Second Malignant Neoplasms in Childhood Cancer Survivors Treated in a Tertiary Paediatric Oncology Centre.,"<u>Introduction</u>: One of the most feared complications of childhood cancer treatment is second malignant neoplasms (SMNs). This study evaluates the incidence, risk factors and outcomes of SMNs in a tertiary paediatric oncology centre in Singapore. <u>Materials and Methods</u>: A retrospective review was conducted on patients diagnosed with childhood cancer under age 21 and treated at the National University Hospital, Singapore, from January 1990 to 15 April 2012. Case records of patients with SMNs were reviewed. <u>Results</u>: We identified 1124 cases of childhood cancers with a median follow-up of 3.49 (0 to 24.06) years. The most common primary malignancies were leukaemia (47.1%), central nervous system tumours (11.7%) and lymphoma (9.8%). Fifteen cases developed SMNs, most commonly acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 7). Median interval between the first and second malignancy was 3.41 (0.24 to 18.30) years. Overall 20-year cumulative incidence of SMNs was 5.3% (95% CI, 0.2% to 10.4%). The 15-year cumulative incidence of SMNs following acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was 4.4% (95% CI, 0% to 8.9%), significantly lower than the risk after osteosarcoma of 14.2% (95% CI, 0.7% to 27.7%) within 5 years (<i>P</i> <0.0005). Overall 5-year survival for SMNs was lower than that of primary malignancies. <u>Conclusion</u>: This study identified factors explaining the epidemiology of SMNs described, and found topoisomerase II inhibitor use to be a likely risk factor in our cohort. Modifications have already been made to our existing therapeutic protocols in osteosarcoma treatment. We also recognised the importance of other risk management strategies, including regular long-term surveillance and early intervention for detected SMNs, to improve outcomes of high risk patients."
3,Patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms can benefit from management of multidisciplinary team: Experience from a Chinese academic center.,"Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) are a spectrum of neoplasms that can be benign or malignant. The accuracy of diagnosis is critical for this disease since different types of PCNs are treated differently using various modalities. The use of a multidisciplinary team (MDT) has been shown to improve the management and outcomes of various diseases. We aimed to determine the performance of MDT in the management of PCNs.We retrospectively reviewed 167 pathologically-proven PCN patients and divided them among three groups according to their surgical data and treatment modalities: 1) historical control group (HC group); 2) concurrent control group (CC group); and 3) MDT group. The composition of subtypes of PCNs, preoperative diagnostic accuracy, postoperative complications, and postoperative hospital stay were compared among the three groups.The incidence of SCN reduced in the MDT group, while the incidence of IPMN was much higher (P?€?<?€?0.05). MDT management significantly improved the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis (71.7%) and also increased the individual diagnostic accuracies of ultrasound, CT, and MRI/MRCP. Postoperative pancreatic fistula was significantly reduced in the MDT group (28.3%; P?€?<?€?0.001). Furthermore, the mean hospital stay after surgery in the MDT group (10.37 days) was shorter than those of the other two groups (27.35 days in HC group, and 19.28 days in CC group; P?€?<?€?0.05).For patients with PCN, MDT management was associated with an improvement in the overall accuracy of preoperative diagnosis, a lower incidence postoperative morbidity, and decreased length of hospital stay."
3,Management and prognosis of low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms: A clinicopathologic analysis of 50 cases.,"Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMN) are poorly understood lesions characterized by their potential to spread to the peritoneal cavity as pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and pathologic features and management of these tumors.This was a retrospective study of consecutive patients with LAMN who underwent surgery by a surgical team at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University between 2005 and 2016. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with PMP.The study included 50 LAMN patients, 13 of them with PMP. There were no significant differences in age (p??=??0.293) or gender (p??=??0.196) at diagnosis between the two groups. There was no significant difference in their presentation (p??=??0.700). Although 5 patients with PMP had perforation of the appendiceal mucinous, acute peritonitis was uncommon. Microscopic examination detected that PMP without any obvious perforation in tumors shown mucin and/or mucinous epithelium herniating into the appendiceal wall, or as islands within these tissues. The patients underwent appendectomy, caecectomy and right hemicolectomy according to the intraoperative situation. The median follow-up period was 53 months (range 11-146 months). None of the patients developed clinical progression in either group during the follow-up period.The age of LAMN at presentation was almost 60 years (56.7) and there was no clear gender predilection. When LAMN was treated surgically with resection of the primary site in early stage disease or with pushing invasion, there was an excellent prognosis and expanded surgical procedures were unnecessary."
3,"The Problem of High-Grade Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Well-Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors, Neuroendocrine Carcinomas, and Beyond.","High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms are well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors or poorly differentiated small/large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Distinguishing these entities relies on different genetic backgrounds and resulting different biology. The new classification creates several problems. Almost all clinical treatment data on neuroendocrine neoplasms do not stratify between well and poorly differentiated, providing insufficient help in treatment selection. Treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms should separate between well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and neuroendocrine carcinoma, and depends on primary tumor site, stage, proliferation rate, and clinical course. This article addresses how to diagnose and treat gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, focusing on well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors versus neuroendocrine carcinomas."
3,"Neoplasms (C00-D48) in Osijek-Baranja County from 2001 to 2006, Croatia.","The Institute of Public Health of the Osijek-Baranja County has processed the data on cancer patients that were collected from mandatory county hospitals data reports, county bureaus of statistics and the County Register of Deaths. The cancers were defined according the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), codes of malignant neoplasms (C00-C97), in situ neoplasms (D00-D09) and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behaviour (D37-D48). The aim of this article was to show the size of the cancer problem in Osijek-Baranja County (OBC) according to the all ICD-10 cancer groups. The cancer incidence and mortality estimated in period 2001-2006 were prepared for all cancers based on gender and for age groups 0-19, 20-44, 45-64, 65+ by the year of the first diagnosis of cancer. The median age at cancer diagnosis was 62.7 years, 61.2 years for females and 64.1 years for males. Applying the EU age-standardized rate, the average annual incidence and mortality rates in the OBC were 411.6/ 100,000 and 240.7/100,000, respectively. The incidence rates in both genders were highest for neoplasms of digestive organs (C15-C26), respiratory and intrathoracic organs (C30-C39) and for breast (C50) (101.1, 63.6 and 44.3/100,000, respectively). The first two groups of cancer in both genders were also the leading groups of cancer in males (141.6 and 124.9/100,000). The third position in males belonged to neoplasms of male's genital organs (C60-C63, 58/100,000). The leading group in females was C50 (79.3/100,000), followed by groups C15-C26 (73.2/100,000) and in situ neoplasms (D00-D09) (51.4/100,000). The course and shape of mortality rate in the whole corresponded to the incidence rate, but at the lower level. The only exception referred to group C15-C26 (56.8/100,000) as leading mortality cancer group in females. The overall 5-year relative survival was 40.1%. Considering females, this rate amounted to 48.8% while this figure was much lower in men--32.4%. In age group 65+, 52.6% of cancer patients developed a cancer and 65.4% of patients died at the same age. These basic parameters indicate that the OBC must put great efforts in creating a long-term strategy for cancer prevention and early diagnostics in order to prolong life and improve the quality of life of cancer patients and raise the proportion of 5-year survival."
3,Variability of the Ki-67 proliferation index in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms - a single-center retrospective study.,"The Ki-67 index in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) may change throughout the disease course. However, the definitive effect of Ki-67 variability on GEP-NENs remains unknown. The aims of this study were to evaluate changes in Ki-67 levels throughout the disease course and investigate the role of Ki-67 index variability in GEP-NENs.Specimens with multiple pathologies were evaluated from 30 patients who were selected from 514 patients with GEP-NENs, being treated at Wuhan Union Hospital from July 2009 to February 2018. The Ki-67 index was evaluated among multiple specimens over the disease course. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess the prognostic significance of various clinical and histopathologic features.Among the 514 patients with GEP-NENs, metastases were seen in 182 (35.41%). Among the 30 patients from whom specimens with multiple pathologies were obtained, 24 were both primary and metastatic specimens and six were specimens collected over the course of the disease. Changes in Ki-67 levels were detected in 53.3% of the patients, of whom 40% had up-regulated Ki-67 levels, and 13.3% had down-regulated Ki-67 levels. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the group with Ki-67 variability had a shorter overall survival (p?€?=?€?0.0297). The Cox regression analysis indicated that Ki-67 variability (p?€?=?€?0.038) was the only independent prognostic factor for overall survival.Our data suggest that patients with GEP-NENs and Ki-67 variability had a poorer prognosis. The re-assessment of Ki-67 at sites of metastasis or during the disease course might play a role in predicting the prognosis of patients with GEP-NENs. This finding could have implications for how GEP-NENs are monitored and treated."
3,Dietary patterns and risk of advanced colorectal neoplasms: A large population based screening study in Germany.,"Specific components of the diet such as red and processed meat have been associated with the risk of developing colorectal cancer. However, evidence on the association of dietary patterns with colorectal neoplasms is sparse. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of dietary patterns with prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasms among older adults in Germany. A cross-sectional study was conducted among participants of screening colonoscopy in Saarland, Germany, who were enrolled in the KolosSal study (Effektivit??t der Fr??herkennungs-Koloskopie: eine Saarland-weite Studie) from 2005 to 2013. Information on diet and lifestyle factors was obtained through questionnaires and colonoscopy results were extracted from physicians' reports. Associations of a priori defined dietary patterns (vegetarian or adapted versions of the Healthy Eating Index [HEI] and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] index) with the risk of advanced colorectal neoplasms were assessed by multiple logistic regression analyses with comprehensive adjustment for potential confounders. A total of 14,309 participants were included (1561 with advanced colorectal neoplasms). Healthier eating behavior was associated with lower prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasms in a dose-response manner. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) comparing the highest with the lowest categories of adapted HEI and DASH were 0.61 (0.50, 0.76) and 0.70 (0.55, 0.89), respectively. No significant associations were observed for a vegetarian eating pattern (adjusted OR 0.80 (0.55, 1.17)). Healthy dietary patterns, as described by a high HEI or DASH score, but not a vegetarian diet alone, are associated with reduced risk of advanced colorectal neoplasms."
3,Correlation between MGMT promoter methylation and response to temozolomide-based therapy in neuroendocrine neoplasms: an observational retrospective multicenter study.,"Temozolomide (TEM) based therapy has been reported being effective in the treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN), with response rates ranging from 30 to 70%. Among patients affected by advanced glioblastoma or melanoma and treated with TEM, loss of tumoral O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is correlated with improved survival. In NEN patients, the role of MGMT deficiency in predicting clinical outcomes of TEM treatment is still under debate.In this study we evaluated 95 patients with advanced NENs undergoing treatment with TEM-based therapy. MGMT promoter methylation status was evaluated with two techniques: methylation specific-polymerase chain reaction or pyrosequencing.Treatment with TEM-based therapy was associated with an overall response rate of 27.4% according to RECIST criteria (51.8% of patients with and 17.7% without MGMT promoter methylation). Response to therapy, progression free survival and overall survival was correlated to MGMT status at univariate and multivariate analysis. Methylation of MGMT promoter could be a strong predictive factor of objective response and an important prognostic factor of a longer PFS and OS.According to our results, MGMT methylation status, evaluated with methylation specific-polymerase chain reaction or pyrosequencing, should have an important role in patients with metastatic NENs, in order to guide therapeutic options. These results need further confirmation with prospective studies."
3,Risk factors for development of internal neoplasms in koi carp Cyprinus carpio koi.,"Fish, like mammals, can be affected by neoplastic proliferations. As yet, there are only a very small number of studies reporting on the occurrence of tumours in koi carp Cyprinus carpio koi and only sporadic reports on the nature of the tumours or on risk factors associated with their development. Between 2008 and 2012, koi with abdominal swelling were examined pathologically: neoplastic lesions were diagnosed and classified histologically. We evaluated possible risk factors for the development of these internal neoplasms in koi carp in Switzerland, using an online 2-part questionnaire sent to fish keepers with koi affected by internal tumours and to fish keepers who had not previously reported any affected koi. Part 1 addressed all participants and focused on general information about koi husbandry and pond technical data; Part 2 addressed participants that had one or several case(s) of koi with internal tumour(s) between 2008 and 2012, and consisted of specific questions about affected koi. A total of 112 internal tumours were reported by the 353 koi keepers participating in the survey. Analysis of the obtained data revealed that tumour occurrence was significantly associated with the location (indoors vs. outdoors) and volume of the pond, frequency of water changes, origin of the koi, number of koi kept in a pond and the use of certain pond disinfectant/medication products. Our results contribute to the identification of possible risk factors, which in turn could help to establish prophylactic measures in order to reduce the occurrence of internal neoplasms in koi. "
3,JAK Inhibition Impairs NK Cell Function in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.,"Ruxolitinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the JAK kinases, which has been approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis, a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), but clinical trials are also being conducted in inflammatory-driven solid tumors. Increased infection rates have been reported in ruxolitinib-treated patients, and natural killer (NK) cells are immune effector cells known to eliminate both virus-infected and malignant cells. On this basis, we sought to compare the effects of JAK inhibition on human NK cells in a cohort of 28 MPN patients with or without ruxolitinib treatment and 24 healthy individuals. NK cell analyses included cell frequency, receptor expression, proliferation, immune synapse formation, and cytokine signaling. We found a reduction in NK cell numbers in ruxolitinib-treated patients that was linked to the appearance of clinically relevant infections. This reduction was likely due to impaired maturation of NK cells, as reflected by an increased ratio in immature to mature NK cells. Notably, the endogenous functional defect of NK cells in MPN was further aggravated by ruxolitinib treatment. In vitro data paralleled these in vivo results, showing a reduction in cytokine-induced NK cell activation. Further, reduced killing activity was associated with an impaired capacity to form lytic synapses with NK target cells. Taken together, our findings offer compelling evidence that ruxolitinib impairs NK cell function in MPN patients, offering an explanation for increased infection rates and possible long-term side effects associated with ruxolitinib treatment."
3,Concomitant use of corticosteroids and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with hematologic or solid neoplasms: A systematic review.,"Clinical trials studying immune checkpoint inhibitors exclude patients on corticosteroids, due to the hypothesis that corticosteroids may antagonize immunotherapy. We performed a systematic review of the literature looking at the clinical outcomes of cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and concomitant corticosteroids.The following databases were searched for relevant studies: MEDLINE, Embase Classic+Embase, BIOSIS Previews, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the CENTRAL Registry of Controlled Trials, Web of Science and Scopus. Abstracts from the meetings of the European Cancer Congress/European Society for Medical Oncology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society of Hematology, the European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology, the American Society for Radiation Oncology and the European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology were manually searched. Two independent reviewers screened the references: case reports and articles with a low risk of bias were retained.Following a retrieval of 14603 unique references, 140 abstracts were retained for review; 27 articles are in the final analysis. Although limited, the reviewed data suggests that the concomitant administration of corticosteroids and immune checkpoint inhibitors may not necessarily lead to poorer clinical outcomes.In our systematic review, there was no objective data on the exact types of corticosteroids and the dose threshold above which an interaction could be measured clinically. Consideration of stratified randomization and treatment sequence evaluations in prospective trials may clarify this challenging topic and perhaps improve patient access to immune checkpoint therapies."
3,PET/CT incidental detection of second tumor in patients investigated for pancreatic neoplasms.,"Positron Emission Tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is an imaging technique which has a role in the detection and staging malignancies (both in first diagnosis and follow-up). The finding of an unexpected region of FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) uptake can occur when performing whole-body FDG-PET, raising the possibility of a second primary tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience of second primary cancer incidentally discovered during PET/CT examination performed for pancreatic diseases, during the initial work-up or follow-up after surgical resection.In this study, a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively collected data base was performed. Three hundred ninety- nine patients with pancreatic pathology were evaluated by whole body PET/CT imaging from January 2004 to December 2014. Among them, 348 patients were scanned before surgical resection and 51 during the course of their follow-up (pancreatic cancer). Median follow-up time was 29??months (range 14-124).Fifty-six patients (14%) had incidental uptake of FDG in their organs: 31 patients had focal uptake and 25 showed diffuse with or without focal uptake. All patients with focal uptake were investigated, and invasive malignancy was diagnosed in 22 patients: 14 colon, 4 lung, 1 larynx, 1 urothelial, 1 breast cancer, and 1 colon metastasis from pancreatic cancer. Twenty patients underwent resection, and 6 endoscopic removal of colonic polyps. Three patients were not operated for advanced disease, and two patients did not show any pathology (PET/CT false positive). Of the 10 patients investigated for diffuse uptake, no malignancy was found; none of these patients developed a second cancer during the follow-up.As in other malignancies, unexpected FDG uptake can occur in patients having PET/CT investigation for pancreatic diseases. Focal uptake is likely to be a malignancy and deserves further investigations, although the stage and the poor prognosis of primary pancreatic cancer should be kept in mind. Some selected patients may benefit from the aggressive treatment of incidental lesions and show survival benefit."
3,Secondary Neoplasms in Children Treated for Cancer.,"The survival of children with cancer has improved dramatically in the last decades. Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk of long-term complications of therapeutic exposure. Second malignant neoplasms are one of the most severe side effects of cancer treatment. The frequency and type of secondary cancers may vary depending on the initial diagnosis, treatment administered and genetic predisposition. This review highlights the risk factors in the development of SMNs in survivors of pediatric cancers and their differences according to primary cancer type, genetic predisposition and treatment admistered. Finally, the review emphasizes the need for life-time follow-up of survivors of childhood cancer for the development of second malignancies."
3,Second malignant neoplasms in patients with Cowden syndrome with underlying germline PTEN mutations.,"Patients with Cowden syndrome (CS) with underlying germline PTEN mutations are at increased risk of breast, thyroid, endometrial, and renal cancers. To our knowledge, risk of subsequent cancers in these patients has not been previously explored or quantified.We conducted a 7-year multicenter prospective study (2005 to 2012) of patients with CS or CS-like disease, all of whom underwent comprehensive PTEN mutational analysis. Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) were ascertained by medical records and confirmed by pathology reports. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for all SMNs combined and for breast, thyroid, endometrial, and renal cancers were calculated.Of the 2,912 adult patients included in our analysis, 2,024 had an invasive cancer history. Germline pathogenic PTEN mutations (PTEN mutation positive) were identified in 114 patients (5.6%). Of these 114 patients, 46 (40%) had an SMN. Median age of SMN diagnosis was 50 years (range, 21 to 71 years). Median interval between primary cancer and SMN was 5 years (range, <1 to 35 years). Of the 51 PTEN mutation-positive patients who presented with primary breast cancer, 11 (22%) had a subsequent new primary breast cancer and 10-year second breast cancer cumulative risk of 29% (95% CI, 15.3 to 43.7). Risk of SMNs compared with that of the general population was significantly elevated for all cancers (SIR, 7.74; 95% CI, 5.84 to 10.07), specifically for breast (SIR, 8.92; 95% CI, 5.85 to 13.07), thyroid (SIR, 5.83; 95% CI, 3.01 to 10.18), and endometrial SMNs (SIR, 14.08.07; 95% CI, 7.10 to 27.21).Patients with CS with germline PTEN mutations are at higher risk for SMNs compared with the general population. Prophylactic mastectomy should be considered on an individual basis given the significant risk of subsequent breast cancer."
3,GH replacement therapy and second neoplasms in adult survivors of childhood cancer: a retrospective study from a single institution.,"Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is the most common endocrine late effect observed in childhood cancer survivors (CCS) previously submitted to cranial irradiation. Radiation therapy can also increase the risk of second neoplasms (SNs). Since in previous studies GH replacement therapy was associated with increased incidence of neoplasia, we explored the association between SNs and GH replacement therapy in a cohort of CCS with GHD.Within the clinical cohort of CCS referred to the Transition Unit for Childhood Cancer Survivors of Turin between November 2001 and December 2012, we considered all patients who developed GHD as a consequence of cancer therapies. GHD was always diagnosed in childhood. To evaluate the quality of data, our cohort was linked to the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont.GHD was diagnosed in 49 out of 310 CCS included in our clinical cohort. At least one SN was diagnosed in 14 patients, meningioma and basal cell carcinoma being the most common SNs. The cumulative incidence of SNs was similar in GH-treated and -untreated patients (8 SNs out of 26 GH-treated and 6 out of 23 GH-untreated patients; p??=??0.331). Age, sex and paediatric cancer type had no impact on SNs development.In our CCS, GH replacement therapy does not seem to increase the risk of SNs. Anyway, independently from replacement therapy, in these patients we observed an elevated risk of SNs, possibly related to previous radiation therapy, which suggests the need of a close long-term follow-up."
3,"Identification of Small Proteins and Peptides in the Differentiation of Patients with Intraductal Mucinous Neoplasms of the Pancreas, Chronic Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.","There are a limited number of studies investigating the type of serum proteins capable of differentiating intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms from benign or malignant diseases of the pancreas.To select proteins able to differentiate intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms from benign and malignant pancreatic disease using semiquantitative proteomics.Serum samples were obtained from 74 patients (19 with type II intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, 8 with type I/III intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, 24 with chronic pancreatitis, 23 with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas) and 21 healthy subjects. Small proteins and peptides were assayed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization for the detection of differentially abundant species possibly related to tumor onset. Serum pancreatic amylase, lipase, carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) were also assayed.Twenty-six of 84 peaks detected were dysregulated (7 more abundant and 19 less abundant in the type II intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, p??<??0.05). Of the differentially abundant peaks, 17 were commonly dysregulated (3 peaks more abundant and 13 less abundant in type II intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and one at ??m/z??= 9961 at variance), indicating a protein fingerprint shared by types I/III and type II intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.These results suggest that our approach can be used to differentiate type II intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms from type I/III neoplasms, and type II intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas."
3,Intravenous versus oral etoposide: efficacy and correlation to clinical outcome in patients with high-grade metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (WHO G3).,"High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs, G3) are aggressive cancers of the digestive system with poor prognosis and survival. Platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin/carboplatin?€?+?€?etoposide) is considered the first-line palliative treatment. Etoposide is frequently administered intravenously; however, oral etoposide may be used as an alternative. Concerns for oral etoposide include decreased bioavailability, inter- and intra-patient variability and patient compliance. We aimed to evaluate possible differences in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with oral etoposide compared to etoposide given as infusion. Patients (n?€?=?€?236) from the Nordic NEC study were divided into three groups receiving etoposide as a long infusion (24??h, n?€?=?€?170), short infusion (????€?5??h, n?€?=?€?33) or oral etoposide (n?€?=?€?33) according to hospital tradition. PFS and OS were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier (log-rank), cox proportional hazard ratios and confidence intervals. No statistical differences were observed in PFS or OS when comparing patients receiving long infusion (median PFS 3.8??months, median OS 14.5??months), short infusion (PFS 5.6??months, OS 11.0??months) or oral etoposide (PFS 5.4??months, OS 11.3??months). We observed equal efficacy for the three administration routes suggesting oral etoposide may be safe and efficient in treating high-grade GEP-NEN, G3 patients scheduled for cisplatin/carboplatin?€?+?€?etoposide therapy."
3,"Functional interdependence of hematopoietic stem cells and their niche in oncogene promotion of myeloproliferative neoplasms: the 159th biomedical version of ""it takes two to tango"".","The role of stem cells in normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis is well established. However, neither normal nor neoplastic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop in isolation and accumulating evidence indicates that a critical developmental role is played by the perivascular ""niche."" The cellular, humoral, and cell surface contacts that provide the proper environment for HSC survival, proliferation, and differentiation are becoming increasingly better understood. A number of studies have established that endothelial cells (ECs), several types of perivascular stromal cells, and megakaryocytes (MKs) provide several cell surface and secreted molecules required for HSC development. Accumulating evidence also indicates that the normal stem cell niche is altered in patients with hematological neoplasms and that the ""neoplastic niche"" plays an important role in promoting malignant and suppressing normal blood cell development in such patients. To explore this concept in the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), we employed a murine model to determine the effects of Jak2V<sub>617</sub>F, an oncogene found in a majority of such patients, in marrow ECs and MKs and their effect on promoting neoplastic and suppressing normal hematopoiesis. We found that Jak2V<sub>617</sub>F has profound effects on both cell types, which together are critical for the growth advantage and radioresistance shown by Jak2V<sub>617</sub>F-bearing HSCs. Such findings should provide new approaches to the treatment of patients with MPNs."
3,Ki67 labeling index: assessment and prognostic role in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.,"In 1983, a monoclonal antibody, Ki67, was generated, that labeled the nuclei of proliferating non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells. The name Ki67 derived from the city of Kiel (Ki) where the antibody was produced in the university department of pathology and refers to the number of the original clone (67). Systematic assessment of the proliferative activity of tumors using Ki67 started in the 1990s, when Ki67, which only worked on frozen tissue, was complemented by the antibody MIB-1 that also worked in formalin-fixed tissues. Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) were the first endocrine tumors whose proliferative activity was assessed with Ki67. This approach was so successful that Ki67 was included as prognostic marker in the 2000 and 2004 WHO classifications of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs). In 2010, the WHO classification of GEP-NENs introduced a three-tiered grading, originally proposed by ENETS in 2006 that was mainly based on the Ki67 index. As it has subsequently been shown that the Ki67 index is the most reliable factor in the prognostic evaluation of GEP-NENs, especially of PanNENs, the 2017 WHO classification of PanNENs requires its use and strongly recommends exact assessment of the proportion Ki67-labeled cells as basis for the calculation of the Ki67 index. Problems in assessing the Ki67 index include intertumoral and intratumoral staining heterogeneity and counting methods. Despite such problems, the Ki67 index has emerged as indispensable for the prognostic and therapeutic stratification of the majority of GEP-NENs and can barely be replaced by counting mitoses. In future, however, it can be anticipated that the Ki67 cut-offs experience refinement in relation to the type of tumor, its location, and its response to therapy. It is also possible that the prognostic risk of an individual tumor is calculated for each Ki67 unit and not for an ""a priori"" fixed Ki67 class."
3,Flow cytometry identification of nonhemopoietic neoplasms during routine immunophenotyping.,"Nonhemopoietic neoplasms (NHNs) may be encountered during routine flow cytometry (FC) immunophenotyping. The clue of their presence mainly relies on detection of CD45-negative (CD45-) cells with altered scatter parameters.In this study, we evaluated a monoclonal antibody combination conceived to characterize the CD45- population by FC, suspected of belonging to NHNs, when present. The panel included CD45 for leucocytes identification, CD326 (clones BerEP4 and HEA-125) to mark epithelial cells, CD33 to identify myeloid cells, CD138 to trace plasma cells and CD56 useful in the identification of neuroendocrine tumours. 7AAD vital dye was used to gate out dead cells. Results were correlated with cytomorphology and confirmed by histological data, if available.Among 9422 specimens submitted for routine FC investigation, 47 samples that included fine-needle aspirates, bone marrow aspirates, tissue biopsies and body fluids had a detectable CD45- population and a sufficient cell amount to be further investigated. FC revealed the presence of CD326-positive epithelial cells in 38 specimens; altered scatter parameters and variable reactivity to the other antigens tested allowed to suspect NHNs in the remaining nine samples. The presence of NHNs was confirmed in all cases by morphology.The current results show that when CD45- cells with altered scatter parameters were detected, cytometrists involved in leukaemia/lymphoma diagnosis may require further FC investigations to rapidly identify NHNs in different specimens, thus reducing the time of the immunohistochemical diagnostic workup to reach a final diagnosis."
3,Incidental Gynecologic Tract Neoplasms in Women Undergoing Anterior Pelvic Exenteration for Urothelial Carcinoma.,"Urothelial carcinoma (UC) invasive into the muscularis propria or tumors unresponsive to treatment are indications for cystectomy. In females, with the goal of achieving complete cancer eradication and for concerns of UC extension into the adjacent pelvic organs, this may also warrant resection of the gynecologic organs. This study is aimed to assess the prevalence of unanticipated gynecologic neoplasms in anterior pelvic exenteration specimens. A retrospective review of pathology reports to identify women undergoing anterior pelvic exenteration for UC was performed (N=221), and incidentally discovered gynecologic tract neoplasms were recorded. Concomitant malignant or premalignant lesions of the gynecologic tract were identified in 8 patients (3.6%). These included endometrial adenocarcinoma [endometrioid type, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade 1 (n=2, 0.9%)], cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (n=2, 0.9%), Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor of intermediate differentiation (n=1, 0.5%), endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the ovary (n=1, 0.5%), and high-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary (n=1, 0.5%) and fallopian tube (n=1, 0.5%). Benign uterine neoplasms included leiomyomas (n=81, 37%), adenomyoma (n=3, 1.4%), and adenomatoid tumors (n=2, 0.9%). Benign ovarian neoplasms included serous cystadenoma (n=7, 3%), serous cystadenofibroma (n=4, 2%), benign Brenner tumor (n=5, 2.3%), mature teratoma (n=4, 2%), stromal luteoma (n=2, 0.9%), mucinous cystadenoma (n=1, 0.5%), thecoma (n=1, 0.5%), and endometrioid cystadenoma (n=1, 0.5%). Involvement of the gynecologic tract by UC was identified in 11 patients (5%). Spread of UC to the reproductive organs is rare in anterior pelvic exenteration specimens. Coexisting neoplasms of the gynecologic tract are occasionally identified, therefore careful evaluation of these organs is necessary."
3,Urothelial neoplasms in pediatric and young adult patients: A large single-center series.,"Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, but is exceedingly rare in young patients, leading to a lack of accepted standards for diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance. We review our institutional experience with bladder urothelial neoplasms in pediatric and young adult patients summarizing presentation, treatment, and outcomes.Surgical pathology records at our institution were searched for cases of urothelial neoplasms among patients ???25 years of age treated between January 1997 and September 2016. Cases submitted exclusively for pathology review were excluded. Diagnoses were confirmed based on pathologic examination using the 2004 World Health Organization classification system.Thirty-four patients were identified with a mean age of 21.1 years (range 8-25 years), and median follow-up was 25.1 months (1-187 months). The male to female ratio was 1.83:1. The most common presenting symptom was hematuria (n=26; 76%). Diagnoses were invasive urothelial carcinoma (n=3), noninvasive urothelial carcinoma (n=24), PUNLMP (n=6), and urothelial papilloma (n=1). Noninvasive lesions were resected by cystoscopy, after which 12% (n=4) experienced complications (grade II or greater). One patient with stage IV invasive disease at diagnosis died, and 2 patients developed recurrences. Of those with noninvasive carcinoma, 29% (n=7) required repeat cystoscopy soon after initial TURBT at outside institutions, and 17% (n=4) had tumors downgraded from high-grade to low-grade after pathology review.Hematuria is the most common sign of bladder neoplasia in children and young adults and should be investigated by cystoscopy. The majority of urothelial neoplasms in these patients are noninvasive and can be successfully treated with transurethral resection.Level IV (Retrospective study with no comparison group)."
3,Good performance of platinum-based chemotherapy for high-grade gastroenteropancreatic and unknown primary neuroendocrine neoplasms.,"To evaluate efficacy and safety of platinum and etoposide combination in the treatment of advanced gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) and unknown primary (CUP) neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC), we analysed the records of 21 consecutive patients treated with this regimen from 1999 to 2012. Objective responses were obtained in 11 patients (52%) and disease stability (DS) in 5 (24%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7??months (95% CI, 5.33-8.66). Median overall survival (OS) was 16??months (95% CI, 14.97-17.03). Patients with limited liver disease had a significantly (p??=??0.002) better PFS than patients with extrahepatic disease at diagnosis with 9??months (95% CI, 7.14-10.85) vs. 4??months (95% CI, 1.60-6.40). Two patients experienced durable complete response (30 and 90??months). The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (61%), anaemia (50%), nausea and vomiting (27%) and fatigue (22%). The platinum plus etoposide regimen has an acceptable toxicity profile and is effective in patients with GEP and CUP-NECs."
3,A monocentric retrospective study of 138 therapy-related myeloid neoplasms.,"As diagnosing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) is often challenging, we reviewed clinicopathological features of t-MN patients. Medical records of 138 patients, diagnosed with t-MN between 1995 and 2017, were reviewed. Of 138 patients, 80 had t-MDS, 53 t-AML, and 5 t-MDS/MPN (age, 22-88??years; median 64??years; male/female ratio, 0.8). The median latency time was 6??years and 5??months. Of 115 patients, 56 patients received cytotoxic-/radiotherapy for a solid tumor, 56 for hematological malignancy, and 3 for an auto-immune disorder, respectively. Another 21 patients had a combination of 2 disorders. Moreover, 2 patients had 3 previous malignancies. Breast cancer was the most prevalent tumor, followed by low-grade B non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Immunophenotyping and immunohistochemistry showed aberrant expression of B-, T-, or NK-cell markers in 21% and 6%, respectively. In 90% of the patients, dysplasia in ????€?1 lineage was found. KMT2A fusion gene transcripts were seen in 5%. Cytogenetic analysis showed complex karyotypes (31%) and chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities (40%). Almost 82% of the patients died and the median overall survival was about 1??year. Our study confirms that previous therapy for breast cancer is the most important cause of t-MN. KMT2A fusion genes are prevalent and complex karyotypes and/or chromosomes 5 and/or 7 abnormalities are common."
3,Myeloproliferative Neoplasms With Calreticulin Mutations Exhibit Distinctive Morphologic Features.,"Calreticulin (CALR) mutations are present in 50% to 85% of JAK2/MPL wild-type (wt) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The histopathologic features of CALR-mutated MPNs are unknown.We identified 71 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-ET MF) with available CALR status. CALR was assessed using capillary electrophoresis followed by Sanger sequencing confirmation. CALR status was correlated with histopathologic features.The megakaryocytes of CALR-mutated PMF more often were hyperchromatic (20/21) compared with CALR-wt cases (10/14) (P = .05). CALR-mutated ET showed more megakaryocytic clustering (7/7) compared with CALR-wt cases (5/9) (P = 03). Megakaryocytes of CALR-mutated post-ET MF (8/8) had a predominance of convoluted nuclei compared with CALR-wt cases (2/4) (P = .03). CALR mutations were more frequent in post-ET MF compared with ET (P = .04).CALR-mutated MPNs have a higher frequency of megakaryocytic aberrancies compared with CALR-wt cases. Patients with CALR-mutated ET appear to be more likely to develop myelofibrosis compared with patients with wt CALRUpon completion of this activity you will be able to: describe morphologic features that are associated with CALR-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms.examine cases of essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis and predict which cases are more likely to be CALR-mutated based on histopathologic features.initiate CALR mutation testing for cases likely to have mutations. ?€?The ASCP is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.

3,The Risk of Second Primary Colorectal Adenocarcinomas Is Not Increased among Patients with Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.,"Second primary colorectal adenocarcinomas (SPCA) may occur with a higher frequency in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs). In a nationwide population-based study, we investigated the risk of SPCA in GEP-NEN patients and compared it to the general population.Using the nationwide Danish registries, we identified 2,831 GEP-NEN patients (median age 63 years [IQR 50-73 years], 53% women) diagnosed in 1995-2010. We used Cox regression to compare the incidence of SPCA in GEP-NEN patients relative to a gender- and age-matched general population sample of 56,044 persons.We observed 20 SPCAs among the 2,831 GEP-NEN patients with a total time at risk of 14,003 years (incidence = 143 per 100,000 person-years) and 770 colorectal adenocarcinomas in the general population of 56,044 persons with a total time at risk of 466,801 years (incidence = 165 per 100,000 person-years). The hazard ratio (HR) of SPCA from GEP-NEN diagnosis to the end of follow-up was 1.22 (95% CI: 0.78-1.92) in GEP-NEN patients compared to the general population. This nonsignificant association was the result of a strong positive association in the first 6 months after diagnosis of GEP-NEN (HR = 9.43 [95% CI: 4.98-17.86]) followed by a negative association in the remainder of the follow-up period (HR = 0.50 [95% CI: 0.20-1.21]).In this population-based study, there was no increased risk of SPCA among GEP-NEN patients. The clinical workup in newly diagnosed GEP-NEN patients likely explains the positive short-term association followed by a negative association."
3,Role of Alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin and Fibroblast Activation Protein Alpha in Ovarian Neoplasms.,"Studies show that tumor growth is not just determined by the presence of malignant cells, since interactions between cancer cells and stromal microenvironment have important impacts on the cancer growth and progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts play a prominent role in this process. The aims of the study were to investigate 2 cancer-associated fibroblasts markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin (??-SMA), and fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) in the stromal microenvironment of benign and malignant ovarian epithelial neoplasms, and to relate their tissue expression with prognostic factors in ovarian cancer.??-SMA and FAP were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in malignant (n = 28) and benign (n = 28) ovarian neoplasms. Fisher's exact test was used with a significance level lower than 0.05.FAP immunostaining was stronger??in ovarian cancer when compared to benign neoplasms (p = 0.0366). There was no significant difference in relation to ??-SMA expression between malignant and benign ovarian neoplasms as well as prognostic factors. In ovarian cancer, FAP stainings 2/3 was significantly related to histological grades 2 and 3 (p = 0.0183).FAP immunostaining is more intense in malignant neoplasms than in benign ovarian neoplasms, as well as in moderately differentiated and undifferentiated ovarian carcinomas compared to well-differentiated neoplasms, thus indicating that it can be used as a marker of worse prognosis."
3,"Nine primary malignant neoplasms-involving the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, prostate, and external ear canal-without microsatellite instability: a case report.","Although cases of multiple primary malignant neoplasms are increasing, reports of more than three or four primary metachronous malignant neoplasms are extremely rare. Moreover, very few publications have provided a genetic mutational analysis or have evaluated risk factors associated with such neoplasms. We present an extremely rare case of nine primary malignant lesions in a man who was successfully treated. We also report on microsatellite stability status, analyze risk factors, and discuss the relevant literature.Between 67 and 73??years of age, a male patient developed nine primary metachronous malignant lesions: Three were located in the esophagus, two in the stomach, two in the colorectum, one in the prostate gland, and one in the external ear canal. The patient's clinical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, an acoustic schwannoma, and heavy smoking. The lesions were diagnosed during regular screening over a six-year period. He was successfully treated with surgery (both open surgical and endoscopic resection of lesions) and adjuvant chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry and mutational analysis showed that the lesions were microsatellite stable, and the KRAS, BRAF, p53, and nuclear ??-catenin status was not uniform among the lesions.Given that the presence of more than three or four neoplasms is extremely rare, the present case of nine primary malignancies with no associated microsatellite instability and no apparent predisposing hereditary conditions, is extraordinary. Our case study shows that it is possible for up to nine sporadic neoplasms to occur, and efficient disease management requires diligent screening and early detection."
3,"Histiocytic cell neoplasms involving the bone marrow: summary of the workshop cases submitted to the 18th Meeting of the European Association for Haematopathology (EAHP) organized by the European Bone Marrow Working Group, Basel 2016.","The bone marrow is a preferential site for both reactive and neoplastic histiocytic proliferations. The differential diagnosis ranges from reactive histiocyte hyperplasia in systemic infections, vaccinations, storage diseases, post myeloablative therapy, due to increased cell turnover, and in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, through extranodal Rosai-Dorfman disease to neoplasms derived from histiocytes, including histiocytic sarcomas (HS), Langerhans cell histiocytoses (LCH), Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), and disseminated juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG). One of the most important recent developments in understanding the biology of histiocytic neoplasms and in contributing to diagnosis was the detection of recurrent mutations of genes of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, in particular the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation, in LCH and ECD. Here, we summarize clinical and pathological findings of 17 histiocytic neoplasms that were presented during the bone marrow symposium and workshop of the 18th European Association for Haematopathology (EAHP) meeting held in Basel, Switzerland, in 2016. A substantial proportion of these histiocytic neoplasms was combined with clonally related lymphoid (n?€?=?€?2) or myeloid diseases (n?€?=?€?5, all ECD). Based on the latter observation, we suggest excluding co-existent myeloid neoplasms at initial staging of elderly ECD patients. The recurrent nature of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway mutations in histiocytic neoplasms was confirmed in 6 of the 17 workshop cases, illustrating their diagnostic significance and suggesting apotential target for tailored treatments."
3,Primary Cutaneous Follicle Center Lymphoma Clear Cell Variant: Expanding the Spectrum of Cutaneous Clear Cell Neoplasms.,"Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma is the most frequent cutaneous B-cell lymphoma despite the fact that is an uncommon disease. Mild biological behavior and good prognosis characterized this neoplasm with a low aggressiveness compared with classic nodal follicular lymphoma (FL). Rare histological variants have been described. We present the case of a 72-year-old man who underwent surgery for a cutaneous nodule on his left scapula. The biopsy showed a dermal clear cell proliferation arranged in a nodular and diffuse pattern. The cells stained positive for CD20 and Bcl-6 supporting B-cell follicular differentiation. The final diagnosis was ""primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma"" with ""clear cell changes"" according to the 2016 World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms. Additional tests to rule out a systemic involvement were performed. The prognosis was favorable with a disease-free survival of 7 years after complete surgical excision. It has been assumed that cutaneous tumors composed of clear cells may have an epithelial, melanocytic, adnexal, mesenchymal, or metastatic origin. The correct histopathological diagnosis required immunohistochemistry and even molecular techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a cutaneous clear cell lymphoma and of a FL with clear cell features. Our findings provide evidence that the heterogeneity of FL is greater than previously thought and expand the spectrum of differential diagnosis in cutaneous clear cell neoplasms. Dermatopathologists should be aware of this entity and should comprise a PanB marker in their first- or second-line immunohistochemistry for the correct diagnosis of a dermal clear cell proliferation."
3,Imaging and Cytopathological Criteria Indicating Malignancy in Mucin-Producing Pancreatic Neoplasms: A Series of 68 Histopathologically Confirmed Cases.,"This study aims to evaluate the performance of clinical, imaging, and cytopathological criteria in the identification of high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma (HGD/Ca) in pancreatic mucin-producing cystic neoplasms.Sixty-eight consecutive, histopathologically confirmed mucin-producing cystic neoplasms, evaluated by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, were enrolled; specifically, 39 branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs), 21 main duct IPMNs, and 8 mucinous cystic neoplasms. The associations between HGD/Ca in histopathology and findings of endoscopic ultrasound and cytology, demographic, lifestyle, and clinical parameters were evaluated, separately in IPMNs and mucinous cystic neoplasms.Age 65 years or more was associated with HGD/Ca in IPMNs. In BD-IPMNs, cyst diameter 3 cm or greater (sensitivity, 68.8%; specificity, 65.2%), a mural nodule (sensitivity, 56.3%; specificity, 78.3%), main pancreatic duct diameter 5 to 9 mm (sensitivity, 50.0%; specificity, 87.0%), and suspicious cytology (sensitivity, 81.3%; specificity, 100%) signaled the presence of HGD/Ca. Similarly, in main duct IPMNs, suspicious cytology predicted HGD/Ca with high sensitivity (88.9%) and excellent specificity (100%). Regarding cytopathological criteria, in BD-IPMNs, HGD/Ca was associated with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, background necrosis, presence of papillary structures, hypochromatic nuclei, hyperchromatic nuclei, and major nuclear membrane irregularities (thickening and/or indentations).Clinical, imaging, and cytopathological criteria are useful in the identification of HGD/Ca in IPMNs."
3,Mobile phone use and risk of brain neoplasms and other cancers: prospective study.,"Results from some retrospective studies suggest a possible increased risk of glioma and acoustic neuroma in users of mobile phones.The relation between mobile phone use and incidence of intracranial central nervous system (CNS) tumours and other cancers was examined in 791,710 middle-aged women in a UK prospective cohort, the Million Women Study. Cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Women reported mobile phone use in 1999 to 2005 and again in 2009.During 7 years' follow-up, 51,680 incident invasive cancers and 1,261 incident intracranial CNS tumours occurred. Risk among ever vs never users of mobile phones was not increased for all intracranial CNS tumours (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.90-1.14, P = 0.82), for specified CNS tumour types nor for cancer at 18 other specified sites. For long-term users compared with never users, there was no appreciable association for glioma (10+ years: RR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.55-1.10, P = 0.16) or meningioma (10+ years: RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.66-1.84, P = 0.71). For acoustic neuroma, there was an increase in risk with long term use vs never use (10+ years: RR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.07-5.64, P = 0.03), the risk increasing with duration of use (trend among users, P = 0.03).In this large prospective study, mobile phone use was not associated with increased incidence of glioma, meningioma or non-CNS cancers."
3,LEF-1: Diagnostic utility in distinguishing basaloid neoplasms of the salivary gland.,"Lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF-1) has recently been reported as a potential immunohistochemical (IHC) marker for basal cell adenoma (BCA) and other salivary gland tumors, which may contribute to an increased accuracy in differentiating basaloid salivary gland neoplasms. We evaluated the utility of LEF-1 in fine needle aspiration (FNA) and resection specimens to distinguish pleomorphic adenoma (PA), BCA, basal cell adenocarcinoma (BCAC), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) as well as in non-neoplastic salivary gland (NNSG).Cases including 66 PA (35 FNA, 31 resections), 12 BCA (5 FNA, 7 resections), 42 ACC (11 FNA, 31 resections), 1 BCAC FNA, and 10 NNSG (5 FNA, 5 resections) were obtained and stained for LEF-1.On cell block (CB), 51% of PA and 60% of BCA were LEF-1 positive while 91% of ACC were LEF-1 negative. Among resections, there was a higher percentage of LEF-1 positive PA (84%) and BCA (86%), and a higher percentage of LEF-1 negative ACC (97%). LEF-1 staining had a low to moderate sensitivity for detecting benign basaloid neoplasms on FNA CB and resection specimens (52.5% and 84%, respectively), but a higher specificity (92% and 97% respectively), and positive predictive value (95% and 97% respectively).When comparing benign (PA and BCA) and the most common malignant basaloid salivary gland tumor (ACC), positive LEF-1 favors a benign neoplasm. Additional studies with LEF-1, specifically including other rare basaloid salivary gland neoplasms are needed to further clarify the role of LEF-1 in diagnosing these lesions on FNA."
3,"The histopathological classification, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of mucinous appendiceal neoplasms, appendiceal adenocarcinomas and pseudomyxoma peritonei.","The vermiform appendix is the primary site of several distinctive benign and malignant neoplasms. Some can produce the clinical syndrome of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). A consensus on their terminology was reached by an international panel of pathologists and clinicians working under the auspices of the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International (PSOGI), and this review discusses the application of the PSOGI classification to routine reporting. We discuss diagnosis and differential diagnosis together with implications for patient management, covering low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms, high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms, serrated polyps, adenomas and adenocarcinomas. We do not cover goblet cell tumours or neuroendocrine neoplasms in this paper."
3,The Use of Biomarkers in the Risk Stratification of Cystic Neoplasms.,"Cyst fluid biomarkers may be used to identify pancreatic cyst subtypes. Biomarkers are selected based on their ability to accurately distinguish mucinous from nonmucinous cysts and to risk stratify cysts based on malignant potential. Biomarkers of interest include but are not limited to amylase, oncogenes, DNA analysis, and epigenetic markers. The introduction of next-generation sequencing and molecular panels has aided in improved diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification. This review presents the diagnostic performance of currently available biomarkers and proposes an algorithm to incorporate their use in the diagnosis of pancreatic cysts."
3,Flow Cytometry of Nonhematopoietic Neoplasms.,"Many epithelial neoplasms can be analyzed by flow cytometry (FC), particularly from serous cavity effusion samples, using EpCAM, a cell adhesion molecule expressed on most normal epithelial cells and expressed at a higher level in most epithelial neoplasms. A simple 3-color flow cytometric panel can provide a high sensitivity and specificity compared to cytomorphology. FC provides more rapid immunophenotyping than conventional immunohistochemical staining, can identify rare malignant cells that could be missed by a cytological exam alone, and can be utilized to evaluate limited samples such as cerebrospinal fluid or fine-needle aspiration samples. Flow cytometric analysis for epithelial antigens can be combined with DNA ploidy analysis or assessment of the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. Panels of flow cytometric markers are useful for the assessment of pediatric nonhematopoietic neoplasms, including neuroblastomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcomas, germ cell tumors, and hemangiopericytomas, as well as small-round-blue-cell tumors in adults, including small-cell carcinomas."
3,The mutational frequency of BRAF and KRAS in low-grade serous testicular neoplasms-a case series.,"Low-grade serous neoplasms of the testis are rare neoplasms that show striking morphological similarities with the better-understood ovarian neoplasms. This study is to see if there are similar molecular abnormalities in these two tumours. The cell of origin, relationship with serous ovarian tumour and the pathogenesis of these neoplasms are not fully established.As low-grade serous ovarian neoplasms are known to harbour mutations in the MAPK pathway, we investigated the involvement of BRAF and KRAS mutations in low-grade testicular serous tumour by performing mutational analysis of seven cases. Mutational analysis was performed by melting curve analysis followed by bidirectional sequencing. Our findings showed BRAF and/or KRAS mutations in three of the seven cases, which is similar to the proportions reported in low-grade ovarian serous neoplasms. Of these three cases, one showed co-mutation of BRAF and KRAS.The findings of this study are in support of a role of aberrant signalling of the MAPK pathway in the pathogenesis of low-grade serous testicular neoplasms, and provide a genetic link between low-grade testicular and ovarian serous tumours."
3,IMP3 expression in small-intestine neuroendocrine neoplasms: a new predictor of recurrence.,"Small-intestine neuroendocrine neoplasms are heterogeneous neoplasms arising from endocrine cells of the intestinal mucosa. Ki-67 is the main determinant of prognosis in neuroendocrine neoplasms. However, the search for new prognostic makers represents a key point with regard to small-intestine neuroendocrine neoplasms. The oncofetal protein IMP3 plays a role in cell growth and its expression has a prognostic value in lung neoplasms.From January 1998 to August 2015, all the consecutive small-intestine neuroendocrine neoplasms patients suitable for surgery were included: 51 patients (32 males, median age 68 years) had small-intestine neuroendocrine neoplasms classified according to the WHO 2010 classification. In all the cases IMP3 expression was evaluated on primary tumors and, when available, on nodal and distant metastases. The medical records and pathological slides of these patients were used to determine the clinical characteristics, pathological diagnoses, and outcome information.The overall 5-year and 10-year survival rate were 53.9 and 42% respectively. At Cox proportional hazards regression grading was the major factor influencing both OS and progression-free survival at univariate (p?€?=?€?0.0002 and 0.0051, respectively) and multivariate analysis (p?€?=?€?0.0004 and 0.0043, respectively). Also IMP3 expression at the nodal metastases resulted a factor significantly associated with progression-free survival at both univariate (p?€?=?€?0.0066) and multivariate analysis (p?€?=?€?0.0059, HR 3.58). IMP3 expression did not correlate with the Ki-67 (p?€?=?€?n.s.).In this study, IMP3 at the nodal site resulted to be associated with low progression-free survival in small-intestine neuroendocrine neoplasms, independently of the Ki-67 index. We suggest that the integration of IMP3 and Ki-67 would help better stratify the risk of progression in small-intestine neuroendocrine neoplasms."
3,Evaluation of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms with a new classification system and literature review.,"Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms constitute a diagnostic spectrum ranging from adenoma to mucinous adenocarcinoma. To date, many classification systems have been proposed to reflect the histomorphological diversity of neoplasms in this range and their clinical correspondence, and also to form a common terminology between the pathologist and clinicians. The aim of this review is to provide an updated perspective on the pathological features of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. Using the 2016 Modified Delphi Consensus Protocol (Delphi) and the Eighth Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 19 cases presented from June 2011 to December 2016 were evaluated and diagnosed with appendiceal mucinous neoplasia. According to the Delphi, non-carcinoid epithelial tumours of the appendix were categorized in eight histomorphological architectural groups. These groups are adenoma, serrated polyp, low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm, high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm, mucinous adenocarcinoma, poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet-ring, signet-ring cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The most common symptom was right lower quadrant pain. The median age of these cases was 60??15 years. There was a preponderance of females (F/M: 15/4). In our re-evaluation, six cases were diagnosed as serrated polyp. There were 11 cases in the LAMN group and two cases in the mucinous adenocarcinoma group. Using the Delphi and the AJCC manual, there were many changes in the classification, evaluation and treatment of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. These classification systems have facilitated the compatibility and communication of clinicians and pathologists and have guided clinicians on treatment methods."
3,The impact of pre-resection endoscopic examination time on the rate of synchronous gastric neoplasms missed during endoscopic treatment.,"Synchronous multiple gastric cancers have been reported in up to 14% of patients, but few efforts have been made to optimize techniques for detection of multiple neoplasms. We sought to evaluate whether the length of endoscopic examination before endoscopic resection affected the detection rates of synchronous gastric neoplasms.Among patients referred for endoscopic treatment of gastric neoplasms (n?€?=?€?1,017), we enrolled those in whom at least one other synchronous neoplasm was found during pre-resection endoscopy or during the 1-year follow-up examination. Pre-resection endoscopic examination time was compared between those in whom multiple neoplasms were completely diagnosed before resection (complete examination group) and those in whom multiple neoplasms were not fully diagnosed prior to resection but were found during follow-up evaluation (incomplete examination group).Eighty-three patients were included in the study. We found no significant difference in any of the multiplicity, location, gross appearance, size, or resection type of primary lesion between the complete (n???€?=???€?46) and incomplete examination (n???€?=?€?37) groups. The complete examination group had a significantly longer examination time compared to the incomplete examination group (6.5?€????€?2.4??min vs. 3.8?€????€?1.8??min, respectively; P?€?<?€?0.001). The synchronous lesions most commonly presented as the flat type (42/94 lesions, 45%) and were smaller than the primary lesions (10.0?€????€?7.4??mm vs. 14.3?€????€?9.1??mm, respectively; P?€?=?€?0.002).Endoscopists should consider the possibility of synchronous gastric neoplasms and examine the whole stomach, thus allowing adequate time to reduce the risk of missed lesions."
3,Influence of Demographic Factors on Standardised Rate Ratio of Age-adjusted Mortality Rates of Men in Comparison with Women Caused by Neoplasms and Circulatory System Diseases in Slovak Regions during 1996-2013.,"The aim of our study was to find statistical associations including trends of standardised rate ratio of age-adjusted mortality rates for the male population as compared to the female population, in relation to available demographic factors (Chapter II - Neoplasms vs. Chapter IX - Diseases of the circulatory system, Slovak region and calendar year of death).Dataset of individual cases of death in Slovakia with some demographic factors during 1996-2013 were provided by Slovak National Health Information Center. We used regression and correlation analyses, as well as analyses of variance and covariance along with descriptive statistics.The standardised rate ratio of age adjusted mortality rates of men versus age-adjusted mortality rates of women differs between Chapter II and Chapter IX (mean 2.08 vs. 1.35, p<0.001). There are also significant differences of standardised rate ratio among regions (p<0.05). Trends show that the standardised rate ratio has significant regional decline for Chapter II: Ko??ice (p<0.01), Tren????n (p<0.001) and ??ilina (p<0.05) whereas in Chapter IX ??ilina region (p<0.01) is implicated. In other Slovak regions standardised rate ratio stagnates.Standardised rate ratios of age-adjusted mortality rates for the male population compared to the female population are significantly dependent on chapter, sex and region. Standardised rate ratios either decline or stagnate."
3,Clinical application of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HYNIC-TOC SPECT/CT in diagnosing and monitoring of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.,"Our aim of this research was to determine the value of SPECT/CT with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HYNIC-TOC for evaluation of the pancreatic masses which were suspected as neuroendocrine neoplasms and follow-up of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.We retrospectively analyzed 184 patients who performed <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HYNIC-TOC SPECT/CT. All the patients were divided into two groups: one for assessment of diagnostic efficiency for pancreatic suspected masses (n?€?=?€?140) and another for monitoring recurrence after surgery (n?€?=?€?44). The image findings acquired at 2??h postinjection were compared to final diagnoses from pathological results and clinical follow-up. Then, the correlation between ratios of tumor-to-background (TBR) and tumor grade was analyzed.In group 1, 95/140 (67.9%) patients were confirmed as neuroendocrine neoplasms including 85 neuroendocrine tumors and 10 neuroendocrine carcinomas. Patient-based analysis showed that the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of diagnosing neuroendocrine neoplasms with SPECT/CT were 81.1, 84.4 and 82.1%. There was significant difference of TBRs among G1, G2 and G3 (F?€?=?€?3.175, P?€?=?€?0.048). In group 2, 22/44 (50.0%) patients occurred metastasis mainly in liver. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of monitoring recurrence were 87.0, 100 and 93.2%.<sup>99m</sup>Tc-HYNIC-TOC SPECT/CT is a reliable method of diagnosing and monitoring of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, especially neuroendocrine tumors."
3,CD200 Expression in Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.,"CD200 expression has been well studied in hematopoietic malignancies; however, CD200 expression has not been well-characterized in neuroendocrine neoplasms. We examined CD200 expression in 391 neuroendocrine neoplasms from various anatomic sites.Tissue blocks containing pulmonary small cell carcinoma, pulmonary carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, gastrointestinal carcinoid, and Merkel cell carcinoma were evaluated for CD200 expression by immunohistochemistry. A set of nonneuroendocrine carcinomas was stained for comparison.CD200 was expressed in 87% of the neuroendocrine neoplasms studied, including 60 of 72 (83%) pulmonary small cell carcinomas, 15 of 22 (68%) pulmonary carcinoids, three of four (75%) pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, 125 of 146 (86%) Merkel cell carcinomas, 79 of 83 (95%) gastrointestinal luminal carcinoids, and 56 of 60 (93%) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Thirty-two of 157 (20%) nonneuroendocrine carcinomas expressed CD200. In gastrointestinal carcinoid and pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, CD200 negativity correlated with higher grade.CD200 is a relatively sensitive marker of neuroendocrine neoplasms and represents a potential therapeutic target in these difficult-to-treat malignancies."
3,Naturally occurring neoplasms in pigeons in a research colony: a retrospective study.,"This study reports the gross and microscopic pathology of naturally occurring neoplasms in adult pigeons that were presented for necropsy at the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory from 2001 to 2011. The study population consisted of white carneau and mixed-breed pigeons used in behavioral studies in the Department of Psychological Sciences at Purdue University. Twelve types of neoplasms or proliferative disorders were identified in 28 of 83 pigeons (33.7%). Five pigeons had two or three types of neoplasms-proliferative disorders. Of the 83 pigeons, 11 (13.3%) had seminoma, five (6.0%) had thyroid adenoma, four (4.8%) had lymphoma, four (4.8%) had adenocarcinoma of female reproductive tract origin, two (2.4%) had pulmonary carcinoma, and two (2.4%) had cutaneous vascular hamartomas. Also identified were single incidences of dysgerminoma, mesothelioma, liposarcoma, cloacal papilloma, cloacal adenocarcinoma, and gizzard carcinoma. The most frequently occurring tumor was seminoma; 7/11 cases effaced both testicles and 3/11 cases had metastasis to the liver or kidney. The relatively high prevalence of neoplasms in pigeons in the present study is most likely related to the advanced ages of pigeons kept in the research colony."
3,Prevalence of Extrapancreatic Malignancies Among Patients With Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms of the Pancreas.,"We conducted a study in order to assess the prevalence of extrapancreatic malignancies (EPMs) in a cohort of patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) from northeastern Italy.A study was conducted in hospital Santa Maria della Misericordia, Udine, Italy. Hospital records were screened in order to identify newly diagnosed IPMN cases in the period from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2015. We searched for EPMs diagnosed previous to, synchronous to, or after the IPMN. The ratio of the observed (O) number of patients with EPMs to the expected (E) was calculated.We identified 72 EPMs in 63 (31.8%) of 198 patients included. Among them, 51 (70.8%) were diagnosed previous to, 17 (23.6%) synchronous to, and 4 (5.6%) after the IPMN. Most frequently diagnosed were colorectal (12 patients [6.1%]), breast (8 patients [6.8%, in females]), renal cell (8 patients [4.0%]), and prostate cancer (7 patients [8.6%, in males]). The O/E ratios for EPMs were significantly increased for cancer in general (3.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.39-5.37), renal cell (9.62; 95% CI, 1.98-28.10), prostate (4.91; 95% CI, 1.59-11.45), and breast cancer (3.16; 95% CI, 1.03-7.37).We report an increased risk of EPMs in patients with IPMN, especially for renal cell, prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer."
3,Genetic Risk Score Is Associated With Prevalence of Advanced Neoplasms in a Colorectal Cancer Screening Population.,"The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be used to calculate an individual's risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), called a genetic risk score (GRS). We investigated whether GRS can identify individuals with clinically relevant neoplasms in a screening colonoscopy population.We derived a GRS based on 48 SNPs associated with CRC, identified in a comprehensive literature search. We obtained genetic data from 1043 participants (50-79 years old) in a screening colonoscopy study in Germany, recruited from 2005 through 2013 (294 with advanced neoplasms, 249 with non-advanced adenoma (NAAs), and 500 without neoplasms). Each participant was assigned a GRS by aggregating their risk alleles (0, 1, or 2). Risk of advanced neoplasms and NAA according to GRS was calculated by multiple logistic regression. Risk advancement periods were calculated. We replicated our findings using data from a subset of the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study.An increased GRS was associated with higher prevalence of advanced neoplasms, but not NAAs. Participants in the middle and upper tertiles of GRS had a 2.2-fold and 2.7-fold increase in risk, respectively, of advanced neoplasms compared to those in the lower tertile. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-1.57) for NAA in the middle tertile and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.70-1.55) for NAA in the upper tertile. The ORs were largest for proximal advanced neoplasms for participants in the middle tertile (OR, 3.55; 95% CI 1.85-6.82) and the upper tertile (OR, 3.61; 95% CI 1.84-7.10). The risk advancement period for medium vs low GRS was 13.4 years (95% CI 4.8-22.0) and for high vs low GRS was 17.5 years (95% CI, 7.8-27.3).In a genetic analysis of participants in a CRC screening study in Germany, an increased GRS (based on CRC-associated SNPs) was associated with increased prevalence of advanced neoplasms. These findings might be used in defining risk-adapted screening ages."
3,"Nonepithelial Neoplasms of the Pancreas, Part 2: Malignant Tumors and Tumors of Uncertain Malignant Potential From the Radiologic Pathology Archives.","Almost all neoplasms of the pancreas are derived from pancreatic epithelial components, including the most common pancreatic mass, primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Nonepithelial neoplasms comprise only 1%-2% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Although some may arise directly from intrapancreatic elements, many originate from mesenchymal, hematopoietic, or neural elements in the retroperitoneal peripancreatic space and grow into the pancreas. Once these tumors reach a certain size, it can be challenging to identify their origin. Because these manifest at imaging as intrapancreatic masses, awareness of the existence and characteristic features of these nonepithelial neoplasms is crucial for the practicing radiologist in differentiating these tumors from primary epithelial pancreatic tumors, an important distinction given the vastly different management and prognosis. In part 1 of this article, the authors reviewed benign nonepithelial neoplasms of the pancreas. This article focuses on malignant nonepithelial neoplasms and those of uncertain malignant potential that can be seen in the pancreas. The most common malignant or potentially malignant nonepithelial pancreatic tumors are of mesenchymal origin and include soft-tissue sarcomas, solitary fibrous tumor, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. These tumors commonly manifest as large heterogeneous masses, often containing areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The clinical features associated with these tumors and the imaging characteristics including enhancement patterns and the presence of fat or calcification help distinguish these tumors from PDAC. Hematopoietic tumors, including lymphoma and extramedullary plasmacytoma, can manifest as isolated pancreatic involvement or secondarily involve the pancreas as widespread disease. Hyperenhancing paragangliomas or hypervascular metastatic disease can mimic primary pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or vascular anomalies."
3,IFITM1 Outperforms CD10 in Differentiating Low-grade Endometrial Stromal Sarcomas From Smooth Muscle Neoplasms of the Uterus.,"Distinguishing between uterine neoplasms of smooth muscle and endometrial stromal origin is a frequent diagnostic challenge. We investigated the staining pattern of interferon-induced transmembrane protein-1 (IFITM1), a novel endometrial stromal marker, in endometrial and smooth muscle uterine neoplasms and compared it with CD10 in its ability to differentiate between these two groups. Immunohistochemistry for IFITM1 and CD10 was performed in 20 cases of smooth muscle neoplasms (10 cases leiomyoma, 10 cases leiomyosarcoma), 14 cases of endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) (12 cases of low grade and 2 cases of high grade) and 12 cases of carcinosarcoma. Staining was scored in terms of intensity and distribution (0=absent, 1=weak/<50%, 2=moderate/50%-75%, 3=strong/>75%). A total score was obtained by adding intensity and distribution scores and classified as positive (score 3-6) or negative (score 0-2). IFITM1 was positive in 10 of 12 (83%) low-grade ESSs, 6 of 20 (30%) smooth muscle tumors (leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas) and 11 of 12 carcinosarcomas (91.6%). The 2 cases of high-grade ESS were IFITM1 negative. While both IFITM1 (83%) and CD10 (91%) had high sensitivity in differentiating low-grade ESSs from smooth muscle neoplasms, IFITM1 (70%) had higher specificity compared with CD10 (45%). In this study IFITM1 appears to be a more specific marker of endometrial stromal differentiation compared with CD10 in differentiating low-grade ESSs from smooth muscle neoplasms. Thus, IFITM1 may be a valuable tool as part of an immunohistochemical evaluation panel in this diagnostic scenario."
3,The Profile of Heparanase Expression Distinguishes Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma from Benign Neoplasms.,"The search for a specific marker that could help to distinguish between differentiated thyroid carcinoma and benign lesions remains elusive in clinical practice. Heparanase (HPSE) is an endo-beta-glucoronidase implicated in the process of tumor invasion, and the heparanase-2 (HPSE2) modulates HPSE activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of heparanases in the development and differential diagnosis of follicular pattern thyroid lesions.HPSE and HPSE2 expression by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry evaluation, western blot analysis and HPSE enzymatic activity were evaluated.The expression of heparanases by qRT-PCR showed an increase of HPSE2 in thyroid carcinoma (P = 0.001). HPSE activity was found to be higher in the malignant neoplasms than in the benign tumors (P<0.0001). On Western blot analysis, HPSE2 isoforms were detected only in malignant tumors. The immunohistochemical assay allowed us to establish a distinct pattern for malignant and benign tumors. Carcinomas showed a typical combination of positive labeling for neoplastic cells and negative immunostaining in colloid, when compared to benign tumors (P<0.0001). The proposed diagnostic test presents sensitivity and negative predictive value of around 100%, showing itself to be an accurate test for distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions.This study shows, for the first time, a distinct profile of HPSE expression in thyroid carcinoma suggesting its role in carcinogenesis."
3,"Metachronous triple primary neoplasms with primary prostate cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer: A case report.","Multiple primary neoplasms (MPNs) are rare. Most MPNs are double, and triple primary neoplasms are extremely rarer. Here, we describe a case of a 66-year-old man diagnosed with metachronous triple primary neoplasms with primary prostate cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer.The patient complained of dysuria in January 2015, and he underwent transurethral resection of the prostate. The pathological results showed acinar adenocarcinoma of prostate with a Gleason score of 3+3. In January 2017, he complained of lower abdominal pain, then he took an enteroscopy examination, found a mass in the sigmoid colon, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography examination showed masses in the sigmoid colon and right upper lobe of the lung. Biopsy of the colon showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog exon 2 mutation, and biopsy of the lung showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with epidermal rowth factor receptor exon 21 mutation.Metachronous triple primary neoplasms with primary prostate cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer.The patient underwent surgical resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, postoperative stage was T1bN0M0 (stage IA). After 8 cycles of chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 regimen (oxaliplatin 85?€?mg/m, leucovorin 400?€?mg/m, 5-fluorouracil 400?€?mg/m on day 1, followed by 5-fluorouracil 2400?€?mg/m intravenous infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks), the patient underwent radical resection of colon cancer, and he finished the remaining 4 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 regimen chemotherapy in November 2017.The patient takes examination every three months, and the results show no recurrence.When considering MPNs, thorough surveillance by new screening methods is required to detect a second or even third neoplasm at an early stage."
3,Endoscopic Ultrasound Imaging for Differential Diagnosis of Pancreatic Neoplasms: A 7-Year Study in a Chinese Population.,"BACKGROUND Currently, non-invasive methods for screening pancreatic cancer are lacking. There is little information regarding whether endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) imaging has a discriminatory ability for detecting benign and malignant pancreatic neoplasms. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the demographic, clinicopathologic, and EUS features and follow-up information. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 58 patients with pancreatic neoplasms who underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) over a 7-year period (2009-2016) at our Department of Digestive Diseases were enrolled in our study. RESULTS Of the 58 patients, 38 (65.5%) were diagnosed with malignant pancreatic neoplasms and 20 (34.5%) were benign ones. Of all the EUS findings, size of neoplasm (P=0.037) and regularity of margin (P=0.011) were significantly different between malignant and benign pancreatic neoplasms. However, age, sex, location, echo pattern, and dilation of main pancreatic duct did not show any significant difference (P>0.05). Size combined with regularity to detect malignant pancreatic neoplasms showed the following diagnostic values: sensitivity, 73.68%; specificity, 90%; positive predictive value, 76.60%; negative predictive value 81.82%; and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.887 (95% CI: 0.777-0.955, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Our results showed the high value of EUS for differentiating malignant pancreatic neoplasms from benign ones. Due to this and its non-invasive nature, EUS should be the first-line method for detection of neoplastic pancreatic lesions."
3,"Occurrence of neoplasms in individuals with congenital, severe GH deficiency from the Itabaianinha kindred.","Growth hormone (GH) and the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) have cell proliferative and differentiation properties. Whether these hormones have a role in mutagenesis is unknown. Nevertheless, severe IGF-I deficiency seems to confer protection against the development of neoplasms. Here, we report five cases of adult patients with severe and congenital isolated GH deficiency (IGHD) due to the c.57+1G>A mutation in the GHRH receptor gene, who developed tumors. Four GH-na??ve subjects presented skin tumors: a 42-year-old man with a fibroepithelial polyp, a 53-year-old woman and two men (59 and 56?€?years old) with epidermoid skin cancers. One of these died from it after three surgeries and radiotherapy. The fifth patient was a 25-year-old woman, who had intermittently received GH replacement therapy (GHRT) from age 11 to 18, who developed an ependymoma extending from the fourth ventricle to the end of the thoracic spine. She underwent three surgical procedures, without obvious evidence of tumor recurrence during the six years follow up. These observations suggest that severe IGHD does not protect completely from development of tumors."
3,Pancreatic cysts or pancreatic cystic neoplasms? An analysis of 145 cases.,"Introduction Frequency of detection of pancreatic cystic lesions increased recent years. The majorities are pseudocysts, the remaining cysts are mainly neoplasms. Proven risk of malignancy affects intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN). Material and methods 145 patients operated on at the Department of General and Transplant Surgery in Barlicki Hospital in Lodz, Poland, in 2007-2016 due to pancreatic cystic lesion. The type of surgery, histopathological diagnosis and basic demographic data were analyzed. Results Nonneoplastic cyst (mainly pseudocysts) was found in 66.9% of patients, neoplasms were detected in 33.1%. The mean age was significantly higher in patients with neoplasms than without neoplasm (57.06 years vs. 50.88 years, p = 0.009). Neoplastic cyst occurred more frequently in women (68.75% of women, 31.25% of men, p = 0.001), Nonneoplastic cyst was found significantly more often in men (64.95% of men, 35.05% of women, p = 0.001). Malignant tumor was found in 14.58% of neoplasms cases. Pancreatic resections in neoplastic cysts were performed in 77,08%. In patients with nonneoplastic cysts drainage operations were performed most frequently (80.41%). Conclusions Neoplastic cysts are more common in women. The average age in the group of patients with neoplasms is higher than in the group with nonneoplastic cysts. In women with pancreatic cystic lesion without history for pancreatitis, the probability of neoplasms diagnosis is high. Discussion Pancreatic cystic tumors are treated radically due to the lack of sufficiently sensitive and specific pre-operative examinations. The natural history of mucinous neoplasms (IPMN and MCN) ranges from dysplasia to cancer. There are no guidelines that could be in satisfactory way used in follow up patients with pancreatic cysts."
3,Molecular Diagnostics in the Neoplasms of Small Intestine and Appendix: 2018??Update.,"Neoplasms of the small intestine are rare in comparison with colorectal tumors. The most common tumor types arising in the small intestine are adenocarcinomas, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and lymphoma. Primary appendiceal neoplasms are rare and found in less than 2% of appendectomy specimens with an incidence of approximately 1.2 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States. This article explores molecular diagnostics in the neoplasms of small intestine and appendix."
3,The number of positive nodes accurately predicts recurrence after pancreaticoduodenectomy for nonfunctioning neuroendocrine neoplasms.,"The most appropriate nodal staging for pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) is unclear. Aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the number of positive lymph nodes on prognosis after pancreaticoduodenectomy for PanNENs.A retrospective analysis of pancreaticoduodenectomies for nonfunctioning PanNENs was performed. PanNENs with nodal metastases (N+) were classified into N1 (1 to 3 positive lymph nodes) and N2 (4 or more positive lymph nodes). Univariate and multivariate analyses of disease-free survival were performed.157 patients were included. 99 patients (63%) had N0 PanNENs whereas 58 patients (37%) had nodal involvement (N+). Patients with N0 PanNENs had a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 89% compared with 83% and 75% in patients with N1 and N2 PanNENs, respectively (P??<??0.0001). Independent predictors of disease-free survival were the presence of necrosis, lymph node ratio and nodal status. Factors positively correlated with the number of positive lymph nodes were the Ki67 value, the T stage??and the number of examined lymph nodes. Similar percentage of N0 and N+??PanNENs was demonstrated for a cut-off of 13 examined lymph nodes.The number of positive lymph nodes is accurate in predicting recurrence for PanNENs. Thirteen examined lymph nodes seems to be the minimum number of lymph nodes to be resected/examined in patients who undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy for PanNENs."
3,"Clinicopathological features and prognosis of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms in a Chinese population: a large, retrospective single-centre study.","Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) are the most common type of neuroendocrine tumors, accounting for more than half of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). We performed a retrospective study in our center to investigate the clinicopathological features, risk factors of metastasis, and prognosis of GEP-NENs in a Chinese population.Four hundred forty patients with GEP-NENs treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between January 2011 and March 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for metastasis of the tumors. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and log-rank tests for comparisons among groups.Primary sites were the stomach (24.3%), rectum (24.1%), pancreas (20.5%), esophagus (12.3%), unknown primary origin (UPO-NEN) (8.0%), duodenum (6.1%). Three hundred eighty-nine of the 440 GEP-NENs cases (88.4%) were non-functional tumors, and patients had non-specific symptoms, which could have led to delay in diagnosis and treatment. Neuroendocrine tumor, neuroendocrine carcinoma, and mixed adenoendocrine carcinoma were 56.8%, 33.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the cases. One hundred thirty (29.5%) of the tumors were G1, 120 (27.3%) G2, and 190 (43.2%) G3. The immunohistochemical positive rate of synaptophysin was 97.7% and of chromogranin 48.7%. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the diameter and pathological classification of tumors were the most important predictors for metastasis. The median survival time was 34??months for patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors grade G3 and 11??months for poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma. The median survival time of patients with localized disease, regional disease, and distant disease was 36??months, 15??month, and 6??months, respectively.This study constitutes a comprehensive analysis of the clinicopathological features of GEP-NENs in a Chinese population. GEP-NENs may occur at any part of the digestive system. The diameter and pathological classification of tumor are the most important predictors for metastasis. The prognosis is poor for patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine cancers and distant metastases."
3,Clinicopathological and Prognostic Role of Long Noncoding RNA Linc00152 in Various Human Neoplasms: Evidence from Meta-Analysis.,"Recent researches have demonstrated that long noncoding RNA linc00152 was aberrantly upregulated in multiple tumor types. High expression of linc00152 was associated with poor outcomes in cancer patients. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate its potential value as a prognostic predictor in various human neoplasms. Eligible studies were searched through several electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Eight original studies including 752 cancer patients were ultimately enrolled. Statistical analysis suggested that overexpression of linc00152 was significantly correlated with unfavorable overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.59-2.64) and disease-free/progression-free survival (DFS/PFS) (HR = 3.52, 95% CI: 1.82-6.79) in cancer patients. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between aberrant linc000152 expression and lymph node metastasis (LNM) (OR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.57-3.94) but not in vessel invasion (VI) (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.54-1.93) and distant metastasis (DM) (OR = 0.600, 95% CI: 0.213-1.689). Our meta-analysis demonstrated that high linc00152 expression significantly predicted inferior OS and DFS/PFS in multiple neoplasms, as well as advanced LNM and VI. Linc00152 may serve as a potential indicator in predicting poor outcomes and metastases of diverse cancers."
3,Impact of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) single nucleotide polymorphisms on outcome in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.,"Angiogenesis represents a key event in cancer development, leading to local invasion e metastatization, and might be considered a basic feature in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) with a high expression of angiogenic molecules. We aimed to analyze the prognostic and predictive role of angiogenic factors in GEP-NENs through the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGF-A, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. The genomic DNA of 58 consecutive patients with GEP-NENs treated at our Institution was extracted from peripheral blood. Two SNPs were identified respectively in VEGF-A (rs2010963G>C, rs699947A>C), VEGFR-2 (rs2305948C>T, rs1870377T>A), and VEGFR-3 (rs307821T>C, rs307826C>A) gene. Gene polymorphisms were determined by Real-Time PCR using TaqMan assays. Median age was 57 years (range 24-79 years); 32 patients were male and 77.5% of NENs were localized in the pancreas. The allele frequency of VEGFR-2 rs2305948T and of VEGF-A rs2010963C showed a trend of higher frequency than in general population (12.1% vs. 8.0% and 34.5% vs. 31.2%, respectively). Three out SNPs (VEGF-A rs699947C, VEGF-A rs2010963GC and VEGFR-3 rs307821C) showed a correlation with an increased risk of disease relapse. Moreover median PFS changes according to the presence of 0-1 SNPs (20.7% of cases; 61.9 months), 2 SNPs (25.9%; 49.2 months) and 3 SNPs (53.4%; 27.8 months) (p = 0.034). Results suggest, for the first time, that specific SNPs in VEGF-A and VEGFR-3 correlate with poor prognosis in GEP-NENs. The identification of this new prognostic factor might be helpful in order to optimize the management of these heterogeneous neoplasms."
3,Vasostatin-1: A novel circulating biomarker for ileal and pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.,"Chromogranin A (CgA) is a plasma biomarker widely used in the follow-up of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). However, its accuracy as a tumor biomarker is relatively low because plasma CgA can increase also in patients with other diseases or in subjects treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), a class of widely-used drugs.In the attempt to identify a more reliable biomarker for NENs, we investigated, by ELISA, the circulating levels of full-length CgA (CgA1-439) and of various CgA-derived fragments in 17 patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs, 10 healthy controls, and 21 healthy volunteers before and after treatment with PPIs.Patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs showed increased plasma levels of total-CgA and CgA1-76 fragment (vasostatin-1, VS-1) compared to controls [median (25th-75th-percentiles); total-CgA: 1.85 nM (1.01-4.28) vs 0.75 nM (0.52-0.89), p = 0.004; VS-1: 2.76 nM (1.09-7.10) vs 0.29 nM (0.26-0.32), p<0.001, respectively], but not of CgA1-439 or CgA1-373 fragment. VS-1 positively correlated with total-CgA (r = 0.65, p<0.001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic area under the curve was 0.9935 for VS-1 and 0.8824 for total-CgA (p = 0.067). Treatment of patients with somatostatin analogues decreased both total-CgA and VS-1. In contrast, administration of PPIs increased the plasma levels of total-CgA, but not of VS-1.These findings suggest that plasma VS-1 is a novel biomarker for ileal and pancreatic NENs. Considering that VS-1 is a well-defined fragment not induced by proton-pump inhibitors, this polypeptide might represent a biomarker for NENs diagnosis and follow-up more accurate and easier to standardize than CgA."
3,Myeloproliferative neoplasms with concurrent BCR-ABL1 translocation and JAK2 V617F mutation: a multi-institutional study from the bone marrow pathology group.,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms arise from hematopoietic stem cells with somatically altered tyrosine kinase signaling. Classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms is based on hematologic, histopathologic and molecular characteristics including the presence of the BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 V617F. Although thought to be mutually exclusive, a number of cases with co-occurring BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 V617F have been identified. To characterize the clinicopathologic features of myeloproliferative neoplasms with concomitant BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 V617F, and define the frequency of co-occurrence, we conducted a retrospective multi-institutional study. Cases were identified using a search of electronic databases over a decade at six major institutions. Of 1570 patients who were tested for both BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 V617F, six were positive for both. An additional five patients were identified via clinical records providing a total of 11 cases for detailed evaluation. For each case, clinical variables, hematologic and genetic data, and bone marrow histomorphologic features were analyzed. The sequence of identification of the genetic abnormalities varied: five patients were initially diagnosed with a JAK2 V617F+ myeloproliferative neoplasm, one patient initially had BCR-ABL1+ chronic myeloid leukemia, while both alterations were identified simultaneously in five patients. Classification of the BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms varied, and in some cases, features only became apparent following tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Seven of the 11 patients showed myelofibrosis, in some cases before identification of the second genetic alteration. Our data, reflecting the largest reported study comprehensively detailing clinicopathologic features and response to therapy, show that the co-occurrence of BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 V617F is rare, with an estimated frequency of 0.4%, and most often reflects two distinct ('composite') myeloproliferative neoplasms. Although uncommon, it is important to be aware of this potentially confounding genetic combination, lest these features be misinterpreted to reflect resistance to therapy or disease progression, considerations that could lead to inappropriate management."
3,Clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: a multicenter study in South China.,"Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors. Many issues in terms of epidemiologic features, pathogenesis, and treatment of GEP-NENs are still under discussion. Our study aimed to analyze the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of Chinese patients with GEP-NENs.Complete clinicopathologic data and survival information of 1183 patients with GEP-NENs treated between 2005 and 2015 were collected from five medical centers in Guangdong Province, China. Patient survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test; prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model.The most common tumor location was the rectum (37.4%), followed by the pancreas (28.1%), stomach (20.7%), small intestine (7.2%), appendix (3.4%), and colon (3.3%). After initial definitive diagnosis, 1016 (85.9%) patients underwent surgery. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for the entire cohort were 87.9%, 78.5%, and 72.8%, respectively. The 3-year OS rates of patients with G1, G2, and G3 tumors were 93.1%, 82.7%, and 43.1%, respectively (P??<??0.001). The 3-year OS rates of patients with stage I, II, III, and IV tumors were 96.0%, 87.3%, 64.0%, and 46.8%, respectively (P??<??0.001). Patients with distant metastasis who underwent palliative surgery had a longer survival than those who did not (P??=??0.003). Similar survival benefits of palliative surgery were observed in patients with neuroendocrine tumor (P??=??0.031) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (P??=??0.046). In multivariate analysis, age, grade, N category, M category, and surgery were found to be independent prognostic factors.Patients with GEP-NENs who are women, younger than 50??years old, have smaller tumor size, have lower tumor grade, have lower T/N/M category, and who undergo surgery can have potentially longer survival time. Our data showed that surgery can improve the prognosis of GEP-NEN patients with distant metastasis. However, randomized controlled trials need to be conducted to establish the optimal criteria for selecting patients to undergo surgery."
3,Role of biomarkers in predicting the occurrence of thyroid neoplasms in radiation-exposed children.,"With increasing numbers of childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation, there is a need to evaluate potential biomarkers that could signal an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer. We aimed to examine the relationships between thyrotropin and thyroglobulin levels and the risk of developing thyroid nodules and cancer in a cohort of radiation-exposed children. 764 subjects who were irradiated in the neck area as children were examined and followed for up to 25 years. All subjects underwent a clinical examination, measurements of thyrotropin, thyroglobulin levels and thyroid imaging. At baseline, 216 subjects had thyroid nodules and 548 did not. Of those with nodules, 176 underwent surgery with 55 confirmed thyroid cancers. During the follow-up, 147 subjects developed thyroid nodules including 22 with thyroid cancer. Thyroglobulin levels were higher in subjects with prevalent thyroid nodules (26.1?€?ng/mL vs 9.37?€?ng/mL; <i>P</i>?€?<?€?0.001) and in those who had an initial normal examination but later developed thyroid nodules (11.2?€?ng/mL vs 8.87?€?ng/mL; <i>P</i>?€?=?€?0.017). There was no relationship between baseline thyrotropin levels and the prevalent presence or absence of thyroid nodules, whether a prevalent neoplasm was benign or malignant, subsequent development of thyroid nodules during follow-up or whether an incident nodule was benign or malignant. In conclusion, in radiation-exposed children, higher thyroglobulin levels indicated an increased risk of developing thyroid nodules but did not differentiate between benign and malignant neoplasms. There was no association between the baseline TSH level and the risk of developing thyroid nodules or cancer."
3,Novel EWSR1-SMAD3 Gene Fusions in a Group of Acral Fibroblastic Spindle Cell Neoplasms.,"Benign/low-grade fibroblastic tumors encompass a broad spectrum of tumors with different morphologies and molecular genetic abnormalities. However, despite significant progress in recent genomic characterization, there are still tumors in this histologic spectrum that are difficult to classify, lacking known molecular characteristics. Triggered by a challenging congenital spindle cell neoplasm arising in the heel of a 1-year-old boy, we applied RNA sequencing for genetic discovery and identified a novel EWSR1-SMAD3 gene fusion. On the basis of the index case superficial acral location and fibroblastic appearance with a nonspecific immunophenotype, we searched our files for similar cases and screened them by fluorescence in situ hybridization for these abnormalities. Thus an identical EWSR1-SMAD3 fusion was identified in 2 additional spindle cell tumors with similar clinicopathologic features. Both cases occurred in the feet of adult women (58 and 61?€?y old) and were characterized by distinctive nodular growth with zonation pattern of peripheral hypercellular areas arranged in short fascicles, transitioning to hypocellular central areas of hyalinization and infarction. Focal stippled calcification in the collagenous area was present in 1 case. All 3 tumors had similar immunoprofiles, being negative for SMA, CD34, CD31, and S100, but showing consistent ERG positivity of uncertain significance. Follow-up information was available in 2 patients who developed local recurrences after incomplete initial excisions, at 5 and 14 months, respectively. None developed metastatic disease. In summary, we report a group of locally recurrent superficial acral tumors, characterized by bland spindle cell fascicular growth, occasional zonation pattern, ERG positivity, and recurrent EWSR1-SMAD3 gene fusions."
3,[Primary screening of substances-photosensibilizers of the bacteriochlorin range for photodynamic therapy of malignant neoplasms].,"This paper presents a primary screening of bacteriochlorin-type compounds with aminoamide, propyl and carbohydrate substituents aimed for development a new generation photosensitizers (PS) for photodynamic therapy of malignant tumors. Absorption and fluorescence spectral characteristics of the compounds, their storage stability in solutions under dark conditions and light exposure, photo-induced and dark cytotoxicity against human HEp2 tumor cells have been studied. It has been shown that the dyes with aminoamide substituents have an absorbtion maximum at 754??2 nm in the long wavelength region and they are not stable during storage (the specific fluorescence intensity decreased by 33-56% during 24 hours). The long wavelength region absorption of the propyl and carbohydrate substituted compounds varied in the range 780-831 nm, they were stable in solutions during storage and under light irradiation. Except the dye with a carbohydrate residue in the exocycle E, all PS exhibited the high photo-induced activity and low level of the dark cytotoxicity. The highest photo-induced cytotoxicity was observed for compounds with aminoamide substituents inthe macrocyclic ring (IC 50 values ranged from 17 nM to49 nM after 2 hour incubation with PS followed by exposure to the 10 J/cm 2 dose of red light). Taking into account the totality of the physico-chemical and biological properties, as well as manufacturability of production, O-propyloxime-N-propoxybacteriopurinimide methyl ester was chosen as the most promising candidate compound for further investigations."
3,Prognostic value of C-reactive protein levels in patients with bone neoplasms: A meta-analysis.,"The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of retrospective studies that investigated the association of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with the overall survival (OS) of patients with bone neoplasms.A detailed literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and PubMed databases up to August 28, 2017, for related research publications written in English. We extracted the data from these studies and combined the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the correlation between CRP levels and OS in patients with bone neoplasms.Five studies with a total of 816 participants from several countries were enrolled in this current meta-analysis. In a pooled analysis of all the publications, increased serum CRP levels had an adverse prognostic effect on the overall survival of patients with bone neoplasms. However, the combined data showed no significant relationship between the level of CRP and OS in Asian patients (HR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.86-3.49; P = 0.125). Similar trends were observed in patients with bone neoplasms when stratified by ethnicity, histology, metastasis and study sample size.The results of this meta-analysis suggest that increased CRP expression indicates a poorer prognosis in patients with bone neoplasms. More prospective studies are needed to confirm the prognostic significance of CRP levels in patients with bone neoplasms."
3,Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy as neoadjuvant therapy for resectable or potentially resectable pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.,"Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is a valid therapeutic option for pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. The aim of this study was to describe an initial experience with the use of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy as a neoadjuvant agent for resectable or potentially resectable pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.The postoperative outcomes of 23 patients with resectable or potentially resectable pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms at high risk of recurrence who underwent neoadjuvant peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy group) were compared with 23 patients who underwent upfront surgical operation (upfront surgery group). Patients were matched for tumor size, grade, and stage. Median follow-up was 61 months.The size (median greatest width) of the primary pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms decreased after neoadjuvant peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (59 to 50?€?mm; P=.047). There were no differences in intraoperative and postoperative outcomes and there were no operative deaths, but the risk of developing a pancreatic fistula tended to be less in the peptide receptor radionuclide therapy group when compared to the upfront surgery group (0/23 vs 4/23; P?€?<?€?.02). The incidence of nodal metastases at the time of resection was also less in the peptide receptor radionuclide therapy group (n=?€?9/23 vs 17/23; P<.02). Neither median disease-specific survival (not reached in either group; P=.411) nor progression-free survival (52 vs 37 months; P>.2) differed between groups, but progression-free survival in the 31 patients who had an R0 resection seemed to be greater in the 15 patients in the peptide receptor radionuclide therapy group versus 16 patients the upfront group (median progression-free survival not reached vs 36 months; P<.05).Neoadjuvant peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for resectable or potentially resectable pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms in patients with high-risk features of recurrence seems to be beneficial, but well-designed and much larger prospective trials are needed to confirm the safety and the oncologic value of this approach."
3,Breast cancer and other neoplasms in women with neurofibromatosis type 1: a retrospective review of cases in the Detroit metropolitan area.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common cancer predisposing syndromes with an incidence of 1 in 3,500 worldwide. Certain neoplasms or malignancies are over-represented in individuals with NF1; however, an increased risk of breast cancer has not been widely recognized or accepted. We identified 76 women with NF1 seen in the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) from 1990 to 2009, and linked them to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry covering the metropolitan Detroit area. Fifty-one women (67%) were under age 50 years at the time of data analysis. Six women developed invasive breast cancer before age 50, and three developed invasive breast cancer after age 50. Using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) calculated based on the SEER age-adjusted invasive breast cancer incidence rates, our findings demonstrated a statistically significant increase of breast cancer incidence occurring in NF1 women (SIR?€?=?€?5.2; 95% CI 2.4-9.8), and this relative increase was especially evident among those with breast cancer onset under age 50 (SIR?€?=?€?8.8; 95% CI 3.2-19.2). These data are consistent with other reports suggesting an increase in breast cancer risk among females with NF1, which indicate that breast cancer screening guidelines should be evaluated for this potentially high-risk group."
3,Endoscopic submucosal dissection for early esophageal neoplasms using the stag beetle knife.,"To determine short- and long-term outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) using the stag beetle (SB) knife, a scissor-shaped device.Seventy consecutive patients with 96 early esophageal neoplasms, who underwent ESD using a SB knife at Kure Medical Center and Chugoku Cancer Center, Japan, between April 2010 and August 2016, were retrospectively evaluated. Clinicopathological characteristics of lesions and procedural adverse events were assessed. Therapeutic success was evaluated on the basis of <i>en bloc</i>, histologically complete, and curative or non-curative resection rates. Overall and tumor-specific survival, local or distant recurrence, and 3- and 5-year cumulative overall metachronous cancer rates were also assessed.Eligible patients had dysplasia/intraepithelial neoplasia (22%) or early cancers (squamous cell carcinoma, 78%). The median procedural time was 60 min and on average, the lesions measured 24 mm in diameter, yielding 33-mm tissue defects. The <i>en bloc</i> resection rate was 100%, with 95% and 81% of dissections deemed histologically complete and curative, respectively. All procedures were completed without accidental incisions/perforations or delayed bleeding. During follow-up (mean, 35 ?? 23 mo), no local recurrences or metastases were observed. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 83% and 70%, respectively, with corresponding rates of 85% and 75% for curative resections and 74% and 49% for non-curative resections. The 3- and 5-year cumulative rates of metachronous cancer in the patients with curative resections were 14% and 26%, respectively.ESD procedures using the SB knife are feasible, safe, and effective for treating early esophageal neoplasms, yielding favorable short- and long-term outcomes."
3,Identification of Felis catus papillomavirus 3 in skin neoplasms from four cats.,"Bowenoid in situ carcinomas (BISCs) are papillomavirus (PV)-induced skin neoplasms that are thought to be caused by Felis catus papillomavirus (FcaPV) 2. As BISCs are typically multiple and can become extensive, they can be difficult to treat. Herein we describe 4 cats that developed skin neoplasms that contained FcaPV-3 DNA. One cat developed multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), 1 a BISC with unusual extension into hair follicles, and 2 developed a single typical-appearing BISC. All neoplasms contained prominent PV-induced cell changes and intense p16<sup>CDKN2a</sup> protein immunostaining. Results from these 4 cats provide evidence that FcaPV-3 could cause a proportion of feline skin cancers, albeit less frequently than FcaPV-2. Excision of the typical BISCs and the BCCs appeared curative. Although the cat with the unusual BISC was euthanized because of the large size of the lesion, evidence from these 4 cats suggests that skin neoplasms that contain FcaPV-3 DNA may have a less aggressive clinical behavior than those associated with FcaPV-2. A consistent feature of the neoplasms in all 4 cats was the presence of prominent basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies; these inclusions have not been reported in lesions caused by FcaPV-2, to our knowledge, and their detection may allow differentiation between the different PV types and could therefore be a useful prognostic feature."
3,Changes in the World Health Organization 2016 classification of myeloid neoplasms everyone should know.,"This review highlights the main changes in the revised 2016 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms (published in 2017) that impact diagnosis and ultimately impact management of patients with these diseases.The revision was based on data accumulated since the 2008 WHO classification, much of which relate to new molecular genetic information about these neoplasms. This massive recent influx of data concerning the significance of pathogenic mutations has affected all myeloid neoplasm categories. The new information has been incorporated as part of the diagnostic criteria of many diseases and has led to the creation of new provisional entities defined by genetic features. Germline mutations that predispose to myeloid neoplasms are also emerging as important findings that impact disease classification.The growing body of genetic data have not only altered the classification of myeloid neoplasms, but are also impacting patient management. Genetically-defined disease categories have characteristic prognoses and predicted clinical behavior. Some mutations are associated with responsiveness to certain therapies, including those that target relevant oncogenes. The disease categories in the new classification facilitate the application of risk-adapted therapy based on the most recently available data."
3,Prevalence of Microsatellite Instability in Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms of the Pancreas.,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) caused by mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) is detected in a small proportion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). dMMR and MSI have been associated with responses of metastatic tumors, including PDACs, to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We performed immunohistochemical analyses of a 445 PDAC specimens, collected from consecutive patients at multiple centers, to identify those with dMMR, based on loss of mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and/or PMS2. We detected dMMR in 1.6% of tumor samples; we found dMMR in a larger proportion of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms-related tumors (4/58, 6.9%) than non- intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms PDAC (5/385, 1.3%) (P = .02). PDACs with dMMR contained potentially immunogenic mutations because of MSI in coding repeat sequences. PDACs with dMMR or MSI had a higher density of CD8+ T cells at the invasive front than PDACs without dMMR or MSI (P = .08; Fisher exact test). A higher proportion of PDACs with dMMR or MSI expressed the CD274 molecule (PD-L1, 8/9) than PDACs without dMMR or MSI (4/10) (P = .05). Times of disease-free survival and overall survival did not differ significantly between patients with PDACs with dMMR or MSI vs without dMMR or MSI. Studies are needed to determine whether these features of PDACs with dMMR or MSI might serve as prognostic factors."
3,"Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: genes, therapies and models.","Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) refer to a group of heterogeneous cancers of neuroendocrine cell phenotype that mainly fall into one of two subtypes: gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs; well differentiated) or gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (GEP-NECs; poorly differentiated). Although originally defined as orphan cancers, their steadily increasing incidence highlights the need to better understand their etiology. Accumulating epidemiological and clinical data have shed light on the pathological characteristics of these diseases. However, the relatively low number of patients has hampered conducting large-scale clinical trials and hence the development of novel treatment strategies. To overcome this limitation, tractable disease models that faithfully reflect clinical features of these diseases are needed. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of the genetics and biology of these diseases based on conventional disease models, such as genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and cell lines, and discuss the phenotypic differences between the models and affected humans. We also highlight the emerging disease models derived from human clinical samples, including patient-derived xenograft models and organoids, which may provide biological and therapeutic insights into GEP-NENs."
3,Immunosuppressant-driven de novo malignant neoplasms after solid-organ transplant.,"Solid-organ transplant recipients are at a 3- to 5-fold increased risk of a de novo malignant neoplasm developing compared with the general population. The most frequently developed virus-associated malignant neoplasms are Kaposi sarcoma (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 208.0), nonmelanoma skin cancer (SIR, 28.6), and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, primarily non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 8.1). Immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors play a key role in either causing or preventing this complication. It is hypothesized that some of these regimens can impair cancer surveillance, facilitate the action of oncogenic viruses, and promote direct oncogenic activity. Evolving research has shown promising dual antitumor and immunosuppressive properties of the mTOR inhibitor class. The effective management of posttransplant neoplasms most likely involves the use of these medications among other preventative options. These measures include monitoring certain viral loads as well as immunosuppressant drug levels. Reducing these levels to as low as possible for healthy engraftment and altering regimens when appropriate are management strategies that could lessen this complication of solid-organ transplant. More studies examining the effects of therapeutic drug monitoring are needed to determine specific plasma drug concentrations that will ensure organ engraftment without the development of de novo malignant neoplasms.

3,Anti-Interferon Alpha Antibodies in Patients with High-Risk BCR/ABL-Negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treated with Recombinant Human Interferon-??.,"BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to characterize the incidence and impact of immunogenicity to interferon-a (IFN-??-2a, IFN-??-2b, and Peg-IFN-??-2a) over a period of 12 months in patients with BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 131 patients from an observational prospective cohort were selected. Antidrug antibodies, in serial serum samples obtained monthly after initiation of therapy, were measured by ELISA and WISH/VSV CPE assays. The association between antidrug antibodies and treatment response and adverse effects was evaluated. RESULTS Among patients who completed 12 months of follow-up, binding antibodies (BAbs) were detected in 53% of those receiving IFN-?? (69 of 131) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 19% (25 of 131). NAbs-positivity was correlated with poorer clinical response, and Bab-positivity was associated with more adverse events. Almost all BAbs and NAbs appeared within 8 months after treatment began (???95%). Complete remission (CR) rate was 62% for patients who were BAbs-positive and 69% for patients who were BAbs-negative; however, the CR rate of patients with NAbs(+) (24%) was obviously lower than in patients with NAbs(-) (75%). Patients with BAbs(+) had more immune adverse effects (including fever, myalgia, skin reaction, and stomatitis) than BAbs(-) patients, and NAbs to IFN-?? had no obvious influence on the adverse effects rate. CONCLUSIONS The development of BAbs and NAbs can adversely affect IFN-a treatment in patients with MPN."
3,A FISH assay efficiently screens for BRAF gene rearrangements in pancreatic acinar-type neoplasms.,"Approximately 1-2% of pancreatic neoplasms are acinar cell carcinomas. Recently, BRAF gene rearrangements were identified in over 20% of acinar-type neoplasms, which included both pure acinar cell carcinomas and mixed carcinomas with acinar differentiation, using next-generation sequencing-based platforms, providing a potential therapeutic target for patients with these neoplasms. Thus, it is clinically important to develop a rapid, cost- and material-efficient assay to screen for BRAF gene fusions in pancreatic acinar-type neoplasms. We developed a dual color, break-apart FISH assay to detect BRAF gene rearrangements in these neoplasms and evaluated its performance in comparison to next-generation sequencing-based studies. A blinded BRAF rearrangement FISH investigation was performed on 31 acinar-type neoplasms that had been studied previously by next-generation sequencing-based analysis as well as on 18 additional acinar-type neoplasms that were accrued over the past 2 years. In total, BRAF fusions were identified in 12/49 (24%) acinar-type neoplasms by FISH. BRAF fusion partners were uncovered by using targeted next-generation sequencing studies in 11 FISH-positive cases that had sufficient material for next-generation sequencing studies. SND1 was the most frequent fusion partner involved in BRAF-fusion acinar-type neoplasms (50%), followed by HERPUD1 (18%). No BRAF fusions were identified by next-generation sequencing in any of the FISH-negative cases investigated. FISH analysis showed that BRAF rearrangements were diffusely present across tumor-rich areas in BRAF-fusion acinar-type neoplasms, which is consistent with an oncogenic driver alteration pattern. Thus, we demonstrated that, in comparison to targeted next-generation sequencing-based technologies, the FISH assay is highly sensitive and specific as well as time- and cost-efficient in the detection of BRAF fusions in acinar-type neoplasms. The FISH assay can be easily implemented in diagnostic settings to identify acinar-type neoplasms patients potentially suitable for targeted therapy to inhibit MAPK pathway activity."
3,Secondary malignant neoplasms following radiotherapy for primary cancer in children and young adults.,"A study was conducted to investigate secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN) occurrence following radiotherapy (RT) for cancer in children and young adults, to examine the spatial distribution of SMNs in relation to the irradiated field, and to evaluate a possible role of bystander effects in SMN distribution. Forty-two SMNs were identified among 7257 subjects diagnosed with cancer while living in Yorkshire, UK. Thirty-two of these occurred in patients receiving RT. Distances between SMN locations and RT field edge were estimated along with dose at SMN site. Expected radiation-induced SMN frequency in remote tissues receiving less than 0.1 Gy was predicted using risk estimates based on atomic bombing data. After a median follow-up period of 7.58??years, patients treated with RT were at a nearly five-fold increased risk of developing a subsequent primary neoplasm than the general population in the 0-29??years age range. The most common type of secondary malignancy associated with RT was of the central nervous system (28%), followed by sarcoma (25%) and leukemia (19%). Considering only solid SMNs developing 5??years or more from treatment, the spatial distribution showed a strong pattern of proximity to the irradiated field, with 68% occurring in-field or within 8??cm of the field edge. The SMN frequency in distant tissues receiving doses of less than 0.1 Gy was low but compatible with local absorbed dose. "
3,Subcutaneous Phaeohyphomycosis: A Clinical Mimic of Skin and Soft Tissue Neoplasms-A Descriptive Study from India.,"Phaeohyphomycosis is a fungal infection caused by heterogenous group of fungi known as phaeoid or dematiaceous fungi. It manifests in four clinical forms-cutaneous, subcutaneous, systemic and cerebral phaeohyphomycosis. The subcutaneous form is the most common presentation. Clinically these subcutaneous swellings resemble benign skin and soft tissue neoplasms like lipoma, sebaceous cyst or neurofibroma. Histopathology serves as a very useful tool in diagnosing these cysts by identifying the fungal elements.A retrospective review of all cases diagnosed as phaeohyphomycosis in the department of Pathology at a tertiary care centre in South India over 9??years (January 2009-December 2017) was done. The clinical, histopathological findings of these cases were reviewed and analysed.Sixty-six cases of subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis were reported during the 9??year period. Sixty-two per cent of these patients were diagnosed as skin and soft tissue neoplasms. In 94% cases, the extremities were affected. Multiple cysts were seen in 11% of patients. Fine needle aspiration cytology was done in 29 cases with fungal hyphae identified in all cases on cytology.Subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis mimics benign skin and soft tissue neoplasms clinically. Histopathological examination along with cytology plays a major role in diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis and thus helps in appropriate patient management."
3,Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms of The Pancreas: A Nationwide Registry-Based Study.,"To investigate the paraclinical and pathological features of surgically resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms in Sweden.A review of prospectively collected data on patients undergoing pancreatic resection for a histopathologically verified intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm between 2010 and 2016 was performed using the Swedish National Registry for Pancreatic and Periampullary Cancer.A total of 3038 pancreatic resections were performed during the study period, of which 251 (8.3%) were due to intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. The intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm cases comprised 227 noninvasive and 24 invasive lesions. There was an annual increase in the number of resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, from 13 in 2010 to 56 in 2016, and an increase in the proportion of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm to the total number of pancreatic resections (4.7%-11%). Biliary obstruction was the only independent predictor of invasive disease, with odds ratio 3.106 (p?€?=?€?0.030). There was no difference in survival between low-, intermediate-, and high-grade dysplastic lesions (p?€?=?€?0.417). However, once invasive, the prognosis was severely impacted (p?€?<?€?0.001). Three-year survival was 90% for noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and 39% for invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Survival was better in lymph node negative invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (p?€?=?€?0.021), but still dismal compared to noninvasive lesions (p?€?<?€?0.001).The number of surgically resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms is increasing in Sweden. Biliary obstruction is associated with invasive disease. Low-to-high-grade dysplastic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm has an excellent prognosis, while invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm has a poor survival rate."
3,Unexpected Neoplasms in Lungs Explanted From Lung Transplant Recipients: A Single-Center Experience and Review of Literature.,"Lung transplantation is a common treatment for various indications, but undiagnosed neoplasms are found in 0.5% to 2.4% of explanted lungs. We report the largest single-institution series of patients with unexpected neoplasms in explanted lungs and compare rates of undiagnosed malignancies before and after the 2005 Lung Allocation Score (LAS) update.We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent lung transplantation at the Cleveland Clinic from 1990 to 2014. In cases of neoplasm discovered on explant, tumor type, pathological stage, recurrence, and date of death were recorded.From January 1, 1990 to June 30, 2014, 1303 patients underwent lung transplantation at the Cleveland Clinic. The overall mean smoking history was 35 pack-years, and 25 undiagnosed lung malignancies were found upon explant in 24 transplant recipients (1.84%). In the post-LAS era (ie, 2005 onward), 20/812 lung transplant recipients had 21 incidental neoplasms in their explanted lungs (2.5%). Seventeen of these 25 tumors occurred in patients with interstitial lung disease; 8 occurred in patients with centrilobular emphysema. Eight tumors recurred (6 in patients with interstitial lung disease and 2 in patients with emphysema). The most common histological tumor types were adenocarcinomas (n??= 14) and squamous cell carcinomas (n??= 7).Unexpected neoplasms were found in 1.84% of lung transplant recipients' explanted lungs, with a slightly higher incidence (2.46%) in the post-LAS era. Neoplasms were more common in patients with interstitial lung diseases than in patients with centrilobular emphysema. Explanted lungs should be pathologically examined for evidence of tumor foci because this can impact post-transplantation management."
3,"An Update on the Diagnosis, Grading, and Staging of Appendiceal Mucinous Neoplasms.","Despite advances in our understanding of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms and their relationship to the pseudomyxoma peritonei syndrome, the classification of mucinous tumors of the appendix is still confusing. This review will provide an update on the various classification systems that have been recently proposed for appendiceal mucinous neoplasia, with a particular emphasis on how to handle and report the histologic findings for these tumors using the newly published Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International (PSOGI) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth edition guidelines. A simplified approach to diagnostic reporting of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms based on the 3-tier AJCC grading scheme is detailed and specific criteria for assessing grade in appendiceal mucinous neoplasia will be outlined. In addition, histologic mimics of appendiceal mucinous neoplasia and how to distinguish these mimics from mucinous neoplasia will be discussed. Finally, despite improvements in diagnostic terminology, significant challenges in classifying appendiceal mucinous neoplasia persist and diagnostic strategies will be detailed to assist practicing pathologists in these challenging scenarios."
3,Surgical Management of Patients with Neuroendocrine Neoplasms of the Appendix: Appendectomy or More.,"Appendiceal neuroendocrine neoplasms (ANEN) are mostly indolent tumours treated effectively with simple appendectomy. However, controversy exists regarding the necessity of oncologic right hemicolectomy (RH) in patients with histologic features suggestive of more aggressive disease. We assess the effects of current guidelines in selecting the surgical strategy (appendectomy or RH) for the management of ANEN. Methods/Aims: This is a retrospective review of all ANEN cases treated over a 14-year period at 3 referral centres and their management according to consensus guidelines of the European and the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Societies (ENETS and NANETS, respectively). The operation performed, the tumour stage and grade, the extent of residual disease, and the follow-up outcomes were evaluated.Of 14,850 patients who had appendectomies, 215 (1.45%) had histologically confirmed ANEN. Four patients had synchronous non-ANEN malignancies. One hundred and ninety-three patients had index appendectomy. Seventeen patients (7.9%) had lymph node metastases within the mesoappendix. Forty-nine patients underwent RH after appendectomy. The percentages of 30-day morbidity and mortality after RH were 2 and 0%, respectively. Twelve patients (24.5%) receiving completion RH were found to have lymph node metastases. Two patients had liver metastases, both of them synchronous. The median follow-up was 38.5 months (range 1-143). No patient developed disease recurrence. Five- and 10-year overall survival for all patients with ANEN as the only malignancy was both 99.05%.The current guidelines appear effective in identifying ANEN patients at risk of harbouring nodal disease, but they question the oncological relevance of ANEN lymph node metastases. RH might present an overtreatment for a number of patients with ANEN."
3,Extraparietal or lymphatic late relapse of neoplasms: confirmation by means of EUS-FNA key for the treatment.,"After treatment intended to cure systemic neoplasms, a series of monitoring strategies are followed.To analyse our experience in confirming the cases of lymphatic or extraparietal relapse in areas accessible to endoscopic ultrasonography plus fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in long-term monitoring (>1 year of treatment for the primary neoplasm) and define what implications have been derived with regards histopathological confirmation in relation to treatment.Retrospective analysis was made of all EUS-FNA carried out in our Endoscopy Unit during the period from 1/07/2007 to 28/02/2010 by means of searches in the Endobase (Olympus) database. Medical records of patients and drug therapy were reviewed in order to check the chemotherapy used in each case.From a total of 154 EUS-FNA carried out in our service, we have detected histopathological confirmation of malignancy in primary neoplasm treated with initial curative intention at least 1 year before. Locations were: esophageal extraparietal involvement of a squamous cell carcinoma (one patient), perirectal adenopathy of rectal adenocarcinoma (one patient), multiple lymphatic relapse of melanoma (two patients), perigastric adenopathy relapse of gastric adenocarcinoma (one patient), pancreatic head mass secondary to initial breast ductal carcinoma (one patient). In all cases, this fact has involved a directed treatment: surgery (one patient), radiotherapy (one patient), chemotherapy (four patients).Confirmation by means of EUS-FNA of late relapse in any section of the digestive tract allowed a treatment to be carried out by surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy."
3,Early evaluation of sunitinib for the treatment of advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms via CT imaging: RECIST 1.1 or Choi Criteria?,"The aim of this study was to assess and compare the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and the Choi criteria in evaluating the early response of advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) treated with sunitinib.Eighteen patients with pathologically proven advanced GEP-NENs treated with sunitinib were enrolled in the study. Pre- and post-treatment CT scans (plain, biphasic enhanced CT scan) were performed on all patients. Changes in the target tumor size and density from pre-treatment to 1.4-3.1??months after treatment were measured and recorded for each patient. Tumor responses were identified using RECIST 1.1 and Choi criteria. The time to tumor progression (TTP) for each patient was measured and compared between groups using the Kaplan-Meier method.Among the 18 patients, 4 (22%) exhibited a partial response (PR), 9 (50%) exhibited stable disease (SD), and 5 (28%) experienced progressive disease (PD), using RECIST 1.1. However, based on the Choi criteria, 8 (44%) patients exhibited a PR, 4 (22%) exhibited SD, and 6 (33%) experienced PD. According to RECIST 1.1, the median TTP of PR, SD and PD group were 16.6, 10.8 and 2.3??months, respectively. The TTP of the PR group was significantly longer than that of the PD group (P?€?=?€?0.007) but insignificant when compared to the SD group (P?€?=?€?0.131). According to Choi criteria, the median TTP of PR, SD and PD group were not reached, 10.8 and 2.3??months, respectively. The TTP of the PR group was significantly longer than that of the SD (P?€?=?€?0.026) and PD groups (P?€?<?€?0.001).The Choi criteria appear to be more sensitive and more precise than RECIST 1.1 in assessing the early response of advanced GEP-NENs treated with sunitinib."
3,Occult Appendiceal Neoplasms in Acute and Chronic Appendicitis: A Single-Institution Experience of 1793 Appendectomies.,"The incidence of appendiceal neoplasms may have been underreported in the past. Patients undergoing incidental appendectomies or appendectomies for chronic appendicitis may be at higher risk for an incidental appendiceal neoplasm. To determine the incidence of occult appendiceal neoplasms and identify risk factors associated with this pathology, a retrospective review of a pathology specimen database was conducted from November 2007 to December 2011, in a single tertiary care hospital center. All patients with appendectomies were included for analysis (n = 1793). Pathology specimens were grouped based on the indication for appendectomy, and the incidence of appendiceal neoplasms, and patient variables among the groups were compared using ??2 test and Student's t test. A total of 1793 appendectomy specimens met criteria for evaluation. The total number of appendiceal neoplasms was 31 (1.7%). There were 14 neoplasms in 1337 (1.0%) cases of acute appendicitis with 2 in 41 (4.9%) cases of chronic and 15 in 415 (3.6%) cases, where an incidental appendectomy was performed (P < 0.001). Patients with carcinoid tumors were significantly younger than patients with noncarcinoid tumors (P = 0.0001). Indication for operation was the only significant factor for predicting an appendiceal tumor on final pathology. Patients who undergo interval or incidental appendectomies may be at higher risk of appendiceal neoplasm compared with those performed for other indications. Younger patients may be at a higher risk of occult appendiceal carcinoid neoplasms than other age groups. Pathologic diagnosis in specific high-risk patient groups may be the only way to effectively capture these tumors for optimal treatment."
3,CA 19-9 to peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) ratio is prognostic in patients with epithelial appendiceal mucinous neoplasms and peritoneal dissemination undergoing cytoreduction surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy: A retrospective cohort study.,"Serum tumour levels have been shown to be prognostic in patients with epithelial appendiceal mucinous neoplasms with peritoneal dissemination (pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP)). A singular index which incorporates both tumour activity (as depicted by serum tumour marker levels) and tumour volume (as depicted by peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI)), may give a more precise surrogate of tumour biological behaviour. The prognostic implication of this index has not yet been reported.A retrospective cohort study of all patients with PMP managed from 1996 to 2016 with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC) was performed by analysing the survival effect of the ratio of preoperative serum CEA, CA19.9 and CA125 to PCI.Three hundred and eighty-six patients were included. In patients with low-grade PMP, elevated CA19-9/PCI ratio resulted in poorer median overall survival times (104 months vs NR, 95%CI 83 - NR, log-rank p??<??0.001) and was an independent predictor of reduced overall survival on multivariable analysis (adjusted HR 5.60, 95%CI 1.60-19.68, p??=??0.007). In patients with high-grade PMP, no statistically significant difference in survival was recognised.CA19-9/PCI ratio is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with low-grade PMP undergoing CRS and IPC. By accounting for both tumour activity and tumour volume simultaneously, this novel index behaves as a surrogate of tumour biology and provides a useful adjunct for decisions regarding treatment allocation in this patient group."
3,Italian pool of asbestos workers cohorts: mortality trends of asbestos-related neoplasms after long time since first exposure.,"Asbestos is a known human carcinogen, with evidence for malignant mesothelioma (MM), cancers of lung, ovary, larynx and possibly other organs. MM rates are predicted to increase with a power of time since first exposure (TSFE), but the possible long-term attenuation of the trend is debated. The asbestos ban enforced in Italy in 1992 gives an opportunity to measure long-term cancer risk in formerly exposed workers.Pool of 43 previously studied Italian asbestos cohorts (asbestos cement, rolling stock, shipbuilding), with mortality follow-up updated to 2010. SMRs were computed for the 1970?????""2010 period, for the major causes, with consideration of duration and TSFE, using reference rates by age, sex, region and calendar period.The study included 51 801 subjects (5741 women): 55.9% alive, 42.6% died (cause known for 95%) and 1.5% lost to follow-up. Mortality was significantly increased for all deaths (SMR: men: 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.06; women: 1.17, 95% CI to 1.12 to 1.22), all malignancies combined (SMR: men: 1.17, 95% CI to 1.14 to 1.20; women: 1.33, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.43), pleural and peritoneal malignancies (SMR: men: 13.28 and 4.77, 95% CI 12.24 to 14.37 and 4.00 to 5.64; women: 28.44 and 6.75, 95% CI 23.83 to 33.69 and 4.70 to 9.39), lung (SMR: men: 1.26, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.31; women: 1.43, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.78) and ovarian cancer (SMR=1.38, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.87) and asbestosis (SMR: men: 300.7, 95% CI 270.7 to 333.2; women: 389.6, 95% CI 290.1 to 512.3). Pleural cancer rate increased during the first 40 years of TSFE and reached a plateau after.The study confirmed the increased risk for cancer of the lung, ovary, pleura and peritoneum but not of the larynx and the digestive tract. Pleural cancer mortality reached a plateau at long TSFE, coherently with recent reports."
3,Chromogranin A in the Follow-up of Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Is It Really Game Over? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Little is known about chromogranin A (CgA) during follow-up of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. We hypothesized that serial CgA monitoring might be useful for the assessment of tumor progression, and we performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis.A bibliographical search was performed in PubMed using ""chromogranin A"" and ""neuroendocrine tumors"" and ""follow-up"" and ""biomarker"" to identify all pertinent articles published in the last 10 years.Eight studies were included in current meta-analysis. Chromogranin A as a follow-up marker shows sensitivity between 46% and 100% and specificity between 68% and 90%. The meta-analysis results showed an overall accuracy of 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81-86.6), a cumulative sensitivity of 74.6% (95% CI, 61.9-85.4), and a cumulative specificity of 84.7% (95% CI, 81.3-87.7). These data indicate that circulating CgA has a better overall accuracy in the follow-up setting; it can be used to rule the diagnosis of recurrence/progression in, rather than to rule it out.Chromogranin A is more reliable when used to monitor disease progression and response to treatment and for the early detection of recurrence after treatment rather than in the diagnostic setting. It is more sensible to use this marker in those cases where the initial values were impaired."
3,Mucinous Cystic Neoplasms Lined by Abundant Mucinous Epithelium Frequently Involve KRAS Mutations and Malignant Progression.,"Pancreatic and hepatic mucinous cyst neoplasms (MCNs) have a malignant potential, but indolent MCNs are not uncommon.The pathological and genetic characteristics of resected MCNs (n=15) categorized by the amount of mucin of the lining epithelium were investigated.MCNs were divided into two groups: (i) a rich (r)-MCN group (n=6), in which more than half of the epithelium was lined by abundant mucinous epithelium; and (ii) a poor (p)-MCN group (n=9), which consisted of the remaining cases. Three patients in the r-MCN group showed invasive carcinoma or high-grade dysplasia, whereas all patients in the p-MCN group showed low-grade dysplasia. Mutations of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) were more frequent in the r-MCN group (83%) (p-MCN; 11%, p<0.05).Mucinous MCNs more frequently have KRAS mutations and higher risk of malignant progression."
3,Nomogram based on tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio to predict survival of patients with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms.,"To assess the predictive value of the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in terms of the clinical outcomes of patients with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms after radical surgery.Data were retrospectively collected from 142 patients who were diagnosed with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms and who underwent radical gastrectomy at our department from March 2006 to March 2015. These data were retrospectively analyzed, and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to identify the optimal value of the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were used to identify prognostic factors. A nomogram was then applied to predict clinical outcomes after surgery.The tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly associated with tumor recurrence, especially with liver metastasis and lymph node metastasis (<i>P</i> < 0.05 for both), but not with clinical characteristics (<i>P</i> > 0.05 for all). A multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival and overall survival (<i>P</i> < 0.05 for both). The concordance index of the nomograms, which included the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Ki-67 index, and lymph node ratio, was 0.788 (0.759) for recurrence-free survival (overall survival) and was higher than the concordance index of the traditional TNM staging system [0.672 (0.663)].The tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms. Nomograms that include the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Ki-67 index, and lymph node ratio have a superior ability to predict clinical outcomes of postoperative patients."
3,Clinicopathological analysis of 46 cases with CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD56<sup>+</sup> immature haematolymphoid malignancy: reappraisal of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell and related neoplasms.,"In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features of CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD56<sup>+</sup> immature haematolymphoid malignancy (iHLM), including blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).We analysed the clinicopathological features of 46 patients diagnosed consecutively with CD4<sup>+</sup> /CD56<sup>+</sup> iHLM. These cases were categorised into three groups based on their immunohistochemical expression of three plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) markers [CD123, CD303 and T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (TCL1)]: cutaneous BPDCN (n??=??35), non-cutaneous BPDCN (n??=??6) and non-BPDCN-type CD56<sup>+</sup> neoplasms (n??=??5). Compared to non-cutaneous BPDCN, cutaneous BPDCN was associated with an older median age at onset (72??years versus 45??years, P??<??0.05), and higher positivity for CD4 (P??<??0.05), CD123 (P??<??0.05) and 2-3 pDC markers (89% versus 50%, P??=??0.05). Cutaneous BPDCN was divided into terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)<sup>+</sup> and TdT<sup>-</sup> subgroups, which did not differ in prognosis, although TdT<sup>+</sup> cases showed a lower median onset age (66??years versus 79??years, P??<??0.05) and higher frequency of extracutaneous lesions (P??<??0.05). Compared to the BPDCN groups, non-BPDCN-type CD56<sup>+</sup> neoplasm cases showed higher cytoplasmic CD3 positivity (P??<??0.05) and less frequent BCL-2 expression (P??<??0.05), and lacked cutaneous lesions. However, the survival curves overlapped. Notably, one case involved an unusual composite neoplasm, comprising CD56<sup>+</sup> lymphoblastic lymphoma and mature CD56<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cell lymphoma.Our present data support the recognition of cutaneous BPDCN as a homogenous entity, in contrast to the non-cutaneous form. Additional research is warranted to characterise non-BPDCN-type CD56<sup>+</sup> neoplasms."
3,ALK-immunoreactive neoplasms.,"Since the first discovery of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) by Morris et al in 1994, the number of ALK-positive neoplasms, either in the form of translocation or gain-of-function mutations, have been dramatically expanded from ALCL of T- and NK-cell origin, to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and rare type of sarcomas.This review covers the major aspects of ALK-immunoreactive neoplasms with emphasis on the pathogenesis of ALK-positive neoplasms. The new advances and rapid-evolving practices using ALK inhibitors for therapy are also discussed at the end of this review.ALK(+) articles published in English literature are retrieved and critically reviewed.ALK(+) neoplasia is a rapidly growing field and the list of ALK(+) neoplasms is being expanded continuously. Accurate and correct diagnosis of ALK(+) neoplasms is of paramount importance in guiding the appropriate treatment in the era of personalized medicine using specific ALK inhibitor."
3,Diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (recommended by the Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumours).,"Progress in the diagnostics and therapy of gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN), the published results of new randomised clinical trials, and the new guidelines issued by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) have led the Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumours to update the 2013 guidelines regarding management of these neoplasms. We present the general recommendations for the management of NENs, developed by experts during the Third Round Table Conference - Diagnostics and therapy of gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: Polish recommendations in view of current European recommenda-tions, which took place in December 2016 in ??elech??w near Warsaw. Drawing from the extensive experience of centres dealing with this type of neoplasms, we hope that we have managed to develop the optimal management system, applying the most recent achievements in the field of medicine, for these patients, and that it can be implemented effectively in Poland. These management guidelines have been arranged in the following order: gastric and duodenal NENs (including gastrinoma); pancreatic NENs; NENs of the small intestine and appendix, and colorectal NENs."
3,"Gastroduodenal neuroendocrine neoplasms, including gastrinoma - management guidelines (recommended by the Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumours).","This paper presents the updated Polish Neuroendocrine Tumour Network expert panel recommendations on the management of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) of the stomach and duodenum, including gastrinoma. The recommendations discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical presentation of these tumours as well as their diagnosis, including biochemical, histopathological, and localisation diagnoses. The principles of treatment are discussed, including endoscopic, surgical, pharmacological, and radionuclide treatments. Finally, there are also recommendations on patient monitoring."
3,Beyond gastric adenocarcinoma: Multimodality assessment of common and uncommon gastric neoplasms.,"Despite advances in molecular biology, imaging, and treatment, gastric neoplasms remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; gastric adenocarcinoma is the fifth most common malignancy and third most common cause of death worldwide (Brenner et al., Methods Mol Biol 472:467-477, 2009; Howson et al. Epidemiol Rev 8:1-27, 1986; Roder, Gastric Cancer 5(Suppl 1):5-11, 2002; Ferlay et al., GLOBOCAN 2012 v1.0, Cancer Incidence and Mortality Worldwide: IARC CancerBase No. 11 [Internet]. International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2013). Because of both the frequency at which malignant gastric tumors occur as well as the worldwide impact, gastric neoplasms remain important lesions to identify and characterize on all imaging modalities. Despite the varied histologies and behaviors of these neoplasms, many have similar imaging features. Nonetheless, the treatment, management, and prognosis of gastric neoplasms vary by pathology, so it is essential for the radiologist to make every effort to differentiate between these lesions and raise the less common entities as differential diagnostic considerations when appropriate."
3,Limited Identification of Dual-time-point Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Advanced Colorectal Neoplasms.,"Objective We investigated whether dual-time-point 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) could improve the positive predictive value for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms (cancer, adenoma ???10 mm or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia). Methods We retrospectively searched for consecutive patients with a known primary cancer, who had a colonic <sup>18</sup>FDG uptake incidentally found by PET/CT, followed by colonoscopy between January 2013 and August 2014. The clinical characteristics including the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were compared between advanced colorectal neoplasms and non-advanced lesions. Results Forty-eight patients had 51 foci with an incidental focal colorectal uptake of <sup>18</sup>FDG. Among these 51 foci, 28 foci were judged as being advanced neoplasms, whereas 23 foci identified as non-advanced lesions. Four cases were missed by PET/CT: two laterally spreading tumors (LSTs) with intramucosal cancer and two severe adenomas (<10 mm). The positive predictive value for the detection of advanced neoplasms was 55%. The per-spot performance of PET/CT showed that SUVmax was significantly higher in advanced neoplasms than in non-advanced lesions for the early-phase (10.1??4.9 vs. 6.5??3.2, p=0.029) and the delayed-phase (12.0??6.0 vs. 7.4??4.0, p=0.022). However, more importantly, there was a significant overlap of the SUVmax and no significant difference was found in the retention index (19.2??20.1 vs. 16.6??29.4, p=0.767). Conclusion Dual-time-point PET/CT was found to have limited impact for identifying advanced colorectal neoplasms in spite of its high sensitivity and it might therefore not be able to identify either LSTs or small advanced neoplasms."
3,Grading and staging mucinous neoplasms of the appendix: a case series and review of the literature.,"The grading and staging of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms is challenging and fraught with terminology problems, but has critical prognostic and therapeutic implications. We utilized a small case series to examine the grading and staging systems of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms and outline the evidence for the new systems proposed in the upcoming 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual. We reviewed 33 cases of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms with available clinical follow-up data, 6 of which were widely disseminated in the peritoneum. An additional 4 cases with disseminated peritoneal involvement were also reviewed. A detailed review of the literature was performed with an emphasis on features associated with disease recurrence and correlation of grade with outcome. Recurrence was not seen in 64 low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMNs) confined to the muscularis propria in our series (n=21) or in the literature (n=43). Of cases of LAMN with neoplastic epithelium present beyond the muscularis propria, 64% (57/89) had peritoneal disease at the time of diagnosis or follow-up. A majority of studies of disseminated appendiceal mucinous neoplasms showed significant five-year survival differences using a three-tier grading scheme. Thus, LAMNs confined to the muscularis propria are best considered as in situ tumors, as these are cured with complete excision. A three-tier system has prognostic significance and should be used for grading of disseminated appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. The conclusions of this case series and literature review provide evidence to support the changes proposed in the 8th edition of the AJCC Staging Manual."
3,Review of the current medical literature and assessment of current utilization patterns regarding mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry in cutaneous Muir-Torre syndrome-associated neoplasms.,"Muir-Torre syndrome is a clinical variant of Lynch syndrome defined by the synchronous or metachronous occurrence of at least one sebaceous neoplasm and at least one Lynch syndrome-related internal cancer. Although screening guidelines for patients with colorectal carcinomas have been established, screening guidelines for cutaneous Muir-Torre associated neoplasms are not currently available. As such, we reviewed the current evidence for the use of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 immunohistochemistry when cutaneous Muir-Torre associated neoplasms are encountered. We identified weak to moderate support overall for the global use of these assays, with some evidence suggesting a tailored approach using clinical parameters as an adjunct. We also assessed the current utilization patterns of attendees of the American Society of Dermatopathology Annual Meeting (Chicago, 2016). We found that 91% of respondents utilize mismatch repair immunohistochemistry, with the majority utilizing these tests only when requested by the submitting clinician."
3,Somatic CALR mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms with nonmutated JAK2.,"Somatic mutations in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2) occur in many myeloproliferative neoplasms, but the molecular pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms with nonmutated JAK2 is obscure, and the diagnosis of these neoplasms remains a challenge.We performed exome sequencing of samples obtained from 151 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. The mutation status of the gene encoding calreticulin (CALR) was assessed in an additional 1345 hematologic cancers, 1517 other cancers, and 550 controls. We established phylogenetic trees using hematopoietic colonies. We assessed calreticulin subcellular localization using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry.Exome sequencing identified 1498 mutations in 151 patients, with medians of 6.5, 6.5, and 13.0 mutations per patient in samples of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis, respectively. Somatic CALR mutations were found in 70 to 84% of samples of myeloproliferative neoplasms with nonmutated JAK2, in 8% of myelodysplasia samples, in occasional samples of other myeloid cancers, and in none of the other cancers. A total of 148 CALR mutations were identified with 19 distinct variants. Mutations were located in exon 9 and generated a +1 base-pair frameshift, which would result in a mutant protein with a novel C-terminal. Mutant calreticulin was observed in the endoplasmic reticulum without increased cell-surface or Golgi accumulation. Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms carrying CALR mutations presented with higher platelet counts and lower hemoglobin levels than patients with mutated JAK2. Mutation of CALR was detected in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Clonal analyses showed CALR mutations in the earliest phylogenetic node, a finding consistent with its role as an initiating mutation in some patients.Somatic mutations in the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone CALR were found in a majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms with nonmutated JAK2.

3,LncNEN885 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition by partially regulation of Wnt/??-catenin signalling in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.,"It has been shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the carcinogenesis of multiple cancers. However, the roles of lncRNAs in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) remain elusive. In the present study, we found that lncNEN885 was markedly decreased in human gastric NEN samples compared to adjacent normal tissues by transcriptome sequencing. Functionally, silencing or overexpression of lncNEN885 could not obviously affect cell proliferation or apoptosis in BON-1 or LCC-18 cells but could affect cell migration and invasion as well as wound-healing rates. Furthermore, dysregulation of lncNEN885 affected these biological functions by activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition through increased expression of Snail, vimentin, and N-cadherin as well as decreased E-cadherin levels in BON-1 and LCC-18 cells. Silencing of lncNEN885 could dramatically increase the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3?? and decrease the expression of adenomatous polyposis coli and Axin, with the subsequent accumulation of ??-catenin. Taken together, dysregulation of lncNEN885 can regulate cell migration and invasion by activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition process partially through canonical Wnt/??-catenin signaling in GEP-NEN cells, which may be a novel biomarker for the metastasis of GEP-NENs."
3,[Current status of hereditary gastrointestinal neoplasms].,"Gastric cancer and colorectal cancer are two common malignant tumors in digestive tract. 1% to 3% of gastric cancer and 5% to 15% of colorectal cancer are definitely hereditary cancer caused by germline gene mutation. Hereditary gastric cancer includes hereditary diffuse gastric cancer(HDGC) and hereditary intestinal gastric cancer (HIGC). CDH1 gene mutation is the main reason to cause HDGC, so the first degree and the second degree family members of HDGC patients are recommended to receive CDH1 mutation detection, endoscopic examination every year and undergo preventive total gastrectomy. Hereditary colorectal cancer includes hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Germline MMR gene mutation detection is the golden standard of the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. Family members of Lynch syndrome patients are recommended to receive endoscopic examination every year and undergo standard cancer radical operation or total colorectal resection based on individual conditions. FAP is caused by APC gene mutation, so FAP patients are recommended to receive endoscopic examination once or twice every year through their lifetime, while a lot of adenoma occur, resection should be considered. The promotion key of hereditary gastrointestinal neoplasms research is to follow the standard diagnosis and treatment guideline for hereditary gastrointestinal neoplasms and build the clinical and gene information bank of hereditary gastrointestinal neoplasms. The second generation sequencing technique provides favorable research stools in elucidating pathogenesis mechanism of hereditary gastrointestinal neoplasms."
3,Calcified pancreatic and peripancreatic neoplasms: spectrum of pathologies.,"A variety of pancreatic and peripancreatic neoplasms may contain calcifications. We present a review of common to uncommon pancreatic neoplasms that may contain calcifications to include ductal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, serous cystadenomas, solid pseudopapillary tumors, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, and lymphoepithelial cysts. In addition, duodenal mucinous adenocarcinoma can present as a peripancreatic mass that may contain calcification. Knowledge of the spectrum of calcification patterns can help the interpreting radiologist provide a meaningful differential."
3,Clinical significance of mesenteric panniculitis-like abnormalities on abdominal computerized tomography in patients with malignant neoplasms.,"To clarify the association of malignancy with mesenteric panniculitis-like changes on computed tomography (CT).All abdominal CT scans performed at NorthShore University HealthSystem showing mesenteric panniculitis from January 2005 to August 2010 were identified in the Radnet (RadNet Corporation, Los Angeles, CA) database. Patients with a new or known diagnosis of a malignancy were included for this analysis. Longitudinal clinical histories were obtained from electronic medical records.In total, 147794 abdominal CT scans were performed during the study period. Three hundred and fifty-nine patients had mesenteric panniculitis (MP)-like abnormalities on their abdominal CT. Of these patients, 81 patients (22.6%) had a known history of cancer at the time of their CT scan. Nineteen (5.3%) had a new diagnosis of cancer in concurrence with their CT, but the majority of these (14/19, 74%) were undergoing CT as part of a malignancy evaluation. Lymphomas were the most common cancers associated with MP-like findings on CT (36 cases, 36%), with follicular lymphoma being the most frequent subtype (17/36). A variety of solid tumors, most commonly prostate (7) and renal cell cancers (6) also were seen. CT follow up was obtained in 56 patients. Findings in the mesentery were unchanged in 45 (80%), worsened in 6 (11%), and improved in 5 patients (9%). Positron emission tomography (PET) scans performed in 44 patients only showed a positive uptake in the mesenteric mass in 2 patients (5%).A new diagnosis of cancer is uncommon in patients with CT findings suggestive of MP. MP-like mesenteric abnormalities on CT generally remain stable in patients with associated malignancies. PET scanning is not recommended in the evaluation of patients with mesenteric panniculitis-like findings on CT."
3,Molecular Genetics of Pancreatic Neoplasms.,"Pancreatic neoplasms have a wide range of??histologic types with distinct clinical outcomes. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have greatly deepened our understanding of pancreatic neoplasms. Now, the exomes of major histologic types of pancreatic neoplasms have been sequenced, and their genetic landscapes have been revealed. This article reviews the molecular changes underlying pancreatic neoplasms, with a special focus on the genetic changes that characterize the histologic types of pancreatic neoplasms. Emphasis is also made on the molecular features of key genes that have the potential for therapeutic targets."
3,Endobronchial Metastasis from Extrapulmonary Neoplasms: Analysis of Clinicopathologic Features and Cytological Evaluation by Bronchial Brushing.,"Bronchial brushings (BB) commonly aid in the diagnosis of primary lung cancer. However, the utility of this method in diagnosing endobronchial metastases (EBM) from extrapulmonic malignancies has not been thoroughly evaluated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of BB in diagnosing EBM.An institutional database was queried for all patients with cytologically or histologically confirmed extrapulmonary EBM identified by endobronchial biopsy between 1978 and 2013. Data were collected on patient demographics, histologic and cytologic diagnoses, time from primary malignancy to identification of EBM, and location of EBM. The sensitivity of BB for the diagnosis of EBM and the clinicopathologic features of extrapulmonary EBM were assessed.Fifty-six patients (33 females, 23 males; mean age 53??years) were identified with EBM. Diagnoses included lymphoma (21), breast adenocarcinoma (11), colonic adenocarcinoma (7), melanoma (6), renal cell carcinoma (RCC, 5), embryonal carcinoma (2), and 1 case each of tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma, thymic carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, and sarcoma, not otherwise specified. The sensitivity of BB for identifying EBM was 85% overall and 94% for non-hematologic malignancies. The mean interval between primary diagnosis and EBM was 59??months (range 0-264??months). Excluding ten patients who had EBM at their initial presentation, lymphoma had the shortest (10??months) and RCC had the longest (264??months) mean interval between primary diagnosis and EBM. The mean time between EBM identification and death was 22.4??months (n??=??24).Bronchial brushing is a sensitive technique for diagnosing non-hematologic extrapulmonic endobronchial metastases."
3,Surgical treatment of malignant and benign colorectal neoplasms based on authors' clinical data.,"Colorectal cancer remains a huge diagnostic and therapeutic issue in Poland and worldwide. World epidemiological data indicates a constant increase in morbidity in recent decades.The aim of this research was to present surgical procedures in malignant and benign colorectal neoplasms based on authors' clinical data.Between 2001 and 2010, in the 1st Department of General and Endocrinological Surgery in Bialystok, 754 patients with malignant colorectal cancer were hospitalized. Precancerous conditions which included polyps and non-specific bowel inflammations were observed in 491 and 52 patients, respectively.The most frequent location of a malignant colorectal tumor was the rectum - 271 (35%) cases and sigmoid colon - 235 (31%) cases. In 8 cases (1%), a multifocal location of colorectal neoplasm was observed. Similar locations were observed in the case of polyps. They were observed the most frequently in the sigmoid colon - 144 (29.3%) cases and rectum - 122 (24.8%) cases. In the cases of colorectal cancer located in the rectum (271), the most frequently applied procedure was abdomino-perineal amputation - 102 (37.6%) patients (T1-3 N1-2 M0). In sigmoid colon cancer (235 cases), sigmoid colon resection was performed most frequently - in 175 patients (74.5%) (T1-3 N0-2 M0-1). Right hemicolectomy was performed in 120 (T1-4 N0-2 M0-1) patients and left hemicolectomy in 52 (T1-4 N02 M0-1) patients. In 482 cases, endoscopic resection of polyps was performed and in 9 patients resection through laparotomy. The majority of operations were performed according to plan, however, many of them were performed in emergency.Colorectal cancers, irrespectively to their location, develop secretly without any symptoms in the early stages which is the reason why patients contact a doctor in the late stadium of the disease. It is also the cause for a majority of the procedures performed in emergency. The best prognosis and long-term results are obtained with treatment combined with radio- and chemotherapy."
3,Rare Cancers and Social Media: Analysis of Twitter Metrics in the First 2??Years of a Rare-Disease Community for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms on Social Media-#MPNSM.,"The use of social media has now become a standard means of communication for many individuals worldwide. The use of one specific form of social media, Twitter, has increased among healthcare providers, both as a means of information gathering and as a conduit for original content creation. Recently, major efforts by users have been put forward to help streamline the unprecedented amount of information that can be found on Twitter. These efforts have led to the creation of diseasespecific hashtag (#) medical communities and have greatly enhanced the ability to understand and better categorize the available data on Twitter. Specifically, for those involved in rare cancer fields, adhering to organically designed and consistently used hashtags has led to the rapid, reliable dissemination of information and the ability to efficiently discuss and debate topics of interest in the field. For the field of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), the creation of #MPNSM (myeloproliferative neoplasms on social media) in 2015 has facilitated interactions among healthcare stakeholders from all over the world in the MPN field.In order to better understand the trends and topics of interest to Twitter users of this novel medical community, we conducted the present analysis which focuses on Twitter analytics from the first two years of #MPNSM. In this analysis, we observed a sustained increase in the number of Twitter users, number of tweets, number of impressions, and number of retweets over time, demonstrating the feasibility of creating and maintaining a disease-specific hashtag for a rare cancer over time."
3,Ruxolitinib-induced defects in DNA repair cause sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in myeloproliferative neoplasms.,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) often carry JAK2(V617F), MPL(W515L), or CALR(del52) mutations. Current treatment options for MPNs include cytoreduction by hydroxyurea and JAK1/2 inhibition by ruxolitinib, both of which are not curative. We show here that cell lines expressing JAK2(V617F), MPL(W515L), or CALR(del52) accumulated reactive oxygen species-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and were modestly sensitive to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors olaparib and BMN673. At the same time, primary MPN cell samples from individual patients displayed a high degree of variability in sensitivity to these drugs. Ruxolitinib inhibited 2 major DSB repair mechanisms, BRCA-mediated homologous recombination and DNA-dependent protein kinase-mediated nonhomologous end-joining, and, when combined with olaparib, caused abundant accumulation of toxic DSBs resulting in enhanced elimination of MPN primary cells, including the disease-initiating cells from the majority of patients. Moreover, the combination of BMN673, ruxolitinib, and hydroxyurea was highly effective in vivo against JAK2(V617F)<sup>+</sup> murine MPN-like disease and also against JAK2(V617F)<sup>+</sup>, CALR(del52)<sup>+</sup>, and MPL(W515L)<sup>+</sup> primary MPN xenografts. In conclusion, we postulate that ruxolitinib-induced deficiencies in DSB repair pathways sensitized MPN cells to synthetic lethality triggered by PARP inhibitors."
3,Microsatellite Status of Primary Colorectal Cancer Predicts the Incidence of Postoperative Colorectal Neoplasms.,"Few studies have evaluated the risk of postoperative colorectal neoplasms stratified by the nature of primary colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we revealed it on the basis of the microsatellite (MS) status of primary CRC.We retrospectively reviewed 338 patients with CRC and calculated the risk of neoplasms during postoperative surveillance colonoscopy in association with the MS status of primary CRC. A propensity score method was applied.We identified a higher incidence of metachronous rectal neoplasms after the resection of MS stable CRC than MS instable CRC (adjusted HR 5.74, p=0.04). We also observed a higher incidence of colorectal tubular adenoma in patients with MSS CRC (adjusted hazard ratio 7.09, p<0.01) and a higher incidence of postoperative tubulovillous/villous adenoma in patients with MS instable CRC (adjusted HR=8.50, p=0.03).The MS status of primary colorectal cancer influenced the risk of postoperative colorectal neoplasms."
3,Fukuoka criteria accurately predict risk for adverse outcomes during follow-up of pancreatic cysts presumed to be intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.,"Fukuoka consensus guidelines classify pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) presumed to be intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into Fukuoka positive (FP) (subgroups of high-risk (HR) and worrisome features (WFs)) and Fukuoka negative (FN) (non-HR feature/WF cysts). We retrospectively estimated 5-year risk of pancreatic cancer (PC) in FN, WF and HR cysts of patients with PCL-IPMN.From Mayo Clinic databases, we randomly selected 2000 patients reported to have a PCL; we excluded inflammatory or suspected non-IPMN cysts and those without imaging follow-up. We re-reviewed cross-sectional imaging and abstracted clinical and follow-up data on PCL-IPMNs. The study contained 802 patients with FN cysts and 358 with FP cysts.Patients with PCL-IPMN had median (IQR) follow-up of 4.2 (1.8-7.1) years. Among FN cysts, 5-year PC risk was low (2-3%) regardless of cyst size (p=0.67). After excluding events in the first 6?€?months, 5-year PC risk remained low (0-2%) regardless of cyst size (p=0.61). Among FP cysts, HR cysts (n=66) had greater 5-year PC risk than WF cysts (n=292) (49.7% vs 4.1%; p<0.001). In HR cysts, 3-year PC risk was greatest for obstructive jaundice versus enhancing solid component or main pancreatic duct >10?€?mm (79.8% vs 37.3% vs 39.4%, respectively; p=0.01).Fukuoka guidelines accurately stratify PCL-IPMNs for PC risk, with FN cysts having lowest and HR cysts having greatest risk. After 6-month follow-up, WF and FN cysts had a low 5-year PC risk. Surveillance strategies should be tailored appropriately."
3,[Pancreatic acinar neoplasms : Comparative molecular characterization].,"Pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas are biologically aggressive neoplasms for which treatment options are very limited. The molecular mechanisms of tumor initiation and progression are largely not understood and precursor lesions have not yet been identified. In this study, pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas were cytogenetically characterized as well as by molecular and immunohistochemical analyses. Corresponding investigations were carried out on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms augmented by functional analyses. We show that pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas display a microsatellite stable, chromosomal unstable genotype, characterized by recurrent chromosomal imbalances that clearly discriminate them from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine neoplasms. Based on findings obtained from comparative genomic hybridization, candidate genes could be identified, such as deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and c-MYC. Furthermore, several therapeutic targets were identified in acinar cell carcinomas and other pancreatic neoplasms, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Moreover, L1CAM was shown to play a significant role in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Functional analyses in cell lines derived from pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms revealed promising anti-tumorigenic effects using EGFR and HSP90 inhibitors affecting the cell cycle and in the case of HSP90, regulating several other oncogenes. Finally, based on mutational analyses of mitochondrial DNA, molecular evidence is provided that acinar cell cystadenomas (or better cystic acinar transformation) represent non-clonal lesions, suggesting an inflammatory reactive non-neoplastic nature."
3,Quality of Local Excision for Rectal Neoplasms Using Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery Versus Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery: A Multi-institutional Matched Analysis.,"There are no data comparing the quality of local excision of rectal neoplasms using transanal endoscopic microsurgery and transanal minimally invasive surgery.The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of tumor fragmentation and positive margins for patients undergoing local excision of benign and malignant rectal neoplasms using transanal endoscopic microsurgery versus transanal minimally invasive surgery.This was a multi-institutional cohort study using coarsened exact matching.The study was conducted at high-volume tertiary institutions with specialist colorectal surgeons.Patients undergoing full-thickness local excision for benign and malignant rectal neoplasms were included.Transanal endoscopic microsurgery and transanal minimally invasive surgery were the included interventions.The incidence of poor quality excision (composite measure including tumor fragmentation and/or positive resection margin) was measured.The matched cohort consisted of 428 patients (247 with transanal endoscopic microsurgery and 181 with transanal minimally invasive surgery). Transanal minimally invasive surgery was associated with shorter operative time and length of stay. Poor quality excision was similar (8% vs 11%; p = 0.233). There were also no differences in peritoneal violation (3% vs 3%; p = 0.965) and postoperative complications (11% vs 9%; p = 0.477). Cumulative 5-year disease-free survival for patients undergoing transanal endoscopic microsurgery was 80% compared with 78% for patients undergoing transanal minimally invasive surgery (log rank p = 0.824). The incidence of local recurrence for patients with malignancy who did not undergo immediate salvage surgery was 7% (8/117) for transanal endoscopic microsurgery and 7% (7/94) for transanal minimally invasive surgery (p = 0.864).All of the procedures were also performed at high-volume referral centers by specialist colorectal surgeons with slightly differing perioperative practices and different time periods.High-quality local excision for benign and rectal neoplasms can be equally achieved using transanal endoscopic microsurgery or transanal minimally invasive surgery. The choice of operating platform for local excisions of rectal neoplasms should be based on surgeon preference, availability, and cost. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A382."
3,Adherence to ARRIVE Guidelines in Chinese Journal Reports on Neoplasms in Animals.,"The Animals in Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines were published in 2010 with the aim of improving the quality of studies involving animals. However, how well Chinese studies involving animal neoplasms adhere to these guidelines has not been assessed.To evaluate the reporting quality of such experiments published between 2010 and 2012 in Chinese journals with support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China.We searched the Chinese Science Citation and Chinese Journal Full-Text Databases for articles published between 2010 and 2012 involving neoplasms in animals. The data were extracted into pre-prepared forms. Reporting quality was assessed using the ARRIVE checklist-39 items plus information on blinding.Three hundred and ninety-six animal studies were included in the analysis: 127 studies published in 2010, 140 studies published in 2011, and 129 studies published in 2012. The range of ARRIVE score is from 12 to 27 with a maximum possible score of 40. Studies published in 2012 (P = 0.012), 2011 (P = 0.015), 2010, July~Dec (P<0.017) had a significantly larger ARRIVE checklist score than those published in Jan.~June, 2010, respectively.Experiments involving neoplasms in animals published in Chinese journals generally have not comprehensively reported the information recommended by the ARRIVE guidelines. We strongly recommend that researchers conducting such studies report this information."
3,Myeloid Neoplasms.,The classification of myeloid neoplasms has undergone major changes and currently relies heavily on genetic abnormalities. Cutaneous manifestations of myeloid neoplasms may be the presenting sign of underlying bone marrow disease. Dermal infiltration by neoplastic cells may occur in otherwise normal skin or in sites of cutaneous inflammation. Leukemia cutis occasionally precedes evidence of blood and/or bone marrow involvement (aleukemic leukemia cutis).
3,Predictors of Nutritional Risk According to NRS-2002 and Calf Circumference in Hospitalized Older Adults with Neoplasms.,"To investigate nutritional markers that better predict nutritional risk according to the Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS-2002), to verify agreement between indicators, and to identify the calf circumference cut-off point for diagnosing nutritional risk.Cross-sectional study with older patients hospitalized for neoplasms. The nutritional risk was assessed by NRS-2002 and the nutritional status by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA long form), calf circumference (CC), and body mass index (BMI). Statistical analyses included the chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests, Kappa coefficient, univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses to analyze the risk factors, and the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve to determine the cut-off point.The NRS-2002 and MNA had good agreement (k = 0.5281), but the NRS-2002 did not agree with the other nutritional indicators. According to regression analysis, the predictors of nutritional risk were the MNA (p = 0.0010, OR = 28.270); BMI (p = 0.0419, OR = 4.681), and age (p = 0.0021, OR = 1.309). The best CC cut-off point for predicting nutritional risk according to the NRS-2002 was ???32.25??cm.Both the NRS-2002 and MNA are useful for the nutritional diagnosis of older adults hospitalized for neoplasms. When the MNA, BMI, and age are used together, they can better predict nutritional risk according to the NRS-2002."
3,The diagnostic utility of combination of HMGA2 and IMP3 qRT-PCR testing in thyroid neoplasms.,"The diagnosis of malignant thyroid tumors in some cytologic and histologic specimens remains challenging. High-mobility group A2 (HMGA2) expression and insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein-3 (IMP3) expression were evaluated by relative quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the combination of HMGA2 and IMP3 qRT-PCR was diagnostically useful in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid neoplasms. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens from 120 patients including 56 benign lesions and 64 carcinomas were used. The available 80 corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) thyroid tissues from 66 patients were also included in this study. HMGA2 and IMP3 expression levels were detected by qRT-PCR and reported as relative fold change after normalizing with a calibrator. The diagnostic utilities of HMGA2 and IMP3 qRT-PCR tests were evaluated individually and in combination. In FNA specimens, HMGA2 and IMP3 expression was consistently higher in thyroid malignancies compared with benign lesions in all subgroups except in H??rthle cell tumors. After exclusion of H??rthle cell tumors, the sensitivity was 90.2% for HMGA2, 88.2% for IMP3, and 98% for HMGA2+IMP3; the specificity was 97.1% for HMGA2, 79.4% for IMP3, and 79.4% for HMGA+IMP3. qRT-PCR data showed similar results in FFPE tissues: the sensitivity was 84.2% for HMGA2, 85.7% for IMP3, and 94.7% for HMGA2+IMP3; the specificity was 96.9% for HMGA2, 91.2% for IMP3, and 90.6% for HMGA2+IMP3. qRT-PCR data were concordant between FNA and FFPE samples for HMGA2 (97.4%) and IMP3 (96.9%). The results indicate that HMGA2 qRT-PCR with high specificity may be a useful ancillary technique to assist in the classification of difficult thyroid specimens, excluding H??rthle cell tumors. The HMGA2 and IMP3 qRT-PCR combination model with increased sensitivity and negative predictive value (96.4%) may be useful in screening thyroid cytology specimens. "
3,Neuroendocrine neoplasms of liver - A 5-year retrospective clinico-pathological study applying World Health Organization 2010 classification.,"To study the clinicopathological characteristics of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) on liver samples and apply World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 grading of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NEN.Clinicopathological features of 79 cases of NEN of the liver diagnosed between January 2011 to December 2015 were analyzed. WHO 2010 classification of GEP NEN was applied and the tumors were graded as G1, G2 or G3. Two more categories, D1/2 (discordant 1/2) and D2/3 (discordant 2/3) were also applied. The D1/2 grade tumors had a mitotic count of G1 and Ki-67 index of G2. The D2/3 tumors had a mitotic count of G2 and Ki-67 index of G3. The follow up details which were available till the end of the study period (December 2015) were collected.Of the 79 tumors, 16 each were G1 and G2, and 18 were G3 tumors. Of the remaining 29 tumors, 13 were assigned to D1/2 and 16 were D2/3 grade. Male preponderance was noted in all tumors except for G2 neoplasms, which showed a slight female predilection. The median age at presentation was 47 years (range 10-82 years). The most common presentation was abdominal pain (81%). Pancreas (49%) was the most common site of primary followed by gastrointestinal tract (24.4%) and lungs (18%). Radiologically, 87% of the patients had multiple liver lesions. Histopathologically, necrosis was seen in only D2/3 and G3 tumors. Microvascular invasion was seen in all grades. Metastasis occurred in all grades of primary NEN and the grades of the metastatic tumors and their corresponding primary tumors were similar in 67% of the cases. Of the 79 patients, 36 had at least one follow up visit with a median duration of follow up of 8.5 mo (range: 1-50 mo). This study did not show any impact of the grade of tumor on the short term clinical outcome of these patients.Liver biopsy is an important tool for clinicopathological characterization and grading of NEN, especially when the primary is not identified. Eighty-seven percent of the patients had multifocal liver lesions irrespective of the WHO grade, indicating a higher stage of disease at presentation. Follow up duration was inadequate to derive any meaningful conclusion on long term outcome in our study patients."
3,Margins for Benign Salivary Gland Neoplasms of the Head and Neck.,"The proper ablation of any neoplasm of the head and neck requires the inclusion of linear and anatomic barrier margins surrounding the neoplasm. Extirpative surgery of the major and minor salivary glands is certainly no exception to this surgical principle. To this end, the selection and execution of the most appropriate ablative surgical procedure for a major or minor benign salivary gland neoplasm is an essential exercise in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Of equal importance is the intraoperative identification and preservation of the pseudocapsule surrounding the benign neoplasm. This article reviews these important elements specifically related to ablative surgery of benign neoplasms of the parotid, submandibular and minor salivary glands with strict attention to observed nomenclature."
3,Recent Advances in the Classification of Low-grade Papillary-like Thyroid Neoplasms and Aggressive Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas: Evolution of Diagnostic Criteria.,"Papillary thyroid carcinomas account for ???80% of well-differentiated thyroid tumors. During the past decade, several new variants of papillary-like thyroid neoplasms and papillary thyroid carcinomas have been recognized. Some of these neoplasms that were previously classified as malignant have been reclassified as low-grade neoplasms, as the diagnostic criteria have evolved. Similarly, some of the papillary thyroid carcinomas that were previously classified as conventional or classic papillary thyroid carcinomas have now been recognized as more aggressive variants of papillary thyroid carcinomas. Recognizing these differences becomes more important for the proper medical, surgical, and radiotherapeutic management of patients with these neoplasms."
3,Lymphoma in Taiwan: Review of 1347 neoplasms from a single institution according to the 2016 Revision of the World Health Organization Classification.,"Lymphoid neoplasms are heterogeneous and types of lymphoma vary in different geographic regions. In this study, we aimed at classifying the lymphoid neoplasms at our institution in Taiwan and to compare the relative frequency of various types of lymphoma in different countries.We retrospectively searched the files of patients diagnosed with lymphoma at our institution from 2000 to 2015 based on the 2016 Revision of the World Health Organization classification.We identified 1339 patients with lymphoid neoplasms; among them, eight had two distinct types of lymphoid neoplasms. Of the 1347 neoplasms, 6.09% were Hodgkin lymphomas (HLs) and 93.31%, non-HL (NHLs). Among the 1257 NHLs, 82.66% were of B-cell lineage and 17.34% of T-cell lineage. The most common B-cell lymphoma types were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Among T-cell neoplasms, 37% cases were of nodal origin and 63% cases arose in extranodal sites. The most common nodal and extranodal T-cell neoplasms were angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, respectively.We analyzed the largest series of lymphomas to date from Taiwan and concluded that HL was rare and T-cell neoplasms comprised around 17% of all NHLs in Taiwan. The relative frequency of the major lymphoma types is similar in East Asian countries, with only a minor difference, but the overall pattern in the East is quite different from that in the West, with the latter showing a higher frequency of HL and a lower rate of T-cell neoplasms."
3,"Evaluating the utility of existing patient-reported outcome scales in novel patient populations with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and myeloproliferative neoplasms using medicare current beneficiary survey data.","While there are validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments for use in specific cancer populations, no validated general instruments exist for use in conditions common to multiple cancers, such as muscle wasting and consequent physical disability. The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a survey in a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries, includes items from three well known scales with general applicability to cancer patients: Katz activities of daily living (ADL), Rosow-Breslau instrumental ADL (IADL), and a subset of physical performance items from the Nagi scale.This study evaluated properties of the Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and a subset of the Nagi scale in patients with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) using data from MCBS linked with Medicare claims in order to understand the potential utility of the three scales in these populations; understanding patient-perceived significance was not in scope.The study cohorts included Medicare beneficiaries aged ???65 years as of 1 January of the year of their first cancer diagnosis with one or more health assessments in a community setting in the MCBS Access to Care data from 1991 to 2009. Beneficiaries had at least two diagnoses in de-identified Medicare claims data linked to the MCBS for one of the following cancers: pancreatic, lung, or MPN. The Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales were calculated to assess physical functioning over time from cancer diagnosis. Psychometric properties for each scale in each cohort were evaluated by testing for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and responsiveness by comparing differences in mean scale scores over time as cancer progresses, and differences in mean scale scores before and after hospitalization (for lung cancer cohort).The study cohorts included 90 patients with pancreatic cancer, 863 with lung cancer, and 135 with MPN. Among each cancer cohort, the Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha generally between 0.70 and 0.90) and test-retest reliability for consecutive surveys before diagnosis and consecutive surveys after diagnosis (when patients' functioning was more stable). Compared with mean scale scores at the survey 1-2 years before cancer diagnosis (baseline), mean scale scores at the first survey after cancer diagnosis were significantly higher (P < 0.05), indicating worsening, for Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales (items scored 0-1) (0.54 vs. 1.45, 1.15 vs. 2.20, and 2.29 vs. 3.08, respectively, for pancreatic cancer; 0.73 vs. 1.24, 1.29 vs. 2.01, and 2.41 vs. 2.85 for lung cancer; and 0.44 vs. 0.86, 0.87 vs. 1.36, and 1.87 vs. 2.32 for MPN). Among lung cancer patients, scale scores increased significantly following a hospitalization, suggesting a worsening of functional status.The Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales collected in the MCBS demonstrate acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability among patients with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and MPN, and are consistent with clinical worsening following diagnosis or hospitalization. These results suggest that using retrospective data may allow researchers to conduct preliminary assessments of existing PRO instruments in new populations of interest and generate useful exploratory disease information before embarking on de novo PRO development."
3,Economic evaluation of interventions for malignant neoplasms in Spain: systematic review and comparative analysis.,"To review standard methods used to evaluate the efficiency of oncology interventions, comparing their main characteristics with those of the studies aimed for other conditions.We performed a systematic review and comparative analysis calculating odds ratios (OR). We searched the biomedical literature to assess economic evaluation studies on malignant neoplasms in Spain published between 1983 and 2008. Their characteristics were reviewed and summarised, including the following variables: journal and year of publication, intervention, type and design of study, perspective, type of costs, financing source, and decision-making recommendations.Sixty-three studies were included. Main characteristics of the reports were: cost-effectiveness analysis and therapeutic interventions (60.3%; n=38). Seventeen studies (27.0%) used an observational design. Economic evaluations of malignant neoplasms showed the following associations (compared to those studies addressing other causes [n=411]): cost minimisation analysis (OR: 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-3.27), diagnostic interventions (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.07-4.43), decision analysis design (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.24-0.87), societal perspective (OR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.05-0.86) and for-profit source of financing (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.30-0.93).Economic evaluations of interventions for malignant neoplasms are not common despite the gradual increase produced during recent years in Spain. Reports presented heterogeneity in the quality of the information regarding the methods and the data sources used. Further efficiency evaluations of oncology interventions are needed and methodological quality should be warranted."
3,Molecular Pathology: Prognostic and Diagnostic Genomic Markers for Myeloid Neoplasms.,"Application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on myeloid neoplasms has expanded our knowledge of genomic alterations in this group of diseases. Genomic alterations in myeloid neoplasms are complex, heterogeneous, and not specific to a disease entity. NGS-based panel testing of myeloid neoplasms can complement existing diagnostic modalities and is gaining acceptance in the clinics and diagnostic laboratories. Prospective, randomized trials to evaluate the prognostic significance of genomic markers in myeloid neoplasms are under way in academic medical centers. "
3,Preoperative platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio improves the performance of the international consensus guidelines in predicting malignant pancreatic cystic neoplasms.,"To determine if neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were predictive of malignancy in pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) and if these improved the performance of the international consensus guidelines (ICG) in the initial triage of these patients.318 patients with surgically-treated suspected PCN were retrospectively reviewed. Malignant neoplasms were defined as neoplasms harbouring invasive carcinoma. The optimal cut-off for NLR and PLR were determined by plotting the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves of NLR/PLR in predicting malignant PCN and utilizing the Youden index.The optimal NLR and PLR cut-offs were determined to be 3.33 and 205, respectively. Univariate analyses demonstrated that symptomatic PCNs, age, obstructive jaundice, presence of solid component, dilatation of main pancreatic duct ???10??mm, high NLR and high PLR were predictive of a malignant PCN. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that obstructive jaundice, presence of solid component, MPD ???10??mm and high PLR but not NLR were independent predictors of a malignant PCN. A high PLR significantly predicted invasive carcinoma in patients classified within the ICG(HR) group. Comparison between the ROC curves of the ICG versus ICG plus high PLR in predicting malignant PCN demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the ICG when PLR was included [AUC 0.784 (95% CI: 0.740-0.829) vs AUC 0.822 (95% CI: 0.772-0.872) (p??=??0.0032)].High PLR is an independent predictor of malignancy in PCN. The addition of PLR as a criterion to the ICG improved the accuracy of these guidelines in detecting invasive neoplasms."
3,Which is the best current guideline for the diagnosis and management of cystic pancreatic neoplasms? An appraisal using evidence-based practice methods.,"Cystic pancreatic neoplasms (CPNs) are an increasingly diagnosed entity. Their heterogeneity poses complex diagnostic and management challenges. Despite frequently encountering these entities, particularly in the context of the increased imaging of patients in modern medicine, doctors have to rely on incomplete and ambiguous published literature. The aim of this project was to review the guidelines relating to CPNs using evidence-based practice (EBP) methods.A search of both the primary and secondary literature was performed. Five sets of guidelines were identified which were then methodologically appraised by the AGREE II instrument, a validated and widely utilised tool for guideline development assessment.The 2014 'Italian consensus guidelines for the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of cystic pancreatic neoplasms' were found to be the most methodologically sound guidelines, on the basis of both the overall score and average weighted domain score.The current best guidelines were identified. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument can be used for retrospective review of published guidelines or as a roadmap for guideline-writing groups. All guidelines found were methodologically limited. Further longitudinal/prospective studies are required to improve the level of evidence.?€? Cystic pancreatic neoplasms (CPNs) are an increasingly encountered entity in modern medicine. ?€? Clinical uncertainty remains with regard to optimal diagnostic and management strategies. ?€? The Italian consensus guidelines for cystic pancreatic neoplasms are currently the best guidelines."
3,The serum pepsinogen levels for risk assessment of gastric neoplasms: New proposal from a case-control study in Korea.,"To decrease the gastric cancer related mortality rate, endoscopic screening is widely performed in Korea. However, a precise method for identifying those at a high risk of gastric neoplasms has not been established. This study aims to evaluate serum pepsinogen (PG) levels for risk assessment of gastric neoplasms. Between August 2014 and March 2016, a total of 398 subjects, including 87 with gastric neoplasms, were enrolled in this study. On the basis of the serum PG I/II ratio, the enrolled subjects were classified into 4 groups: group A, PG I/II ratio >4; group B, >3 and ???4; group C, >2 and ???3; group D, ???2. Compared with group A, a stepwise increase in the risk of gastric neoplasm was observed from group B [odds ratio (OR) = 9.9, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 4.0-24.4] to group C (OR = 20.9, 95% CI = 8.7-50.5) to group D (OR = 37.3, 95% CI = 14.3-97.4). The optimal cutoff value of the serum PG I/II ratio for predicting gastric neoplasms was 4.5, with a sensitivity of 97.7% and a specificity of 57.6%. A decrease in the serum PG I/II ratio was strongly associated with an increased risk of gastric neoplasms. The serum PG I/II ratio can be used to identify those at a high risk of gastric neoplasms in Korean population."
3,Neoplasms of the Appendix: Pictorial Review with Clinical and Pathologic Correlation.,"Appendiceal neoplasms are uncommon tumors of the gastrointestinal tract that may manifest with symptoms of appendicitis, right lower quadrant pain, or palpable mass, leading to imaging or surgical intervention. The majority of appendiceal masses consist of primary epithelial neoplasms and neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Epithelial neoplasms-mucinous and nonmucinous types-are more often detected at imaging than NETs due to their larger size and propensity for peritoneal spread and metastatic disease. Epithelial mucinous neoplasms are defined by the presence of mucin, detected at radiologic and pathologic examination. A mucocele or pseudomyxoma peritonei from epithelial mucinous tumors are the two most common cross-sectional imaging findings of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. Nonmucinous epithelial tumors are less common and manifest as masses similar to colonic-type malignancies. NETs are often discovered incidentally at appendectomy due to their small size and nonaggressive behavior. Imaging findings of primary appendiceal tumors may overlap with those of acute appendicitis. Additionally, an appendiceal mass may cause acute appendicitis, obscuring the underlying mass. Other neoplasms including lymphoma, sarcoma, mesenchymal and nerve sheath tumors, or secondary malignant involvement of the appendix are rare. Treatment depends on the histologic subtype and extent of disease. Detailed description of organ, nodal, and peritoneal involvement informs surgical management with the goal of complete cytoreduction. Novel treatments such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy have increased survival for patients with mucinous tumors. <sup>??</sup>RSNA, 2017."
3,Perspectives on testicular sex cord-stromal tumors and those composed of both germ cells and sex cord-stromal derivatives with a comparison to corresponding ovarian neoplasms.,"Sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs) are the second most frequent category of testicular neoplasms, accounting for approximately 2% to 5% of cases. Both genetic and epigenetic factors account for the differences in frequency and histologic composition between testicular and ovarian SCSTs. For example, large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumor and intratubular large cell hyalinizing Sertoli cell neoplasia occur in the testis but have not been described in the ovary. In this article, we discuss recently described diagnostic entities as well as inconsistencies in nomenclature used in the recent World Health Organization classifications of SCSTs in the testis and ovary. We also thoroughly review the topic of neoplasms composed of both germ cells and sex cord derivatives with an emphasis on controversial aspects. These include ""dissecting gonadoblastoma"" and testicular mixed germ cell-sex cord stromal tumor (MGC-SCST). The former is a recently described variant of gonadoblastoma that sometimes is an immediate precursor of germinoma in the dysgenetic gonads of patients with a disorder of sex development. Although the relationship of dissecting gonadoblastoma to the previously described undifferentiated gonadal tissue is complex and not entirely resolved, we believe that it is preferable to continue to use the term undifferentiated gonadal tissue for those cases that are not neoplastic and are considered to be the precursor of classical gonadoblastoma. Although the existence of testicular MGC-SCST has been challenged, the most recent evidence supports its existence; however, testicular MGC-SCST differs significantly from ovarian examples due to both genetic and epigenetic factors."
3,Soft Tissue Neoplasms Causing Apparent Venous Thoracic Outlet Syndrome.,"Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) usually results from compression of the subclavian vein classically as a result of narrowing of the costoclavicular space. We report 2 rare cases of soft tissue neoplasms resulting in apparent vTOS. The first case is a 46-year-old female with a 2-year history of intermittent unilateral shoulder pain, who was initially diagnosed with intervertebral disk herniation. Cervical fusion was performed; however, her symptoms progressed and she additionally developed paresthesias and venous congestion. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram demonstrated a 13-cm-encapsulated mass within the subscapularis muscle compressing the axillary vein. Radiological findings suggested lipoma. She subsequently underwent complete resection via a transaxillary approach with extension along the lateral border of the latissimus. Final pathology confirmed an intramuscular lipoma. The second case is a 21-year-old female who presented with acute onset of unilateral chest wall pain, palpable nodularity, and venous congestion. CT chest showed pulmonary embolism and an anterior chest wall mass. An initial attempt at resection was aborted due to proximity of the mass to the subclavian vein. The mass enlarged on serial imaging, measuring 3.8??cm in greatest dimension. Additionally, tumor thrombus was seen, and a subsequent ultrasound-guided biopsy was positive for high-grade synovial sarcoma. Positron emission tomography scan showed a pulmonary nodule that was resected thoracoscopically with pathology confirming metastatic synovial sarcoma. Subsequently, she underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by successful resection of the chest wall mass. An extended infraclavicular approach with a secondary transaxillary incision was utilized to achieve adequate exposure and margins. Final pathology was consistent with preoperative biopsy. Venous reconstruction was not needed. Although rare, an extrinsic mass as a cause of apparent TOS should be in the differential diagnosis. Surgical approach is based on tumor type, location, and proximity to the neurovascular bundle."
3,Agreement Between Cytology and Histopathology for Regional Lymph Node Metastasis in Dogs With Melanocytic Neoplasms.,"Melanocytic neoplasms are common in dogs and frequently occur within the oral cavity or in haired skin. The behavior of melanocytic neoplasms is variable and depends on tumor location, size, and histopathologic features. This study compared cytopathology and histopathology of 32 lymph nodes from 27 dogs diagnosed with melanocytic neoplasms. Agreement between the original cytology report, cytology slide review, original histopathology report, and histopathology slide review was determined for each lymph node. A subset of lymph nodes was subjected to immunohistochemistry (Melan-A) and additional histochemical stains/techniques (Prussian blue, bleach) to assist in differentiation of melanocytes and melanophages. Agreement ranged from slight to fair for each of the variables evaluated with weighted kappa (??<sub>w</sub>) or kappa (??) analysis (original cytology vs cytology review ??<sub>w</sub> = 0.24; original cytology vs original histopathology ??<sub>w</sub> = 0.007; original cytology vs histopathology review ??<sub>w</sub> = 0.23; cytology review vs original histopathology ??<sub>w</sub> = 0.008; cytology review vs histopathology review ??<sub>w</sub> = 0.006; and original histopathology vs histopathology review ?? = 0.18). The diagnoses (metastatic, equivocal, or negative for metastasis) of the original report and slide review for both cytology and histopathology were not significantly correlated with survival in this population of patients. Overall, agreement between cytology and histopathology was poor even with a single clinical or anatomic pathologist performing slide review. Consensus between routine cytology and histopathology for staging of lymph nodes in patients with melanocytic neoplasms is poor and does not correlate with survival."
3,Analysis of Appendiceal Neoplasms on 3544 Appendectomy Specimens for Acute Appendicitis: Retrospective Cohort Study of a Single Institution.,"BACKGROUND Appendiceal neoplasms are rare and generally determined in appendectomy specimens for acute appendicitis. Depending on a tumor's histopathology and size, appendectomy or right hemicolectomy are the surgical treatment options. Adenocarcinomas, mucinous neoplasms, goblet cell carcinoids and neuroendocrine tumors are the types of the primary appendiceal neoplasm histopathology. In this study, we aimed to determine the incidence of appendiceal neoplasms in an acute appendicitis cohort. Also, histopathological distributions, demographic data, preoperative radiological diagnosis, and intraoperative findings were revealed for analysis, retrospectively. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between October 2011 and September 2017, 3554 appendectomies were performed for acute appendicitis in Bezmialem University Hospital, Istanbul Turkey. The medical records of these consecutive 3554 patients were evaluated retrospectively. After the histopathological analysis of the appendectomy specimens, a total of 28 patients were detected as having appendiceal neoplasm including appendiceal adenocarcinoma, low grade mucinous neoplasia, and appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors. RESULTS Appendiceal neoplasms were determined in 28 out of 3554 acute appendicitis patients with an incidence of 0.78%. According to the histopathological types, 3 of the cases (10.7%) were appendiceal adenocarcinoma, 8 of the cases (28.5%) were low grade mucinous neoplasia, and 17 of the cases (60.8%) were neuroendocrine tumors. The overall incidence of the appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors was 0.48%. CONCLUSIONS The information obtained from our study suggests that pathological examination of the specimen may not be necessary if there is no doubt according to preoperative radiological diagnosis and/or intraoperative findings of the surgeon."
3,"Immunohistochemical Biomarkers of Gastrointestinal, Pancreatic, Pulmonary, and Thymic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.","Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a heterogeneous group of epithelial neoplastic proliferations that irrespective of their primary site share features of neural and endocrine differentiation including the presence of secretory granules, synaptic-like vesicles, and the ability to produce amine and/or peptide hormones. NENs encompass a wide spectrum of neoplasms ranging from well-differentiated indolent tumors to highly aggressive poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas. Most cases arise in the digestive system and in thoracic organs, i.e., the lung and thymus. A correct diagnostic approach is crucial for the management of patients with both digestive and thoracic NENs, because their high clinical and biological heterogeneity is related to their prognosis and response to therapy. In this context, immunohistochemistry represents an indispensable diagnostic tool that pathologists need to use for the correct diagnosis and classification of such neoplasms. In addition, immunohistochemistry is also useful in identifying prognostic and theranostic markers. In the present article, the authors will review the role of immunohistochemistry in the routine workup of digestive and thoracic NENs."
3,New Strategies in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms: The Evolving Genetic and Therapeutic Landscape.,"The classical BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) include essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and myelofibrosis (MF). Although these clonal disorders share certain clinical and genetic features, MF in particular is distinct for its complex mutational landscape, severe disease phenotype, and poor prognosis. The genetic complexity inherent to MF has made this disease extremely challenging to treat. Pharmacologic JAK inhibition has proven to be a transformative therapy in MPNs, alleviating symptom burden and improving survival, but has been hampered by off-target toxicities and, as monotherapy, has shown limited effects on mutant allele burden. In this review, we discuss the genetic heterogeneity contributing to the pathogenesis of MPNs, focusing on novel driver and epigenetic mutations and how they relate to combination therapeutic strategies. We discuss results from ongoing studies of new JAK inhibitors and report on new drugs and drug combinations that have demonstrated success in early preclinical and clinical trials, including type II JAK inhibitors, antifibrotic agents, and telomerase inhibitors."
3,Pyrosequencing-based quantitative measurement of CALR mutation allele burdens and their clinical implications in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.,"We developed a pyrosequencing-based method for the quantification of CALR mutations and compared the results using Sanger sequencing, fragment length analysis (FLA), digital-droplet PCR (ddPCR), and next-generation sequencing (NGS).Method validation studies were performed using cloned plasmid controls. Samples from 24 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms were evaluated.Among the 24 patients, 15 had CALR mutations (7 type 1, 2 type 2, and 6 other mutations). The type 1 or type 2 mutation-positive results from pyrosequencing exhibited 100% concordance with the Sanger sequencing results. One novel CALR mutation was not detected by pyrosequencing. The CALR mutation allele burdens measured by pyrosequencing were slightly lower than those measured by FLA but slightly higher than the results obtained using ddPCR. Pyrosequencing exhibited high correlations with both methods. The mutation allele burdens estimated by NGS were significantly lower than those measured by pyrosequencing. An increased CALR mutation allele burden was associated with overt primary myelofibrosis. Patients with >70% mutation allele burdens in myeloid cells had a significantly longer time from diagnosis (P?€?=?€?0.007), more bone marrow fibrosis (P?€?=?€?0.010), and lower hemoglobin (P?€?=?€?0.007).Pyrosequencing was a useful rapid sequencing method to determine the burden of CALR mutations."
3,Pediatric Hepatobiliary Neoplasms: An Overview and Update.,"Recent developments regarding the treatment of pediatric liver tumors have significantly improved patient care. Stimulated by collaboration between international pediatric groups, advances have been made in surgical techniques, transplantation options, and chemotherapy schemas. In light of this progress, clear understanding of the state-of-the-art imaging evaluation of hepatobiliary tumors has become even more integral to the effective management of children with hepatic neoplasms. The unique imaging features of hepatic neoplasms in the pediatric population, when coupled with supportive demographic data and laboratory findings, can lead to accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of hepatobiliary tumors."
3,"Synchronous Quadruple Primary Neoplasms: Colon Adenocarcinoma, Collision Tumor of Neuroendocrine Tumor and Schwann Cell Hamartoma and Sessile Serrated Adenoma of the Appendix.","Quadruple synchronous primary neoplasms are very rare with only three cases reported in the English-speaking literature to date. Collision tumors are also rare entities, especially of the appendix. We herein report a case of synchronous quadruple primary neoplasm in a 95-year-old female. She was diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma, sessile serrated adenoma of the appendix and a collision tumor composed of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor and Schwann cell hamartoma. Histological examination and immunohistochemistry supported these four lesions as separate entities. This case is unique because we report the diagnosis of quadruple synchronous primary, an extremely rare occurrence, in addition to a collision tumor of the appendix. We also provide a review of the literature for synchronous neoplasms and collision tumors. "
3,Ampullary neuroendocrine neoplasms: surgical experience of a rare and challenging entity.,"Ampullary neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) account for <?€?0.3% of gastrointestinal NENs. Surgical options include transduodenal ampullectomy/tumour excision or pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). We report the experience of two high-volume pancreatic surgical centres of ampullary NENs.Clinical records of patients who underwent surgery for ampullary NENs (January 2007-November 2017) in the study centres were retrieved retrospectively. We evaluated clinical-pathological features, post-operative outcome and follow-up (FU).Eighteen patients (9 M/9 F, averaging 62??years) were enrolled. All but one were non-functioning NENs; four (22%) patients presented with jaundice. Seven (39%) of the patients underwent ampullectomy/excision (median tumour size 1.5??cm), and 11 (61%) patients underwent PD (median tumour size 2.4??cm). The median operation time of ampullectomy/excision was 221??min with operative blood loss of 75??ml (vs. 506??min and 425??ml in PD). The median hospital stay was 10??days in both groups. Overall surgical morbidity was 33%, due to four biochemical leaks, one pancreatic fistula and one abdominal haemorrhage. No reoperations were needed. The median tumour size was 1.8 (range 0.5-6.7)??cm. All G2-G3 NENs were N1 (vs. 1/7 in G1 NENs). Three (17%) cases were mixed exocrine/G3 NECs. After a median FU of 45 (up to 124)??months, recurrence occurred in four G3 NEC (31%) patients (median disease-free survival 14??months) after an R0 PD. Disease-related survival was 93, 77 and 66% at 1, 3 and 5??years, respectively.Ampullary NENs are mostly G1-G2 neoplasms. Lymph node metastases rarely occur in G1 NENs <?€?2??cm in size, which may be treated with ampullectomy/excision. Survival is 66% 5??years after surgery."
3,Analysis of risk factors of lymph node metastasis in rectal neuroendocrine neoplasms using multicenter data.,"This study was conducted to analyze the risk factors associated with lymph node metastasis in rectal neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs).A total of 419 patients with rectal NENs were enrolled. A univariate analysis of risk factors of lymph node metastasis was conducted using a ??<sup>2</sup> test, and a multivariate analysis was conducted using a logistic regression analysis.Univariate and multivariate regression analysis revealed that tumor size, G grade and the depth of tumor invasion were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis (p??<??0.05).Rectal NENs patients with a larger tumor size, deeper tumor invasion or a higher G grade had a higher risk of regional lymph node metastasis."
3,Computed tomography-guided percutaneous biopsy for vertebral neoplasms: a department's experience and hybrid biopsy technique to improve yield.,"OBJECTIVE Recent articles have identified the poor diagnostic yield of percutaneous needle biopsy for vertebral osteomyelitis. The current study aimed to confirm the higher accuracy of CT-guided spinal biopsy for vertebral neoplasms and to identify which biopsy technique provides the highest yield. METHODS Over a 9-year period, the radiology department at University Hospitals Case Medical Center performed 222 CT-guided biopsies of vertebral lesions, of which clinicians indicated a concern for vertebral neoplasms in 122 patients. A retrospective chart review was performed to confirm the higher sensitivity of the percutaneous intervention for vertebral neoplasms. RESULTS A core sample was obtained for all 122 biopsies of concern (100.0%). Only 6 cases (4.9%) were reported as nondiagnostic per histological sampling, and 12 cases (9.8%) were negative for disease. The question of vertebral neoplastic involvement warrants follow-up, and the current study was able to determine the subsequent diagnosis of each lesion. Of the 122 total, 94 (77.0%) core samples provided true-positive results, and the sensitivity of core biopsy measured 87.9%. The technical approach did not demonstrate any significant difference in diagnostic yield. However, when the vertebral cortex was initially pierced with a coaxial bone biopsy system and subsequently a 14-gauge spring-loaded cutting biopsy needle was coaxially advanced into lytic lesions, 14 true positives were obtained with a corresponding sensitivity of 100.0%. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the higher sensitivity of image-guided percutaneous needle biopsy for vertebral neoplasms. In addition, it demonstrates how the use of a novel cutting needle biopsy approach, performed coaxially through a core biopsy track, provides the highest yield. "
3,Advances in the Genetic Characterization of Cutaneous Mesenchymal Neoplasms: Implications for Tumor Classification and Novel Diagnostic Markers.,"Cutaneous mesenchymal neoplasms often pose significant diagnostic challenges; many such entities are rare or show clinical and histologic overlap with both other mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal lesions. Recent advances in the genetic classification of many cutaneous mesenchymal neoplasms have not only helped define unique pathologic entities and increase our understanding of their biology, but have also provided new diagnostic markers. This review details these recent discoveries, with a focus on their implications for tumor classification and diagnosis."
3,Expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in thymic epithelial neoplasms.,"Thymic epithelial neoplasms are rare tumors that are difficult to diagnose and treat. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand (PD-L1) are expressed by various malignancies and are considered a prognostic factor and immunotherapeutic target. We examined the expression of both antibodies in 100 thymic epithelial neoplasms to assess their use as a biomarker and to correlate their expression with clinicopathological parameters. Whole-tissue sections of 74 thymomas and 26 thymic carcinomas were examined. Expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and scored by the percentage of positive T-cells or tumor cells, respectively. Cases with strong membranous reactivity of the antibody in ???5% of T-cells (PD-1) or tumor cells (PD-L1), respectively, were considered positive. Expression of PD-1 was detected in 52/100 cases (52%) including 6/26 thymic carcinomas (23%) and 46/74 thymomas (62%). PD-L1 was positive in 61/100 cases (61%) including 14/26 thymic carcinomas (54%) and 47/74 thymomas (64%). A total of 82 cases (82%) showed expression of PD-1 or PD-L1. PD-1<sup>+</sup> cases were associated with higher stage in thymic carcinoma (P=0.01) and PD-1<sup>-</sup> cases with thymic carcinoma histology (P=0.0014), whereas PD-L1<sup>+</sup> cases were associated with neoadjuvant therapy in thymoma (P=0.0065). There was no statistical difference between PD-1 or PD-L1 expression status and other clinicopathological parameters including overall survival. PD-1 and/or PD-L1 are expressed in up to 82% of thymic epithelial neoplasms. These results confirm that these tumors should be considered for PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapy, however their predictive value in terms of prognosis remains uncertain."
3,[The impact of public health system on mortality of malignant neoplasms in Voronezh oblast].,"The total mortality and population mortality of main classes of diseases and single causes of death are to be considered in operative and strategic planning of development of national economy and industry In the Russian Federation, the decrease of mortality of neoplasms including malignant ones up to 190 per 100 000 of population in 2020 will be one of indicators of effectiveness of implementation of the State program of development of public health in the Russian Federation. The study was organized to determine the possibility to impact the level and dynamics of mortality of malignant neoplasms by means of variation of managed factors on the basis of indicators of activity of public health system. The main indicators of population health and activity of health institutions of Voronezh oblast were analyzed. The methods of mathematical statistics, management theory, system analysis and mathematical modeling were applied. To study the impact of managed factors on mortality of malignant neoplasms on the territory of Voronezh oblast the analysis of correlation interdependency was applied concerning 162 factors characterizing condition and activity of public health system according oblast districts and level of mortality of malignant neoplasms among adult population. The combinations of factors were calculated using the model to determine the level of prospective mortality to come in certain time after implementation of activities changing the given levels of factors. The data concerning qualitative interrelationship of indicators of condition and functioning of network of health institutions with indicators of level and dynamics of mortality of malignant neoplasms can be applied to model and forecast and to evaluate the current and forthcoming situation according indicators of mentioned mortality on the territory of Voronezh oblast in development of comprehensive plan of activities targeted to decreasing of this indicator."
3,Casitas B-lineage lymphoma linker helix mutations found in myeloproliferative neoplasms affect conformation.,"Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl or c-Cbl) is a RING ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) signalling. Phosphorylation of a conserved residue (Tyr371) on the linker helix region (LHR) between the substrate-binding and RING domains is required to ubiquitinate PTKs, thereby flagging them for degradation. This conserved Tyr is a mutational hotspot in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Previous studies have revealed that select point mutations in Tyr371 can potentiate transformation in cells and mice but not all possible mutations do so. To trigger oncogenic potential, Cbl Tyr371 mutants must perturb the LHR-substrate-binding domain interaction and eliminate PTK ubiquitination. Although structures of native and pTyr371-Cbl are available, they do not reveal how Tyr371 mutations affect Cbl's conformation. Here, we investigate how Tyr371 mutations affect Cbl's conformation in solution and how this relates to Cbl's ability to potentiate transformation in cells.To explore how Tyr371 mutations affect Cbl's properties, we used surface plasmon resonance to measure Cbl mutant binding affinities for E2 conjugated with ubiquitin (E2-Ub), small angle X-ray scattering studies to investigate Cbl mutant conformation in solution and focus formation assays to assay Cbl mutant transformation potential in cells. Cbl Tyr371 mutants enhance E2-Ub binding and cause Cbl to adopt extended conformations in solution. LHR flexibility, RING domain accessibility and transformation potential are associated with the extent of LHR-substrate-binding domain perturbation affected by the chemical nature of the mutation. More disruptive mutants like Cbl Y371D or Y371S are more extended and the RING domain is more accessible, whereas Cbl Y371F mimics native Cbl in solution. Correspondingly, the only Tyr371 mutants that potentiate transformation in cells are those that perturb the LHR-substrate-binding domain interaction.c-Cbl's LHR mutations are only oncogenic when they disrupt the native state and fail to ubiquitinate PTKs. These findings provide new insights into how LHR mutations deregulate c-Cbl."
3,Abdominal wall reconstruction following resection of large abdominal aggressive neoplasms using tensor fascia lata flap with or without mesh reinforcement.,"Abdominal wall defects caused by neoplasms with large extended resection defects remain a challenging problem. Autologous flaps, meshes, and component separation techniques are effective in reconstructing these defects. We retrospectively reviewed and assessed the success of reconstruction using tensor fascia lata flap with or without meshes.18 patients with abdominal wall neoplasms were identified during the period from 2007 to 2016. A retrospective review of office charts and hospital records was performed.A total of 18 patients received corresponding treatment according to the degree of defects, with a mean age of 53.89??????14.56??years old, a mean body mass index (BMI) of 22.89??????4.09??kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and a mean American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score of 2.18??????0.75. Operative details included the mean defect size (303.44??????175.67??cm<sup>2</sup>), the mean mesh size (265.92??????227.99??cm<sup>2</sup>), and the mean operative time (382.33??????180.38??min). Postoperative wound complications were identified in 7 (39%) patients, including incisional infection, edema and thrombus. Neoplasm recurrence was observed in 2 (13%) primary neoplasms patients. No hernias were present in any patient.Abdominal wall defects caused by neoplasms should be repaired by autologous flaps combined with or without mesh reinforcement. Most type I defects should be primary sutured; type II or III defects should be repaired well by flaps, with or without mesh; if the incision is infected or contaminated, biological mesh or flaps are the best choice."
3,IASLC/ITMIG Staging System and Lymph Node Map for Thymic Epithelial Neoplasms.,"Thymic epithelial neoplasms are rare malignancies that arise from the thymus and include thymoma, thymic carcinoma, and thymic neuroendocrine tumors. At least 15 different stage classifications have been proposed for thymic epithelial neoplasms and used to varying degrees in clinical practice, many of which have been constructed from small groups of patients. Traditionally, the Masaoka and Masaoka-Koga staging systems have been the schemes most commonly employed, and the latter has been recommended for use by the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group (ITMIG). An official, consistent stage classification system has recently been recognized by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), which are responsible for defining stage classifications for neoplasms. To establish this stage classification system, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) and ITMIG amassed a large retrospective database and evaluated this group of cases to develop proposals for the eighth edition of the stage classification manuals. For this endeavor, IASLC provided funding and statistical analysis and ITMIG provided the involvement of the clinicians and researchers actively participating in the study of thymic epithelial neoplasms. To accomplish this, a Thymic Domain of the Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee (TD-SPFC) was established to formulate the rationale, methodology, and definitions of this tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system, which is presented in this article. <sup>??</sup> RSNA, 2017."
3,Spontaneous neoplasms in captive Virginia opossums ( Didelphis virginiana): a retrospective case series (1989-2014) and review of the literature.,"This retrospective project summarizes the types of neoplasms identified in Virginia opossums ( Didelphis virginiana) presented to the University of Tennessee, College of Veterinary Medicine (UTCVM) postmortem service in 1989-2014 and serves as a review of the literature. Of the 85 Virginia opossums identified from the UTCVM case database, there were 17 diagnoses of neoplasia from 12 cases (14%). These cases included 8 females, 2 males, and 2 neutered males. All opossums with known ages (11 of 12) were >2 y old. Pulmonary tumors, specifically minimally invasive or lepidic-predominant adenocarcinomas, were the most common diagnosis and accounted for 53% (9 of 17) of the neoplasms. Additional tumors included acute myeloid leukemia with eosinophil maturation, hepatic hemangiosarcoma, sarcoma (unknown origin), squamous cell carcinoma, disseminated mast cell tumor, trichoblastoma, thyroid adenoma, and an osteoma. These findings serve as a reference for the types of spontaneous neoplasms in Virginia opossums; based on these findings, neoplasia should be considered as a differential in mature captive Virginia opossums."
3,Gallbladder papillary neoplasms share pathological features with intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct.,"Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) has been widely recognized. However, the knowledge of intracystic papillary neoplasm of the gallbladder (IPNG) including papillary adenoma and adenocarcinoma is not well defined. In this study, we compared the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features between 32 IPNG cases and 32 IPNB cases. IPNG-1 (low-high grade dysplasia) exhibited an earlier onset age, smaller tumor size and lower level of CK20 expression compared to IPNG-2 (invasive carcinoma). Histologically, pancreaticobiliary and intestinal subtype accounted for nearly half of IPNG or IPNB (44.4% and 48.1% vs. 44.0% and 44.0%), respectively. Immunohistochemically, 88.9% of IPNG and 92.0% of IPNB cases were positive for MUC1, and 96.3% and 92.0% for CK7, respectively. CDX2 and MUC2 were more highly expressed in the intestinal subtype than in other subtypes. CK20 expression increased in parallel with tumor progression. In addition, 53.1% of IPNG cases and 68.6% of IPNB cases exhibited invasive carcinoma, and showed significant survival advantages to conventional gallbladder adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, respectively. In conclusion, papillary adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder can be recognized as different pathological stages of IPNG, and they share pathological features with IPNB."
3,Pancreatic involvement by metastasizing neoplasms as determined by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration: A clinicopathologic characterization.,"Pancreatic tumors often represent primary neoplasms, however organ involvement with metastatic disease can occur. The use of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) to determine the underlying pathology provides guidance of clinical management.25 cases were identified in a retrospective review of our institution's records from 2006 to 2016. Clinical parameters and prognosis are described.Metastatic lesions to the pancreas diagnosed by EUS-FNA accounted for 4.2% of all pancreatic neoplastic diagnoses, each lesion had a median greatest dimension of 1.5 cm, were most often located in the head of the pancreas, and by EUS were typically hypoechoic masses with variably defined borders. Patients were of a median age of 64 years old at diagnosis of the metastatic lesion(s) and the mean interval from primary diagnosis to the diagnosis of metastasis to the pancreas was 58.7 months (95% confidence interval, CI, 35.4 to 82.0 months). The rates of 24-month overall survival after diagnoses of metastatic renal cell carcinoma or all other neoplasms to the pancreas were 90% and 7% respectively. The origin of the neoplasms included the kidney (n?€?=?€?10), colon (n?€?=?€?4), ovary (n?€?=?€?3), lung (n?€?=?€?2), et al. Smear-based cytomorphology, and a combination of histomorphology and immunohistochemical studies from cell block preparations showed features consistent with the neoplasm of derivation.Metastases to the pancreas can be diagnosed via EUS-FNA, with enough specimen to conduct immunohistochemical studies if necessary to delineate origin. The determination of metastatic disease to the pancreas alters management and prognosis of the patient. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2017;45:418-425. ?? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
3,Sunitinib shrinks NET-G3 pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.,"The 2017 revised World Health Organization classification of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms classified conventional G3 tumors into well-differentiated (NET-G3) and poorly differentiated (NEC-G3) tumors. However, guidelines for selection of drug therapy were not established in the 2017 revision. This study aimed to elucidate the rates of maximum tumor reduction of sunitinib, progression-free survival, and overall survival in the new classification.We investigated the reduction rate over time using computed tomography for 60 patients with unresectable or distant metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms who received 37.5??mg of sunitinib in our department from April 2013 to November 2017.Of the 60 cases, 42, 10, and 5 were NET-G1/G2, NET-G3, and NEC-G3, respectively. The prognostic factors were analyzed according to clinicopathological factors using the Cox hazard model. The median observation period was 19 months, and the median duration of sunitinib administration was 7 months. The median maximum reduction rate of sunitinib was 18.3%. Tumor response was classified according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors: 20 cases (33.3%) showed partial response, 29 cases (48.3%) showed stable disease, and 11 cases (18.3%) showed progressive disease. In a multivariate analysis of factors contributing to progression-free survival from the start of sunitinib administration, only histologically poor differentiation was a significant factor (p?€?=?€?0.010). Progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly better in patients with NET-G3 than that in patients with NEC-G3 (p?€?=?€?0.005, p?€?=?€?0.012), while it was not different between those with NET-G3 and those with NET-G1/2.Our results indicate that sunitinib is as effective for NET-G3 as for NET-G1/2."
3,Second malignant neoplasms: assessment and strategies for risk reduction.,"Improvements in early detection, supportive care, and treatment have resulted in an increasing number of cancer survivors, with a current 5-year relative survival rate for all cancers combined of approximately 66.1%. For some patients, these survival advances have been offset by the long-term late effects of cancer and its treatment, with second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) comprising one of the most potentially life-threatening sequelae. The number of patients with SMNs is growing, with new SMNs now representing about one in six of all cancers reported to the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. SMNs reflect not only the late effects of therapy but also the influence of shared etiologic factors (in particular, tobacco and excessive alcohol intake), genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures, host effects, and combinations of factors, including gene-environment interactions. For selected SMNs, risk is also modified by age at exposure and attained age. SMNs can be categorized into three major groups according to the predominant etiologic factor(s): (1) treatment-related, (2) syndromic, and (3) those due to shared etiologic exposures, although the nonexclusivity of these groups should be underscored. Here we provide an overview of SMNs in survivors of adult-onset cancer, summarizing the current, albeit limited, clinical evidence with regard to screening and prevention, with a focus on the provision of guidance for health care providers. The growing number of patients with second (and higher-order) cancers mandates that we also further probe etiologic influences and genetic variants that heighten risk, and that we better define high-risk groups for targeted preventive and interventional clinical strategies."
3,Philadelphia chromosome-negative classical myeloproliferative neoplasms: revised management recommendations from European LeukemiaNet.,"This document updates the recommendations on the management of Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-neg MPNs) published in 2011 by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) consortium. Recommendations were produced by multiple-step formalized procedures of group discussion. A critical appraisal of evidence by using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was performed in the areas where at least one randomized clinical trial was published. Seven randomized controlled trials provided the evidence base; earlier phase trials also informed recommendation development. Key differences from the 2011 diagnostic recommendations included: lower threshold values for hemoglobin and hematocrit and bone marrow examination for diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV), according to the revised WHO criteria; the search for complementary clonal markers, such as ASXL1, EZH2, IDH1/IDH2, and SRSF2 for the diagnosis of myelofibrosis (MF) in patients who test negative for JAK2V617, CALR or MPL driver mutations. Regarding key differences of therapy recommendations, both recombinant interferon alpha and the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib are recommended as second-line therapies for PV patients who are intolerant or have inadequate response to hydroxyurea. Ruxolitinib is recommended as first-line approach for MF-associated splenomegaly in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk disease; in case of intermediate-1 disease, ruxolitinib is recommended in highly symptomatic splenomegaly. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is recommended for transplant-eligible MF patients with high or intermediate-2 risk score. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is also recommended for transplant-eligible MF patients with intermediate-1 risk score who present with either refractory, transfusion-dependent anemia, blasts in peripheral blood?€?>?€?2%, adverse cytogenetics, or high-risk mutations. In these situations, the transplant procedure should be performed in a controlled setting."
3,"Ultrasound-guided percutaneous fine-needle aspiration of solid pancreatic neoplasms: 10-year experience with more than 2,000 cases and a review of the literature.","To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and complication rate of percutaneous ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA) of solid pancreatic neoplasms through the analysis of 10-year experiences of two centres.Clinical, radiological and pathologic data of 2,024 patients with solid pancreatic masses who underwent US-FNAs were retrospectively evaluated. Indications for aspiration were: unresectable lesions before neo-adjuvant therapy; doubtful imaging findings; and suspicion of uncommon neoplasms with prognostic or therapeutic implications such as metastases or lymphoma. US-FNAs were performed using aspiration needles with a cytopathologist present in centre 1. In centre 2, cytologic samples were collected with Chiba needles and separately evaluated by a cytopathologist.US-FNA had a diagnostic sample rate of 92.2??% (centre 1: 95.9??%; centre 2: 87.2??%). US-FNA repetition after non-diagnostic samples provided a diagnosis in 86.3??% of cases. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were 98.7??%, 100??%, 100??%, 75.5??%, and 98.7??%, respectively. The complication rate was 0.8??%.Percutaneous US-FNA is a sensitive, accurate and safe method for the invasive diagnosis of solid pancreatic neoplasms. The use of aspiration needles and the on-site presence of a cytopathologist may lead to a high rate of diagnostic samples, thus reducing the need for US-FNA repetition.?€? Percutaneous ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic neoplasms is sensitive and accurate. ?€? The short-term complication rate of percutaneous ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is low. ?€? Technical aspects may influence the rate of diagnostic samples."

3,Distribution of lymphoid neoplasms in Northwest China: Analysis of 3244 cases according to WHO classification in a single institution.,"To explore the distribution of lymphoid neoplasms in Northwest China, the clinical and pathological data of lymphoma patients from 2006 to 2014 were analyzed according to the WHO classification in Xijing Hospital. Of the 3244 cases, mature B-cell neoplasms occupied 60.7%, while mature T/NK-cell neoplasms and Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) occupied 26.2% and 8.1%, respectively. The most common subtype of lymphoma was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (35.0%), followed by extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTCL) (12.9%) and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (7.8%). Mixed cellularity (34.0%) was the most common subtype of HL. The especially high proportion of ENKTCL was the most outstanding feature of our study in comparison to previous reports. The mean age of all lymphoid neoplasms cases was 51years and most subtypes showed male predominance, with an average male-female ratio of 1.6. Extranodal lymphomas took up about 60% of all cases and gastrointestinal tract was the most frequently involved site. In conclusion, the distribution of lymphoid neoplasms of Northwest China showed some features similar to previous reports of China and other countries, but some subtypes presented distinct features."
3,Stage IV Gastro-Entero-Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: A Risk Score to Predict Clinical Outcome.,"Several risk factors predict clinical outcome in gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs); however, the impact of their combination has not been investigated so far.A retrospective analysis of stage IV GEP-NENs was performed. Multivariate analysis for progression of disease (PD) was performed by Cox proportional hazards method to obtain a risk score. Area under the curve obtained by receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the score performance. Progression-free survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.Two hundred eighty-three stage IV GEP-NENs were evaluated, including 93 grade 1 neuroendocrine tumors (32.9%), 153 grade 2 neuroendocrine tumors (54%), and 37 grade 3 neuroendocrine carcinomas (13.1%). Independent risk factors for PD were Ki67, proportion of metastatic liver involvement, and presence of extra-abdominal metastases. The risk score was calculated as follows: (0.025 ?? Ki67)?€?+?€?[(0 if no liver metastases or liver involvement <25%) OR (0.405 if liver involvement 25%-50%) OR (0.462 if liver involvement >50%)]?€?+?€?[(0 if no extra-abdominal metastases) OR (0.528 if extra-abdominal metastases present)]. The risk score accuracy to predict PD was superior compared with the G grading system (area under the curve: 0.705 and 0.622, respectively). Three subgroups of patients with low, intermediate, and high risk of PD according to risk score were identified, median progression-free survival being 26 months, 19 months, and 12 months, respectively.In stage IV GEP-NENs, a risk score able to predict PD was obtained by combining Ki67, proportion of metastatic liver involvement, and presence of extra-abdominal metastases. The score may help to discriminate patients with different progression risk level to plan tailored therapeutic approaches and follow-up programs. <b>

3,Somatostatin receptor expression related to TP53 and RB1 alterations in pancreatic and extrapancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms with a Ki67-index above 20.,"Somatostatin receptor 2A expression is a feature of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms and is important for their diagnosis and therapy. Little is known about somatostatin receptor 2A expression in poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms in relation to TP53 and RB1 status and how these features may contribute to the separation of well from poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms with a proliferation index above 20%. This study investigates the expression of somatostatin receptors, p53 and Rb1, and TP53 alterations in pancreatic and extrapancreatic well and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (Ki67-index >20%). Thirty-seven poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms of pancreatic (n=12) and extrapancreatic origin (n=25) as well as 10 well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms of the pancreas (n=9) and rectum (n=1) with a Ki67-index >20% were immunostained for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, Ki67, CD56, p53, Rb1, ATRX, DAXX, progesterone receptor, somatostatin receptor 2A, somatostatin receptor 5, and cytokeratin 20, and sequenced for TP53, exons 5-9. Somatostatin receptor 2A was positive in 6/37 of poorly differentiated and in 8/10 of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms. One well-differentiated and two poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms expressed somatostatin receptor 5. Abnormal nuclear p53 and Rb1 staining was found in 29/37 and 22/37 poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms, respectively, whereas all well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms showed normal p53 and Rb1 expression. TP53 gene alterations were restricted to poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (24/34) and correlated well with p53 expression. All cases were progesterone receptor negative. Somatostatin receptor 2A expression is not limited to well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms but also occurs in 16% of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms from various sites. Most poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms are characterized by TP53 alterations and Rb1 loss, usually in the absence of somatostatin receptor 2A expression. In the pancreas, these criteria contribute to separate well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms with a Ki67-index above 20% from poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms."
3,Impact of the early detection of esophageal neoplasms in hypopharyngeal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.,"We examined the risk factors and prognostic factors for synchronous esophageal neoplasia (SEN) by comparing the characteristics of hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) patients with and without SEN.We examined 183 patients who were treated with definitive radiotherapy for HPC. Lugol chromoendoscopy screening of the esophagus was performed in all patients before chemoradiotherapy.Thirty-six patients had SEN, 49 patients died of HPC and two died of esophageal cancer. The patients with SEN exhibited significantly higher alcohol consumption than those without SEN (P?€?=?€?0.018). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of the 36 patients with SEN was lower than that of the other patients (36.2% vs 63.4%, P?€?=?€?0.006). The SEN patients exhibited significantly shorter HPC cause-specific survival than the other patients (P?€?=?€?0.039). Both the OS (P?€?=?€?0.005) and the HPC cause-specific survival (P?€?=?€?0.026) of the patients with SEN were significantly shorter than those of the patients without SEN in multivariate analysis. Category 4/T1 stage esophageal cancer was treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), endoscopic treatment or chemotherapy. The 5-year survival rates for esophageal cancer recurrence for CCRT, endoscopic treatment and chemotherapy were 71.5, 43.7 and 0%, respectively. The median (range) survival time (months) of CCRT, endoscopic treatment and chemotherapy was 22.7 (7.5-90.6), 46.44 (17.3-136.7) and 7.98 (3.72-22.8), respectively.Advanced HPC patients with SEN might have a poorer prognosis than those without SEN even when the esophageal cancer is detected early and managed appropriately."
3,Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the characterization of testicular germ cell neoplasms: Effect of ROI methods on apparent diffusion coefficient values and interobserver variability.,"To evaluate the difference in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements at diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging of differently shaped regions-of-interest (ROIs) in testicular germ cell neoplasms (TGCNS), the diagnostic ability of differently shaped ROIs in differentiating seminomas from nonseminomatous germ cell neoplasms (NSGCNs) and the interobserver variability.Thirty-three TGCNs were retrospectively evaluated. Patients underwent MR examinations, including DWI on a 1.5-T MR system. Two observers measured mean tumor ADCs using four distinct ROI methods: round, square, freehand and multiple small, round ROIs. The interclass correlation coefficient was analyzed to assess interobserver variability. Statistical analysis was used to compare mean ADC measurements among observers, methods and histologic types.All ROI methods showed excellent interobserver agreement, with excellent correlation (P<0.001). Multiple, small ROIs provided the lower mean ADC in TGCNs. Seminomas had lower mean ADC compared to NSGCNs for each ROI method (P<0.001). Round ROI proved the most accurate method in characterizing TGCNS.Interobserver variability in ADC measurement is excellent, irrespective of the ROI shape. Multiple, small round ROIs and round ROI proved the more accurate methods for ADC measurement in the characterization of TGCNs and in the differentiation between seminomas and NSGCNs, respectively."
3,"The Evolving Role of Pathology in New Developments, Classification, Terminology, and Diagnosis of Pancreatobiliary Neoplasms.","Pancreatobiliary tract lesions are increasingly being discovered because of more sensitive imaging modalities. Magnetic resonance imaging has identified incidental pancreatic cysts in 13.5% of patients of progressively increasing age. Pancreatobiliary tissue is more accessible through endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy procedures, and is now an integral part of pathologists' routine practice. Accordingly, several new tumor categories have been recently recognized, including intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm, a new addition to tumoral intraepithelial neoplasms. Other entities have been reclassified, including the recent transition to 2-tiered grading of preinvasive neoplasms, as well as new perspectives on the distinctive biologic behavior of oncocytic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) compared with other IPMN subtypes. This has led to proposals for revised staging of virtually every segment of the pancreatobiliary tree, with theranostic markers becoming an integral part of workup. Ki-67 is now an integral part of the classification of neuroendocrine tumors, with new definitions of ""high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma."" Although bile duct brushings have opened new avenues for diagnosis, their sensitivity remains low and often requires concomitant fluorescent in situ hybridization to better define ambiguous cases. Various molecular pathways have been elucidated for pancreatic cysts, including KRAS for ductal neoplasia, GNAS for intestinal IPMNs, RNF3 for mucinous cysts, and VHL for serous cystic neoplasms, all key players in diagnostic workup. Integration of these updates into our understanding of pancreatobiliary disease requires active engagement of pathologists for appropriate specimen triage, judicious interpretation of results, and incorporation into reporting and staging. They also provide exciting opportunities for targeted therapy."
3,[Second neoplasms after percutaneous radiotherapy].,"Radiation therapy represents an alternative treatment to radical prostatectomy in the management of clinically localized prostate cancer. Radiation-induced second neoplasms are defined by a??latency period of at least 5??years, location within the field of radiation therapy, and a??histology which differs from the primary tumor. Based on the data in the literature, there is a??consistently increased risk of bladder cancer (HR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.55-1.80), rectal cancer (HR: 1.79, 95% CI 1.34-2.38), and colorectal cancer (HR: 1.79, 95% CI 1.34-23.8) following percutaneous radiation therapy. Following brachytherapy only an increased for the development of bladder cancer (HR: 2.14, 95% CI 1.03-3.94) has been observed. The incidence of second neoplasms increases significantly and continuously with the posttreatment time interval. Although bladder cancers following RT of the prostate are usually more locally advanced and of high grade, no negative impact in terms of overall survival and cancer-specific survival has been observed. Symptoms or findings of microhematuria need to be examined thoroughly after radiation therapy to identify bladder cancer quite early."
3,Neuroendocrine neoplasms of rectum: A management update.,"The estimated annual incidence of R-NENs is 1.04 per 100,000 persons although the real incidence may be underestimated, as not all R-NEN are systematically reported in registers. Also the prevalence has increased substantially, reflecting the rising incidence and indolent nature of R-NENs, showing the highest prevalence increase among all site of origin of NENs. The size of the tumor reveals the behavior of R-NENs where the risk for metastatic spread increases for lesions?€?>?€?10?€?mm. Applying the WHO 2010 grading system to whole NENs originating in the gastroenteropancreatic system, R-NENs are classified as Well-Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors (WD-NET), which contain NET G1 and NET G2, and Poorly-Differentiated Carcinomas (PD-NEC) enclosing only G3 neoplasms for which the term carcinoma is applied. The treatment is endoscopic resection in most cases: conventional polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for smaller lesions or endoscopic submucosal resection with a ligation device (ESMR-L), cap-assisted EMR (EMR-C) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). However it is important to know when the endoscopic treatment is not enough, and surgical treatment is indicated, or when the latter could be unnecessary. For PD-NECs, it has recently been demonstrated that chemoradiotherapy is associated with a similar long-term survival to that obtained with surgery. As well, new targeted-agents chemotherapy may be indicated for metastatic WD-NETs."
3,[Advances of circulating biomarkers in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms].,"Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplam (GEP-NEN) is a rare group of tumors with its incidence rising significantly in recent decades. Because of the late presentation of the disease and limitations in conventional biomarkers, about 50% of GEP-NEN patients manifests advanced disease when diagnosed. Therefore, it is vital to identify circulating biomarkers which can not only be used for early diagnosis but also accurately evaluating the biological behavior of GEP-NEN. This review summarizes the advances of circulating biomarkers in diagnosing and evaluating efficacy of treatment in GEP-NEN. Well-known circulating biomarkers include chromogranin A (CgA), pancreastatin (PST), chromogranin B (CgB), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and pancreatic peptide(PP). Novel biomarkers including circulating tumor cell(CTC), microRNA and NETest are promising biomarkers with potential clinical benefit, but further researches are needed before their clinical applications."
3,Topics in histopathology of sweat gland and sebaceous neoplasms.,"This article reviews several topics regarding sweat gland and sebaceous neoplasms. First, the clinicopathological characteristics of poroid neoplasms are summarized. It was recently reported that one-fourth of poroid neoplasms are composite tumors and one-fourth are apocrine type lesions. Recent progress in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of sweat gland neoplasms is also reviewed. CD117 can help to distinguish sweat gland or sebaceous tumors from other non-Merkel cell epithelial tumors of the skin. For immunohistochemical differential diagnosis between sweat gland carcinoma (SGC) other than primary cutanesous apocrine carcinoma and skin metastasis of breast carcinoma (SMBC), a panel of antibodies may be useful, including p63 (SGC<sup>+</sup> , SMBC<sup>-</sup> ), CK5/6 (SGC<sup>+</sup> , SMBC<sup>-</sup> ), podoplanin (SGC<sup>+</sup> , SMBC<sup>-</sup> ) and mammaglobin (SGC<sup>-</sup> , SMBC<sup>+</sup> ). Comparison of antibodies used for immunohistochemical diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma (SC) suggests that adipophilin has the highest sensitivity and specificity. Some authors have found that immunostaining for survivin, androgen receptor and ZEB2/SIP1 has prognostic value for ocular SC, but not extraocular SC. In situ SC is rare, especially extraocular SC, but there have been several recent reports that actinic keratosis and Bowen's disease are the source of invasive SC. Finally, based on recent reports, classification of sebaceous neoplasms into three categories is proposed, which are sebaceoma (a benign neoplasm with well-defined architecture and no atypia), borderline sebaceous neoplasm (low-grade SC; an intermediate tumor with well-defined architecture and nuclear atypia) and SC (a malignant tumor with invasive growth and evident nuclear atypia)."
3,Case of parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma: Expanding the spectrum of von Hippel-Lindau-related neoplasms.,"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-related tumors occurring outside the spectrum of VHL-defining tumors are rare, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) in the setting of VHL disease has not been described.We describe a patient with confirmed VHL mutation who presented with a parotid mass and a history of 2 central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas and 1 pheochromocytoma. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the mass suggested a benign Warthin tumor. The mass was resected and final pathology revealed a low-grade MEC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the MECT1/MAML2 fusion gene frequently associated with MEC was performed and was negative. Molecular testing of tumor cells displayed a likely ""second hit"" VHL gene mutation.There is a possible broader role of VHL mutations in tumorigenesis beyond the development of classically described VHL-defining neoplasms. Our case also demonstrates the importance of always considering the possibility of a parotid malignancy in patients with VHL despite a benign FNA. ?? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3,Enucleation: A treatment alternative for branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.,"Small, asymptomatic, branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas are often kept under surveillance despite their malignant potential. The management of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm is controversial with regard to indications and extent of any operative intervention. The present study aimed to evaluate enucleation as an alternative operative approach for branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms to exclude and prevent malignancy.For branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of <30??mm in diameter and an acceptable distance from the main pancreatic duct, enucleation was considered as the operative approach of choice. All patients scheduled for enucleation of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm on the basis of these features between January 2004 and September 2014 were analyzed. Among these, patients with successful enucleation were compared with those who were scheduled for enucleation but converted intraoperatively to pancreatic resection (intention-to-treat analysis). End points were hospital morbidity and mortality as well as histopathology and functional outcome at a mean follow-up of 32??months.In the study, 115 patients with presumed branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and the intention to perform pancreatic enucleation were included; 87 enucleations were performed in 74 patients. In 41 patients, enucleation was converted to a pancreatic resection (procedure-specific success rate 64%); indications for conversion included location or size (46%), presence of multicystic lesions (39%), or involvement of the main pancreatic duct (15%). Of the 74 patients with enucleation, 64 branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms revealed low- (85%), 11% moderate dysplasia-, and 4% high-grade dysplasia on histology. Among converted resections, 6 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms revealed high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma (15%). Intention-to-treat analysis with patients converted to pancreatic resection showed that enucleations resulted in less blood loss (100 vs 400??mL) and a shorter operation time (146 vs 255??minutes; P??<??.001 each). Postoperative morbidity including postoperative pancreatic fistula was similar in both groups. No mortality occurred after enucleation; after formal resection, 1 patient died due to multiorgan failure. Both hospital stay (10 vs 14??days) and rates of postoperative endocrine and exocrine dysfunction rates were less after enucleation (P??<??.02 each). Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm-specific recurrence rates (3% vs 6%) were similar in both groups.Enucleation is a safe procedure that can be performed successfully in a high proportion of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and should be considered instead of standard resections as an important function-preserving alternative. Limitations may occur due to malignancy, size, localization, multilocularity, or main-duct involvement requiring conversion to a formal, anatomic resection. Beside the advantages in the short-term course, functional outcome seems to be superior after enucleation, and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm-specific recurrence rates are not increased compared with standard resections, at least at a mean follow-up of 32??months."
3,NCCN Debuts New Guidelines for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.,"For the first time, NCCN has published guidelines specifically geared toward treating myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The first set of guidelines was developed for myelofibrosis (MF), and was presented at the NCCN 22nd Annual Conference. Future guidelines will be issued for polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytopenia, and atypical MPNs. Patients with MF can have an unpredictable course, one that is largely dependent on the presence of certain molecular alterations. Models are currently emerging that take into account molecular factors. Only one drug is currently approved for MF, the oral <i>JAK1/2</i> inhibitor ruxolitinib, which has been shown to significantly reduce splenomegaly and improve symptoms."
2,Occurrence of enteric parasitic infections among HIV-infected individuals and its relation to CD4 T-cell counts with a special emphasis on coccidian parasites at a tertiary care centre in South India.,"Diarrhoea is one of the major complications occurring in over 90% of HIV-infected individuals in developing countries. Coccidian group of parasites, being opportunistic pathogens, have been implicated as the most common causative agents of diarrhoea among HIV-infected population.The aim was to study the magnitude of parasitic diarrhoea with special context to coccidian parasitic infections in HIV-infected individuals and their association with the patient's immunological status measured by CD4 T-cell counts.This investigation was performed between January 2002 and December 2014 at a tertiary HIV care centre in Chennai, South India.Stool samples were collected and microscopically observed for parasites using direct, formal-ether-concentrated wet mounts and modified acid-fast staining for coccidian parasites. CD4 T-cell counts were done by FACScount.All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software, version 5.0, andP < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Coccidian parasitic infection accounted for about 23.4% of parasitic infections, and of these, Cystoisospora belli was observed to be the most common cause of diarrhoea (88.8%), followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (9.9%) and Cyclospora spp. (1.3%). Trend analysis of coccidian aetiology during the study period revealed a significant rise in the positivity of C. belli and Cryptosporidium spp. (P = 0.001). Among the HIV patients with CD4+ T-cell counts <200 cells/??L, Cryptosporidium infection was most common (90%), followed by infection with C. belli(61.4%).Coccidian parasites continue to be the most common aetiological agent of diarrhoea among patients with HIV. The increasing trend of positivity of both cystoisosporiasis and cryptosporidiosis over the study period and the high positivity of cryptosporidiosis in patients with lower CD4+ T-cell counts are issues of serious concern. The findings call for the need for the early diagnosis of coccidian parasites and appropriate intervention among HIV-infected patients."
2,A preface on advances in diagnostics for infectious and parasitic diseases: detecting parasites of medical and veterinary importance.,"There are many reasons why detection of parasites of medical and veterinary importance is vital and where novel diagnostic and surveillance tools are required. From a medical perspective alone, these originate from a desire for better clinical management and rational use of medications. Diagnosis can be at the individual-level, at close to patient settings in testing a clinical suspicion or at the community-level, perhaps in front of a computer screen, in classification of endemic areas and devising appropriate control interventions. Thus diagnostics for parasitic diseases has a broad remit as parasites are not only tied with their definitive hosts but also in some cases with their vectors/intermediate hosts. Application of current diagnostic tools and decision algorithms in sustaining control programmes, or in elimination settings, can be problematic and even ill-fitting. For example in resource-limited settings, are current diagnostic tools sufficiently robust for operational use at scale or are they confounded by on-the-ground realities; are the diagnostic algorithms underlying public health interventions always understood and well-received within communities which are targeted for control? Within this Special Issue (SI) covering a variety of diseases and diagnostic settings some answers are forthcoming. An important theme, however, throughout the SI is to acknowledge that cross-talk and continuous feedback between development and application of diagnostic tests is crucial if they are to be used effectively and appropriately."
2,Practical parasitology courses and infection with intestinal parasites in students.,"Students who are working in research or educational laboratories of parasitology, as well as health care workers providing care for patients, are at the risk of becoming infected with parasites through accidental exposure. The main purpose of this study was to identify potential positive cases of intestinal parasitic infections among students who took practical parasitology courses compared with students who did not take any practical parasitology courses in Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran, in 2013-2014. A total of 310 subjects from various majors were invited to voluntarily participate in the study. Various demographic data were collected using questionnaires. Three stool samples were collected from each individual on alternate days. Saline wet mounts (SWM), formalin-ether sedimentation test (FEST), Sheather floatation test (SHFT) and trichrome and modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods were used to diagnose the presence of intestinal parasites. The prevalence rate of intestinal parasites (IPs) among the students was 11.93%. There was a significant difference between majors in the infection with IPs (P<0.05). The most frequently observed IPs were Blastocystis hominis (4.51%) and Giardia intestinalis (3.54%). The results of this study showed that the transmission of pathogenic parasites in the educational course of practical parasitology could occur and must be taken into careful consideration. "
2,Molecular diagnosis in clinical parasitology: when and why?,"Microscopic detection and morphological identification of parasites from clinical specimens are the gold standards for the laboratory diagnosis of parasitic infections. The limitations of such diagnostic assays include insufficient sensitivity and operator dependence. Immunoassays for parasitic antigens are not available for most parasitic infections and have not significantly improved the sensitivity of laboratory detection. Advances in molecular detection by nucleic acid amplification may improve the detection in asymptomatic infections with low parasitic burden. Rapidly accumulating genomic data on parasites allow the design of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers directed towards multi-copy gene targets, such as the ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, which further improve the sensitivity. Parasitic cell or its free circulating parasitic DNA can be shed from parasites into blood and excreta which may allow its detection without the whole parasite being present within the portion of clinical sample used for DNA extraction. Multiplex nucleic acid amplification technology allows the simultaneous detection of many parasitic species within a single clinical specimen. In addition to improved sensitivity, nucleic acid amplification with sequencing can help to differentiate different parasitic species at different stages with similar morphology, detect and speciate parasites from fixed histopathological sections and identify anti-parasitic drug resistance. The use of consensus primer and PCR sequencing may even help to identify novel parasitic species. The key limitation of molecular detection is the technological expertise and expense which are usually lacking in the field setting at highly endemic areas. However, such tests can be useful for screening important parasitic infections in asymptomatic patients, donors or recipients coming from endemic areas in the settings of transfusion service or tertiary institutions with transplantation service. Such tests can also be used for monitoring these recipients or highly immunosuppressed patients, so that early preemptive treatment can be given for reactivated parasitic infections while the parasitic burden is still low. "
2,One Health: parasites and beyond.,"The field of parasitism is broad, encompassing relationships between organisms where one benefits at the expense of another. Traditionally the discipline focuses on eukaryotes, with the study of bacteria and viruses complementary but distinct. Nonetheless, parasites vary in size and complexity from single celled protozoa, to enormous plants like those in the genus Rafflesia. Lifecycles range from obligate intracellular to extensive exoparasitism. Examples of parasites include high-profile medical and zoonotic pathogens such as Plasmodium, veterinary pathogens of wild and captive animals and many of the agents which cause neglected tropical diseases, stretching to parasites which infect plants and other parasites (e.g. Kikuchi et al. 2011; Hotez et al. 2014; Blake et al. 2015; Hemingway, 2015; Meekums et al. 2015; Sandlund et al. 2015). The breadth of parasitology has been matched by the variety of ways in which parasites are studied, drawing upon biological, chemical, molecular, epidemiological and other expertise. Despite such breadth bridging between disciplines has commonly been problematic, regardless of extensive encouragement from government agencies, peer audiences and funding bodies promoting multidisciplinary research. Now, progress in understanding and collaboration can benefit from establishment of the One Health concept (Zinsstag et al. 2012; Stark et al. 2015). One Health draws upon biological, environmental, medical, veterinary and social science disciplines in order to improve human, animal and environmental health, although it remains tantalizingly difficult to engage many relevant parties. For infectious diseases traditional divides have been exacerbated as the importance of wildlife reservoirs, climate change, food production systems and socio-economic diversity have been recognized but often not addressed in a multidisciplinary manner. In response the 2015 Autumn Symposium organized by the British Society for Parasitology (BSP; https://www.bsp.uk.net/home/) was focused on One Health, running under the title 'One Health: parasites and beyond?€?'. The meeting, held at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in Camden, London from September 14th to 15th, drew upon a blend of specialist parasitology reinforced with additional complementary expertise. Scientists, advocates, policy makers and industry representatives were invited to present at the meeting, promoting and developing One Health understanding with relevance to parasitology. The decision to widen the scope of the meeting to non-parasitological, but informative topics, is reflected in the diversity of the articles included in this special issue. A key feature of the meeting was encouragement of early career scientists, with more than 35% of the delegates registered as students and 25 posters."
2,History of Medical Parasitology and Parasitic Infections in Iran.,"Parasites and parasitic diseases have been prevalent in Iran according to Iranian ancient scholars and physicians' inscriptions dating back to 865-1496. Some protozoan diseases such as malaria and cutaneous leishmaniasis have been introduced by clinical manifestations and helminthic infections by size and morphology of the worms. Scientific studies of Parasitology started in Iran from 1833, first by foreign physicians and continued from 1909 by Iranian researchers. The pioneer medical parasitologists of Iran were Dr N. Ansari and Dr. Sh. Mofidi who established the Department of Medical Parasitology in the School of Medicine, University of Tehran, 1939. Afterward, a considerable number of researchers and professors of parasitology have been active in training and research works in the fields of medical parasitology throughout the entire nation. At present, some significant parasitic diseases such as bilharsiasis and dracunculiasis are more or less eradicated and malaria is in the elimination phase. The prevalence of most helminthic infections has considerably decreased. Most of the departments of medical Parasitology in Iran are active in training MD, MSPH and PhD students. The Iranian Society of Parasitology established in 1994 is active with many eligible members and its creditable publication, the Iranian Journal of Parasitology, published seasonally since 2006. From 1833, when the scientific studies of Parasitology have started in Iran up to 2013, many researchers have been done on various fields of medical Parasitology and parasitic diseases in Iran and 2517 papers in English and 1890 papers in Persian have been published in national and international scientific journals. In addition, more than 420 books related in the field of medical parasitology field have been published in Persian language. "
2,"Parasitic infections detected by FLOTAC in zoo mammals from Warsaw, Poland.","The aim of this study was to estimate the occurrence of intestinal parasites in groups of mammals kept in the Warsaw zoological garden (Poland). 71 pools of fecal samples were analyzed using the FLOTAC techniques. 48% of animals were positive and 47% of positivities showed multiple infections. Toxocara cati (71.4%) was found in felines; marsupials were infected with Coccidia (90%). Giardia spp. (24.0%), Blastocystis spp. (12.3%), Iodamoeba spp. (10.0%), Enterobius vermicularis (6.0%) and Entamoeba coli (3.3%) were found in primates. Gastrointestinal strongyles (60.5%) were prevalent in ruminants which resulted positive also to Coccidia (Eimeria spp. = 50.0%), Trichuris spp. (25.0%) and Nematodirus (14.0%). Strongyles (34.0%) were the most frequent parasites in monogastric herbivores, followed by Parascaris equorum (17.0%). None of the animals showed any symptom associated with gastrointestinal parasitic infections. According to our results the need to prevent, diagnose, control, and treat intestinal parasitism trough specific control programs is mandatory for animal welfare in order to limit the spread of parasitic infections in animals and humans. "
2,[Concordance between the zinc sulphate flotation and centrifugal sedimentation methods for the diagnosis of intestinal parasites].,"The diagnosis of intestinal parasitic infections depends on the parasite load, the specific gravity density of the parasite eggs, oocysts or cysts, and the density and viscosity of flotation or sedimentation medium where faeces are processed.To evaluate the concordance between zinc sulphate flotation and centrifugal sedimentation in the recovery of parasites in faecal samples of children.Faecal samples of 330 children from day care centers were evaluated by zinc sulphate flotation and centrifugal sedimentation techniques. The frequencies of detection of parasites by each method were determined and the agreement between the diagnostic techniques was evaluated using the kappa index, with 95% confidence intervals.The faecal flotation in zinc sulphate diagnosed significantly more cases of Trichuris trichiura infection when compared to centrifugal sedimentation (39/330; 11.8% vs. 13/330; 3.9%, p<0.001), with low diagnostic concordance between methods (kappa=0.264; 95% CI: 0.102-0.427). Moreover, all positive samples for Enterobius vermicularis eggs (n=5) and Strongyloides stercoralis larvae (n=3) were diagnosed only by zinc sulphate. No statistical differences were observed between methods for protozoa identification.The results showed that centrifugal flotation in zinc sulphate solution was significantly more likely to detect light helminths eggs such as those of T. trichiura and E. vermicularis in faeces than the centrifugal sedimentation process."
2,"Gastrointestinal parasites of canids, a latent risk to human health in Tunisia.","Although data on the parasite environmental contamination are crucial to implement strategies for control and treatment, information about zoonotic helminths is very limited in Tunisia. Contamination of areas with canid faeces harboring infective parasite elements represents a relevant health-risk impact for humans. The aim of this study was to assess the environmental contamination with eggs and oocysts of gastrointestinal parasites of dogs and wild canids in Tunisia with special attention to those that can be transmitted to humans.One thousand two hundred and seventy faecal samples from stray dogs and 104 from wild canids (red foxes and golden jackals) were collected from different geographical regions throughout Tunisia. The helminth eggs and protozoan oocysts were concentrated by sucrose flotation and identified by microscopic examination. The most frequently observed parasites in dog samples were Toxocara spp. (27.2%), E. granulosus (25.8%), and Coccidia (13.1%). For wild canid faeces, the most commonly encountered parasites were Toxocara spp. (16.3%) followed by Capillaria spp. (9.6%). The parasite contamination of dog faeces varied significantly from one region to another in function of the climate.To our knowledge, the study highlights for the first time in Tunisia a serious environmental contamination by numerous parasitic stages infective to humans. Efforts should be made to increase the awareness of the contamination risk of such parasites in the environment and implement a targeted educational program."
2,Intestinal parasites from the 2nd-5th century AD latrine in the Roman Baths at Sagalassos (Turkey).,"The aim of this research was to determine the species of intestinal parasite present in a Roman Imperial period population in Asia Minor, and to use this information to improve our understanding of health in the eastern Mediterranean region in Roman times. We analyzed five samples from the latrines of the Roman bath complex at Sagalassos, Turkey. Fecal biomarker analysis using 5??-stanols has indicated the feces were of human origin. The eggs of roundworm (Ascaris) were identified in all five samples using microscopy, and the cysts of the protozoan Giardia duodenalis (which causes dysentery) were identified multiple times in one sample using ELISA. The positive G. duodenalis result at Sagalassos is particularly important as it represents the earliest reliable evidence for this parasite in the Old World (i.e. outside the Americas). As both these species of parasite are spread through the contamination of food and water by fecal material, their presence implies that Roman sanitation technologies such as latrines and public baths did not break the cycle of reinfection in this population. We then discuss the evidence for roundworm in the writings of the Roman physician Galen, who came from Pergamon, another town in western Asia Minor."
2,"""Not a very nice subject."" Changing views of parasites and parasitology in the twentieth century.","The man in-the-street who frequently asks the question ""Why am I here?"" finds even more difficulty with the question ""Why are parasites here?"" The public's distaste for parasites (and by implication, for parasitologists!) is therefore understandable, as maybe was the feeling of early 20th century biologists that parasites were a puzzle because they did not conform to the then widely held association between evolution and progress, let alone the reason why a benevolent Creator should have created them. In mid-century, the writer, contemplating a career in parasitology was taken aback when he found that extolled contemporary biologists disdained parasites or thought little of parasitology as an intellectual subject. These attitudes reflected a lack of appreciation of the important role of parasites in generating evolutionary novelty and speciation, also unawareness of the value of parasite life-cycle studies for formulating questions of wider significance in biology, deficiencies which were gratifyingly beginning to be remedied in the latter half of the century."
2,Recovering parasites from mummies and coprolites: an epidemiological approach.,"In the field of archaeological parasitology, researchers have long documented the distribution of parasites in archaeological time and space through the analysis of coprolites and human remains. This area of research defined the origin and migration of parasites through presence/absence studies. By the end of the 20th century, the field of pathoecology had emerged as researchers developed an interest in the ancient ecology of parasite transmission. Supporting studies were conducted to establish the relationships between parasites and humans, including cultural, subsistence, and ecological reconstructions. Parasite prevalence data were collected to infer the impact of parasitism on human health. In the last few decades, a paleoepidemiological approach has emerged with a focus on applying statistical techniques for quantification. The application of egg per gram (EPG) quantification methods provide data about parasites' prevalence in ancient populations and also identify the pathological potential that parasitism presented in different time periods and geographic places. Herein, we compare the methods used in several laboratories for reporting parasite prevalence and EPG quantification. We present newer quantification methods to explore patterns of parasite overdispersion among ancient people. These new methods will be able to produce more realistic measures of parasite infections among people of the past. These measures allow researchers to compare epidemiological patterns in both ancient and modern populations."
2,Parasitic infections on the shore of Lake Victoria (East Africa) detected by Mini-FLOTAC and standard techniques.,"Helminths and protozoa infections pose a great burden especially in developing countries, due to morbidity caused by both acute and chronic infection. The aim of our survey was to analyze the intestinal parasitic burden in communities from Mwanza region, Tanzania.Subjects (n=251) from four villages on the South of Lake Victoria have been analyzed for intestinal parasites with direct smear (DS), formol-ether concentration method (FECM) and the newly developed Mini-FLOTAC technique; urinary schistosomiasis was also assessed in a subsample (n=151); symptoms were registered and correlation between clinic and infections was calculated by chi-squared test and logistical regression.Out of the subjects screened for intestinal and for urinary parasites, 87% (218/251) were found positive for any infection, 69% (174/251) carried a helminthic and 67% (167/251) a protozoan infection, almost half of them had a double or triple infection. The most common helminths were hookworms, followed by Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium. Among protozoa, the most common was Entamoeba coli followed by Entamoeba histolytica/dispar and Giardia intestinalis. Mini-FLOTAC detected a number of helminth infections (61.7%) higher than FECM (38.6%) and DS (17.9%). Some positive associations with abdominal symptoms were found and previous treatment was negatively correlated with infection.Despite the limited size of the examined population the current study indicates a high prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection in Bukumbi area, Tanzania, and Mini-FLOTAC showed to be a promising diagnostic tool for helminth infections. This high parasitic burden calls for starting a regular deworming programme and other preventive interventions in schools and in the community."
2,A synoptic overview of golden jackal parasites reveals high diversity of species.,"The golden jackal (Canis aureus) is a species under significant and fast geographic expansion. Various parasites are known from golden jackals across their geographic range, and certain groups can be spread during their expansion, increasing the risk of cross-infection with other carnivores or even humans. The current list of the golden jackal parasites includes 194 species and was compiled on the basis of an extensive literature search published from historical times until April 2017, and is shown herein in synoptic tables followed by critical comments of the various findings. This large variety of parasites is related to the extensive geographic range, territorial mobility and a very unselective diet. The vast majority of these parasites are shared with domestic dogs or cats. The zoonotic potential is the most important aspect of species reported in the golden jackal, some of them, such as Echinococcus spp., hookworms, Toxocara spp., or Trichinella spp., having a great public health impact. Our review brings overwhelming evidence on the importance of Canis aureus as a??wild reservoir of human and animal parasites."
2,"MALDI-TOF MS Profiling-Advances in Species Identification of Pests, Parasites, and Vectors.","Invertebrate pests and parasites of humans, animals, and plants continue to cause serious diseases and remain as a high treat to agricultural productivity and storage. The rapid and accurate species identification of the pests and parasites are needed for understanding epidemiology, monitoring outbreaks, and designing control measures. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling has emerged as a rapid, cost effective, and high throughput technique of microbial species identification in modern diagnostic laboratories. The development of soft ionization techniques and the release of commercial pattern matching software platforms has resulted in the exponential growth of applications in higher organisms including parasitology. The present review discusses the proof-of-principle experiments and various methods of MALDI MS profiling in rapid species identification of both laboratory and field isolates of pests, parasites and vectors."
2,"Parasites in stray dogs from Italy: prevalence, risk factors and management concerns.","Parasites are among the most common pathogens recorded in dogs. High prevalence rates are usually reported in stray and shelter dogs, as these animals are less likely to be tested and treated. In this study a survey was carried out on intestinal and lung parasites of stray dogs at the moment of the admission in a shelter in Central Italy. In the period June 2014-June 2015, 262 individual faecal samples were examined. Twelve parasitic taxa were detected. Helminths were more prevalent than protozoa (61.8% and 25.6%, respectively). Ancylostomatidae showed the higher prevalence (40.5%), followed by Giardia duodenalis (21.4%), Toxocara canis (20.6%) and Trichuris vulpis (17.6%). Angiostrongylus vasorum was the most prevalent lungworm (12.6%), Crenosoma vulpis being recorded just in one dog. G. duodenalis had a high prevalence, probably because of the diagnostic techniques adopted, actually the most sensitive available for its detection. Nevertheless, the zoonotic potential of this parasite in dogs appears reduced, as all the isolates were identified as C (24.0%) and D (76.0%) dog specific assemblages. Taeniidae constituted a high potential zoonotic risk, as from the eggs it is impossible to exclude they were Echinococcus granulosus, the most relevant zoonotic parasite in Europe. The present study underline the importance of stray dogs control, aimed at preventing or minimizing parasitic spread and zoonotic transmission."
2,Reestablishing rigor in archaeological parasitology.,"Archaeological parasitology originated in the mid-twentieth century with interdisciplinary teams of specialists directed by archaeologists. The goals of such studies were detailed analyses of dietary, medicinal, and environmental factors that shaped the patterns of infection. By the 1970s, a cadre of unique coprolite analysts was trained to analyze macroscopic and microscopic remains for integrated reconstructions of the cultural determinants of parasitism. During these first phases of research, diagnostic rigor was maintained by direct training of specialists in parasitology and archaeology sub-disciplines including archaeobotany and archaeopalynology. Near the end of the twentieth century, however, ""paleoparasitology"" was defined as a separate field focusing on defining parasite distribution through time and space. Ironically, this focus resulted in an increase in misdiagnosis, especially prominent after 2000. Paleoparasitology does not explicitly include other specialized studies in it research design. Thus, dietary, environmental and medicinal inferences have been neglected or lost as samples were destroyed solely for the purpose of parasitological analysis. Without ancillary archaeological studies, paleoparasitology runs the risk of separation from archaeological context, thereby reducing its value to the archaeologists who recover samples for analysis."
2,Past Intestinal Parasites.,"This chapter aims to provide some key points for researchers interested in the study of ancient gastrointestinal parasites. These few pages are dedicated to my colleague and friend, Prof. Adauto Ara??jo (1951-2015), who participated in the writing of this chapter. His huge efforts in paleoparasitology contributed to the development and promotion of the discipline during more than 30 years."
2,"Parasites as biological tags of marine, freshwater and anadromous fishes in North America from the Tropics to the Arctic.","Parasites have been considered as natural biological tags of marine fish populations in North America for almost 75 years. In the Northwest Atlantic, the most studied species include Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and the redfishes (Sebastes spp.). In the North Pacific, research has centred primarily on salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.). However, parasites have been applied as tags for numerous other pelagic and demersal species on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Relatively few studies have been undertaken in the Arctic, and these were designed to discriminate anadromous and resident salmonids (Salvelinus spp.). Although rarely applied in fresh waters, parasites have been used to delineate certain fish stocks within the Great Lakes-St Lawrence River basin. Anisakid nematodes and the copepod Sphyrion lumpi frequently prove useful indicators in the Northwest Atlantic, while myxozoan parasites prove very effective on the coast and open seas of the Pacific Ocean. Relative differences in the ability of parasites to discriminate between fish stocks on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts may be due to oceanographic and bathymetric differences between regions. Molecular techniques used to differentiate populations and species of parasites show promise in future applications in the field."
2,"Childhood intestinal parasitic infection and sanitation predictors in rural Dembiya, northwest Ethiopia.","Intestinal parasites are a common problem in the world. The greater proportion of infections is associated with poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). This study was conducted to assess intestinal parasites, WASH condition, and their association in rural Dembiya, northwest Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was employed. Two hundred twenty-five children aged 6-59??months were included. Mothers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire, and the living environment was observed using checklists. Kato-Katz technique was used to determine the intensity of parasitic infections. Escherichia coli (E. coli) was used as a biological indicator for drinking water quality. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify WASH predictors of parasites on the basis of adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and p?€?<?€?0.05.The prevalence of intestinal parasites was 25.8% (95% CI?€?=?€?20.3-32.0%). Ascaris lumbricoides (78%), hookworm (12%), Hymenolepis nana (7%), Enterobius vermicularis (5%), Schistosoma mansoni (3%), Giardia lamblia (3%), and Trichuris trichiuria (2%) were identified infections. Intestinal parasites were associated with poor child hand washing practice [AOR?€?=?€?3.86, 95% CI?€?=?€?1.53, 9.75], unprotected water sources [AOR?€?=?€?7.79, 95% CI?€?=?€?3.30, 18.40], access to water below 20??l/c/d [AOR?€?=?€?3.05, 95% CI?€?=?€?1.28, 7.23], poor food safety[AOR?€?=?€?4.33, 95% CI?€?=?€?1.62, 11.58], and poor sanitation [AOR?€?=?€?5.01, 95% CI?€?=?€?1.56, 16.16].A. lumbricoides, hookworm, H. nana, E. vermicularis, S. mansoni, G. lamblia, and T. trichiuria were identified. Child hand washing practice, service level of water supply, water sources, food safety, and sanitation were associated with intestinal parasites. WASH promotion is needed to prevent infections."
2,Occurrence of intestinal parasites among asylum seekers in Italy: A cross-sectional study.,"In recent years Europe has experienced a dramatic increase in migration flows. Nevertheless, limited data is available about the occurrence of neglected parasitic diseases among migrant population. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of intestinal and urinary parasites in newly arrived asylum seekers.A total of 364 newly arrived migrants hosted at the Asylum Seekers Centre of Castelnuovo di Porto (Italy) were screened during 8 months period for intestinal and urinary parasites. Each enrolled subject was interviewed using a standardized questionnaire, with focus on socio-demographical data and risk factors of parasitic infections.Stool analysis showed a prevalence of intestinal parasites of 20.6%. The travel route did not affect the prevalence of intestinal parasites (p?€?=?€?0.096), while a significant negative correlation was found between the length of travel and the prevalence of parasite infection (p?€?=?€?0.019). No statistically significant correlation between gastrointestinal symptoms and the presence of intestinal parasites was detected.The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis reported in asylum seekers does not necessarily reflect the prevalence of the parasitosis in the motherland. An anamnestic and syndromic approach may not be sufficient to highlight the problem of intestinal parasitic infestations in a screening setting."
2,"Enteric parasitic infection among HIV-infected patients visiting Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal.","Enteric parasitic infection among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients has been a significant health problem in developing countries like Nepal. This study was undertaken to access the burden of enteric parasites among HIV patients and its association with their immune status.A cross-sectional study, involving 112 HIV sero-positive patients was conducted in Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Public Health Research Laboratory, Kathmandu, Nepal from July 2011 to June 2012. The fecal samples were processed by direct-smear technique, in both normal saline solution and 1% iodine solution as well as modified acid fast staining (Kinyoun's method) after formalin ether concentration and Sheather's sucrose flotation for the identification of enteric parasites.Infection with one or more parasite was seen in 33.9% (n = 38) of the cases enrolled in the study, with the parasite prevalence rate of 41.1% (n = 46). Literacy (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 0.9-4.3) and CD4 T-cell count <200 (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.7) were found to be associated with enteric parasite infection. Similarly, CD4 T-cell count <200 was found to be associated with opportunistic parasitic infection (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.2-7.8). Among opportunistic parasites, Giardia duodenalis was the most common (28.3%, n = 13) one. Multi-parasitism was observed in six patients (15.8%).Enteric parasitic infections are common in HIV-infected people. The poor immune status as indicated by low CD4 T-cell count may account for higher risk of both opportunistic and non-opportunistic enteric parasitic infection."
2,Restriction enzyme digestion of host DNA enhances universal detection of parasitic pathogens in blood via targeted amplicon deep sequencing.,"Targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) of the 16S rRNA gene is commonly used to explore and characterize bacterial microbiomes. Meanwhile, attempts to apply TADS to the detection and characterization of entire parasitic communities have been hampered since conserved regions of many conserved parasite genes, such as the 18S rRNA gene, are also conserved in their eukaryotic hosts. As a result, targeted amplification of 18S rRNA from clinical samples using universal primers frequently results in competitive priming and preferential amplification of host DNA. Here, we describe a novel method that employs a single pair of universal primers to capture all blood-borne parasites while reducing host 18S rRNA template and enhancing the amplification of parasite 18S rRNA for TADS. This was achieved using restriction enzymes to digest the 18S rRNA gene at cut sites present only in the host sequence prior to PCR amplification.This method was validated against 16 species of blood-borne helminths and protozoa. Enzyme digestion prior to PCR enrichment and Illumina amplicon deep sequencing led to a substantial reduction in human reads and a corresponding 5- to 10-fold increase in parasite reads relative to undigested samples. This method allowed for discrimination of all common parasitic agents found in human blood, even in cases of multi-parasite infection, and markedly reduced the limit of detection in digested versus undigested samples.The results herein provide a novel methodology for the reduction of host DNA prior to TADS and establish the validity of a next-generation sequencing-based platform for universal parasite detection."
2,Parasitic zoonoses associated with dogs and cats: a survey of Portuguese pet owners' awareness and deworming practices.,"Parasitic diseases of companion animals comprise a group of globally distributed and rapidly spreading illnesses that are caused by a wide range of arthropods, helminths and protozoa. In addition to their veterinary importance, many of these parasites can also affect the human population, due to their zoonotic potential. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the knowledge of Portuguese pet owners regarding the zoonotic potential of parasites that dogs and cats can harbour, most common drugs, frequency of use and reasons for endo- and ectoparasite control.Seventy hundred and fifty multiple-choice questionnaires designed to obtain data knowledge about the meaning of zoonosis, knowledge about parasitic diseases and perception regarding their zoonotic potential, as well as the drugs, frequency and reason for deworming their animals were delivered to dog and/or cat owners from non-rural (i.e. urban or semi-urban) and rural parishes who attended veterinary medical centres from continental Portugal.A total of 536 (71.5??%) questionnaires were retrieved. Two hundred and ninety five (56.5??%) responders had heard of zoonosis/zoonoses, but only 184 (35.2??%) knew their meaning. Tick fever, mange, leishmaniosis and ascaridiosis/roundworms were the parasitic diseases from pets most frequently identified. The number of owners who recognized the different parasitoses, who stated to have heard about zoonoses and who were aware of the potential transmission of parasites from animals to humans was significantly higher in those with intermediate (i.e. ???9 and?€?????€?12??years of schooling) and/or higher academic degree (i.e. licentiate, master's and/or doctorate degrees). The combinations of febantel-pyrantel-praziquantel (23.5??%) and milbemycin-praziquantel (34.5??%) were the most widely endoparasitic drugs used in dogs and in cats, respectively. The most common ectoparasiticide used in dogs was a combination of imidacloprid-permethrin (33.4??%), while in cats it was imidacloprid (26.3??%) followed by fipronil (25.4??%). The most used treatment schedule against internal and external parasites in dogs and cats was an administration every three??months and the main reason to do it was as a prophylactic purpose.The majority of Portuguese owners that attended veterinarian clinics use endoparasiticides and ectoparasiticides in/on their pets as a prophylactic measure, although in many cases not in the correct schedule of treatment. In addition, most of them are not aware of the possible transmission of parasites from their dogs and cats to themselves, a fact which highlights the important role of veterinarians in the continuous implementation of effective control measures to reduce the risk of parasitic infections in both humans and companion animals."
2,"Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Parasitic Infections and Assessment of Deworming Program among Cattle and Buffaloes in Gampaha District, Sri Lanka.","Gastrointestinal (GI) parasitic infection is a serious issue in cattle management. The effects of GI parasites may vary with age, sex of cattle, nutritional condition, and severity of infection. Prevalence of GI parasites among cattle population in Gampaha District has not been studied and there is no published study available. A total of 45 farms rearing cattle were selected randomly in three areas, namely, Kelaniya, Ganemulla, and Welisara, under three Veterinary Surgeon Divisions (VSD) in Gampaha District (Mahara, Gampaha, and Welisara). Freshly voided cattle fecal samples were collected randomly from the selected farms during March 2017-December 2017. Out of 163 cattle and buffaloes examined, 13.39% (n=22) were positive for eggs of one or more species of GI parasites. The prevalence of parasitic infection was higher in buffaloes (31.25%, 5/16) as compared to that of cows (11.56%, 21/147), but the difference was not significant (<i>P</i> >0.05). Hookworms (<i>Bunostomum</i> spp.), whipworms (<i>Trichuris</i> spp.), digenetic trematodes (<i>Paramphistomum</i> spp.), cestodes (<i>Moniezia</i> spp.), and oocysts of protozoans (coccidians) were found during the study. The nontreated animals indicated the highest percentage of parasitic infections accounting for 46.67% (n= 14), followed by partially treated individuals (15.15%, n= 5). GI parasite prevalence in males was higher when compared to that of females, but the difference was nonsignificant (<i>P</i> >0.05). General Linear Modelling (GLM) revealed that the effect of treatment status was significantly associated with the prevalence of GI parasites. The calves and yearlings had the highest rate of GI parasitic infections. The highest infection rate was observed at Kelaniya, followed by Welisara. Future investigations are necessary to evaluate the economic impact of GI parasites in the study areas."
2,"Prevalence of zoonotic intestinal parasites in household and stray dogs in rural areas of Hamadan, Western Iran.","Zoonotic parasitic infections are a major global public and veterinary health problem and widespread among dogs. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of intestinal parasites in stray and household dogs in the rural areas of Hamadan district. During 2012, 1,500 fresh fecal samples from 243 household and 1,257 stray dogs were examined by using direct wet mount, simple zinc sulfate flotation, and Lugol's solution staining. Of 1,500 dogs, 20.4% were positive for intestinal parasites. Helminthes eggs were more frequently found in fecal samples than protozoan cysts or trophozoites (15.9% vs. 4.5%, respectively). Toxocara canis was the most frequently detected parasite, with a prevalence of 6.3%, followed by Taenia/Echinococcus spp. (2.9%), Isospora spp. (2.7%), and Toxascaris leonina (2.6%). Helminthes and protozoa were significantly more prevalent in household dogs than in stray dogs (P<0.001). There were significant differences in the prevalence of Isospora spp., T. canis and D. caninum among three age groups (P<0.05). The wide range of isolated parasites indicated that people residing in this area are at risk of exposure to these potentially hazardous zoonotic pathogens. Mass education of the general population is highly recommended to increase awareness of the potential for horizontal transmission of these parasitic infections from dogs to humans. "
2,"Intestinal parasitic infections and risk factors: a cross-sectional survey of some school children in a suburb in Accra, Ghana.","This study aimed to determine the prevalence and establish some risk factors associated with the acquisition of gastrointestinal parasitic infections in school children in Accra, Ghana.The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was 15%. Giardia lamblia (10%) and Schistosoma mansoni (1.7%) were the common parasites found. Out of the 15% students postive for intestinal parasites, 13.6% had single parasites and 1.3% had double parasitic infections. Children between the ages of 4-5 and 6-7??years (20% each) had the most parasitic infections. The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was not significantly related to gender (p??=??0.1451), and source of drinking water (p??=??0.8832). However, a statistically significant association between children infected with parasites and close proximity to domestic animals or pets was observed (p??=??0.0284). Continuous education on personal hygiene, environmental sanitation and deworming of domestic animals or pets are required to reduce the prevalence of intestinal parasites in school children in Accra."
2,"Multiple origins of parasitic feminization: thelygeny and intersexuality in beach-hoppers are caused by paramyxid parasites, not microsporidia.","Within populations of the amphipod crustaceans Orchestia gammarellus and Orchestia aestuarensis, a proportion of females produce thelygenic (female-only) broods, which often contain intersexual individuals. This phenomenon is associated with the presence of two putative feminizing parasites, the paramyxid Paramarteilia orchestiae and the microsporidian Dictyocoela cavimanum, which frequently co-infect the same host. In order to determine which of the parasites causes feminization, Orchestia were resampled from the type locality of P. orchestiae in France and from another population in the UK. Breeding experiments indicated that female O. gammarellus infected with P. orchestiae produced a significantly higher proportion of female and intersex offspring than uninfected females, even in the absence of D. cavimanum. There was no difference in mortality between infected and uninfected broods, indicating that the paramyxid alters the sex ratio through feminization rather than male-killing. Although D. cavimanum also displays a female-biased prevalence in Orchestia populations, this is due to co-infection with P. orchestiae, indicating that the paramyxid, rather than the microsporidian, is the cause of feminization in these Orchestia populations."
2,"Parasitic contamination of fresh vegetables sold at central markets in Khartoum state, Sudan.","Fresh vegetables are considered as vital nutrients of a healthy diet as they supply the body with essential supplements. The consumption of raw vegetables is the main way for transmission of intestinal parasitic organisms. This study was aimed at detecting the parasitic contamination in fresh vegetables sold in two central open-aired markets in Khartoum state, Sudan.In this prospective cross-sectional study, a total of 260 fresh vegetable samples and 50 water samples used to sprinkle vegetable(s) were collected from two central open-aired markets (namely; Elshaabi and Central markets) during November 2011 to May 2012. The samples were microscopically examined for detection of parasitic life forms using standardized parasitological techniques for protozoans and helminthes worms.Of the 260 fresh vegetable samples, 35 (13.5??%) were microscopically positive for intestinal parasites whereas 7/50 (14??%) of water samples used to sprinkle vegetable(s) were found positives. Remarkably, high level of contamination in fresh vegetable samples was recorded in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) 36.4??% (4/11) while cayenne pepper (Capsicum annuum) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) were not contaminated. The identified protozoans and helminthes were Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Entamoeba coli, Giardia lamblia, Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis, T. trichiura and hookworms. The most predominant parasite encountered was E. histolytica/dispar (42.9??%) whereas both T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides (2.9??%) were the least detected parasites. None of the fresh vegetables had single parasitic contamination. The highest percentages found in water samples used to sprinkle vegetable(s) was for Strongyloides larvae 60??% (3/5). It is worth-mentioned that the rate of contamination in Elshaabi market was higher compared with Central market. However, there was no significant correlation between the type of vegetables and existence of parasites in both markets and a high significant relationship was observed between the type of parasite and total prevalence in fresh vegetables (p??=??0.000).The study has identified a moderate rate of fresh vegetables contaminated with protozoan and helminthes. Contaminated fresh vegetables in central markets of Khartoum state may play a significant role in transmission of intestinal parasitic infections to humans, and the water used by greengrocers to sprinkle vegetable(s) can be implicated in vegetable contamination."
2,Update on pathology of ocular parasitic disease.,"Parasites are a group of eukaryotic organisms that may be free-living or form a symbiotic or parasitic relationship with the hosts. Consisting of over 800,000 recognized species, parasites may be unicellular (Protozoa) or multicellular (helminths and arthropods). The association of parasites with human population started long before the emergence of civilization. Parasitic zoonotic diseases are prevalent worldwide including India. Appropriate epidemiological data are lacking on existing zoonotic parasitic diseases, and newer diseases are emerging in our scenario. Systemic diseases such as cysticercosis, paragonimiasis, hydatidosis, and toxoplasmosis are fairly common. Acquired Toxoplasma infections are rising in immune-deficient individuals. Amongst the ocular parasitic diseases, various protozoas such as Cystoidea, trematodes, tissue flagellates, sporozoas etc. affect humans in general and eyes in particular, in different parts of the world. These zoonoses seem to be a real health related problem globally. Recent intensification of research throughout the world has led to specialization in biological fields, creating a conducive situation for researchers interested in this subject. The basics of parasitology lie in morphology, pathology, and with recent updates in molecular parasitology, the scope has extended further. The current review is to address the recent update in ophthalmic parasites with special reference to pathology and give a glimpse of further research in this field."
2,Medical Parasitology Taxonomy Update: January 2012 to December 2015.,"Parasites of medical importance have long been classified taxonomically by morphological characteristics. However, molecular-based techniques have been increasingly used and relied on to determine evolutionary distances for the basis of rational hierarchal classifications. This has resulted in several different classification schemes for parasites and changes in parasite taxonomy. The purpose of this Minireview is to provide a single reference for diagnostic laboratories that summarizes new and revised clinically relevant parasite taxonomy from January 2012 through December 2015."
2,"Prehistoric Pathoecology as Represented by Parasites of a Mummy from the Perua??u Valley, Brazil.","Paleopathologists have begun exploring the pathoecology of parasitic diseases in relation to diet and environment. We are summarizing the parasitological findings from a mummy in the site of Lapa do Boquete, a Brazilian cave in the state of Minas Gerais. These findings in context of the archaeology of the site provided insights into the pathoecology of disease transmission in cave and rockshelter environments. We are presenting a description of the site followed by the evidence of hookworm, intestinal fluke, and <i>Trypanosoma</i> infection with resulting Chagas disease in the mummy discovered in the cave. These findings are used to reconstruct the transmission ecology of the site."
2,"Mini-FLOTAC, an innovative direct diagnostic technique for intestinal parasitic infections: experience from the field.","Soil-transmitted helminths and intestinal protozoa infection are widespread in developing countries, yet an accurate diagnosis is rarely performed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the recently developed mini-FLOTAC method and to compare with currently more widely used techniques for the diagnosis of intestinal parasitic infections in different settings.The study was carried out in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India, and in Bukumbi, Tanzania. A total of 180 pupils from two primary schools had their stool analyzed (n = 80 in Dharamsala and n = 100 in Bukumbi) for intestinal parasitic infections with three diagnostic methods: direct fecal smear, formol-ether concentration method (FECM) and mini-FLOTAC. Overall, 72% of the pupils were positive for any intestinal parasitic infection, 24% carried dual infections and 11% three infections or more. The most frequently encountered intestinal parasites were Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Giardia intestinalis, hookworm, (and Schistosoma mansoni, in Tanzania). Statistically significant differences were found in the detection of parasitic infections among the three methods: mini-FLOTAC was the most sensitive method for helminth infections (90% mini-FLOTAC, 60% FECM, and 30% direct fecal smear), whereas FECM was most sensitive for intestinal protozoa infections (88% FECM, 70% direct fecal smear, and 68% mini-FLOTAC).We present the first experiences with the mini-FLOTAC for the diagnosis of intestinal helminths and protozoa. Our results suggest that it is a valid, sensitive and potentially low-cost alternative technique that could be used in resource-limited settings--particularly for helminth diagnosis."
2,Prevalence of Opportunistic Intestinal Parasites and Associated Factors among HIV Patients while Receiving ART at Arba Minch Hospital in Southern Ethiopia: A Cross-sectional Study.,"Opportunistic Intestinal Parasites (OIPs) commonly cause morbidity in HIV/AIDS patients due to the decline of CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cells. The burden of Opportunistic Intestinal Parasitic Infections (OIPIs) in Ethiopia is expected to be high due to poor sanitation and co-pandemicity of HIV/AIDs. Therefore, frequent assessment of the magnitude and associated factors for intestinal parasitosis is essential for the management of HIV/AIDS patients.A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted among patients attending Arba Minch Hospital Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Clinic from March to June 2016. Stool specimens were processed for parasitological examination using direct wet mount, formol-ether sedimentation and modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining techniques. CD4+ T-cell count data were taken from patients' medical records. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics and possible associated factors for OIPIs. All the data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.Two hundred and twenty ART patients participated in the study. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections was 28.18% while that of OIPIs alone was 17.72%. Among identified intestinal parasites, Cryptosporidium species accounts for the highest frequency (19/220, 8.63%), followed by Cyclospora species (13/220, 5.90%). Presence of domestic animals (AOR=2.07, 95%CI:1.07-8.40, P= 0.032) and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count <500cell/??l (AOR=4.66, 95%CI:1.17-5.35, P= 0.001) were significantly associated with OIPIs.The study indicated that co-infection rate of OIPs is high among ART patients. It also found that contact with domestic animals and having CD4+ count <500 cell/??l predict for the presence of OIPs."
2,High diversity of blood-associated parasites and bacteria in European wild cats in Bosnia and Herzegovina: A molecular study.,"Wild felids may play a significant role in the transmission of various pathogens to domestic cats, in particular, but also to other animals and humans. However, since data on the occurrence of blood-borne organisms in European wild cats (Felis silvestris silvestris) are scarce, the present study aimed to provide an insight into the genetic diversity of the agents carried by this sylvatic species in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to elucidate their pathogenic impact. Tissue samples from 18 adult wild cats were collected and examined by PCR and histopathology. Five species of apicomplexan parasites belonging to three genera (Babesia sp., Cytauxzoon sp., Hepatozoon silvestris, H. felis, Hepatozoon sp.), as well as two different sequence types of undescribed hemotropic mycoplasmas (designated as type A and type B), were identified in 15 animals (83%). Histopathology revealed no relevant lesions associated with any of the agents detected. The results clearly showed that European wild cats can harbour a broad range of blood-associated parasites and bacteria. However, further studies are required to investigate the possible implication of hematophagous arthropod vectors in their transmission and to clarify the true pathogenic significance of these organisms. Direct transmission of the agents by bites should also be considered as an alternative, non-vectorial route of transmission in wild cats."
2,Identification of opportunistic enteric parasites among immunocompetent patients with diarrhoea from Northern India and genetic characterisation of Cryptosporidium and Microsporidia.,"Enteric parasitic infestation is a major public health problem in developing countries. Parasites such as Cryptosporidium spp., Cyclospora spp., Cystoisospora spp. and Microsporidia may cause severe diarrhoea among immunocompromised patients. There is scanty data on their frequency among immunocompetent patients. Accordingly, we studied the frequency of enteric opportunistic parasites among immunocompetent patients with diarrhoea from northern India; we also performed genetic characterisation of Cryptosporidia and Microsporidia among them.Stool samples from 80 immunocompetent patients with diarrhoea, and 110 healthy controls were examined. Parasites were detected by direct microscopy, modified acid-fast (Kinyoun's) and modified trichrome stain. Polymerase chain reaction--restriction fragment length polymorphism was used for genetic characterisation of selected species such as Cryptosporidia and Microsporidia.Enteric parasites were detected in 16/80 (20%) patients (mean age 28.8??20 years, 45, 56% males) and in 2/110 (1.8%) healthy controls (P=0.00007). Parasites detected were Cryptosporidium spp. (8/16, 50.0%), Cystoisospora spp. (4/16, 25%), Microsporidia (1/16, 6.25%), Cyclospora spp. (1/16, 6.25%) and Giardia spp. (1/16, 6.25%). One patient had mixed infection with Cystoisospora spp. and Giardia spp. The species of Cryptosporidia and Microsporidia detected were Cryptosporidium hominis and Enterocytozoon bieneusi, respectively. Parasites were more often detected in younger patients (???20 years of age) than in older. Most of the parasite infected patients presented with chronic diarrhoea.Opportunistic enteric parasitic infestation was more common among immunocompetent patients with diarrhoea than healthy subjects. Special staining as well as molecular methods are essential for appropriate diagnosis of these parasites."
2,"Diagnosing Polyparasitism in a High-Prevalence Setting in Beira, Mozambique: Detection of Intestinal Parasites in Fecal Samples by Microscopy and Real-Time PCR.","Many different intestinal parasite species can co-occur in the same population. However, classic diagnostic tools can only frame a particular group of intestinal parasite species. Hence, one or two tests do not suffice to provide a complete picture of infecting parasite species in a given population. The present study investigated intestinal parasitic infections in Beira, Mozambique, i.e. in the informal settlement of Inhamudima. Diagnostic accuracy of five classical microscopy techniques and real-time PCR for the detection of a broad spectrum of parasites was compared.A cross-sectional population-based survey was performed. One stool sample per participant (n = 303) was examined by direct smear, formal-ether concentration (FEC), Kato smear, Baermann method, coproculture and real-time PCR. We found that virtually all people (96%) harbored at least one helminth, and that almost half (49%) harbored three helminths or more. Remarkably, Strongyloides stercoralis infections were widespread with a prevalence of 48%, and Ancylostoma spp. prevalence was higher than that of Necator americanus (25% versus 15%), the hookworm species that is often assumed to prevail in East-Africa. Among the microscopic techniques, FEC was able to detect the broadest spectrum of parasite species. However, FEC also missed a considerable number of infections, notably S. stercoralis, Schistosoma mansoni and G. intestinalis. PCR outperformed microscopy in terms of sensitivity and range of parasite species detected.We showed intestinal parasites-especially helminths-to be omnipresent in Inhamudima, Beira. However, it is a challenge to achieve high diagnostic sensitivity for all species. Classical techniques such as FEC are useful for the detection of some intestinal helminth species, but they lack sensitivity for other parasite species. PCR can detect intestinal parasites more accurately but is generally not feasible in resource-poor settings, at least not in peripheral labs. Hence, there is a need for a more field-friendly, sensitive approach for on-the-spot diagnosis of parasitic infections."
2,Geospatial distribution of intestinal parasitic infections in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and its association with social determinants.,"Intestinal parasitic infections remain among the most common infectious diseases worldwide. This study aimed to estimate their prevalence and provide a detailed analysis of geographical distribution of intestinal parasites in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, considering demographic, socio-economic, and epidemiological contextual factors.The cross-section survey was conducted among individuals attending the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (FIOCRUZ, RJ) during the period from April 2012 to February 2015. Stool samples were collected and processed by sedimentation, flotation, Kato-Katz, Baermann-Moraes and Graham methods, iron haematoxylin staining and safranin staining. Of the 3245 individuals analysed, 569 (17.5%) were infected with at least one parasite. The most common protozoa were Endolimax nana (28.8%), Entamoeba coli (14.8%), Complex Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar (13.5%), Blastocystis hominis (12.7%), and Giardia lamblia (8.1%). Strongyloides stercoralis (4.3%), Schistosoma mansoni (3.3%), Ascaris lumbricoides (1.6%), and hookworms (1.5%) were the most frequent helminths. There was a high frequency of contamination by protozoa (87%), and multiple infections were observed in 141 participants (24.8%). A positive association between age (young children) and gender (male) with intestinal parasites was observed. Geospatial distribution of the detected intestinal parasitic infections was not random or homogeneous, but was influenced by socioeconomic conditions (through the material deprivation index (MDI)). Participants classified in the highest levels of deprivation had higher risk of having intestinal parasites.This study provides the first epidemiological information on the prevalence and distribution of intestinal parasitic infections in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area. Intestinal parasites, especially protozoa, are highly prevalent, indicating that parasitic infections are still a serious public health problem. MDI showed that intestinal parasites were strongly associated with the socioeconomic status of the population, thus making it possible to identify social vulnerable areas."
2,A European network for food-borne parasites (Euro-FBP): meeting report on 'Analytical methods for food-borne parasites in human and veterinary diagnostics and in food matrices'.,"Food-borne parasites (FBPs) are a neglected topic in food safety, partly due to a lack of awareness of their importance for public health, especially as symptoms tend not to develop immediately after exposure. In addition, methodological difficulties with both diagnosis in infected patients and detection in food matrices result in under-detection and therefore the potential for underestimation of their burden on our societies. This, in consequence, leads to lower prioritization for basic research, e.g. for development new and more advanced detection methods for different food matrices and diagnostic samples, and thus a vicious circle of neglect and lack of progress is propagated. The COST Action FA1408, A European Network for Foodborne Parasites (Euro-FBP) aims to combat the impact of FBP on public health by facilitating the multidisciplinary cooperation and partnership between groups of researchers and between researchers and stakeholders. The COST Action TD1302, the European Network for cysticercosis/taeniosis, CYSTINET, has a specific focus on Taenia solium and T. saginata, two neglected FBPs, and aims to advance knowledge and understanding of these zoonotic disease complexes via collaborations in a multidisciplinary scientific network. This report summarizes the results of a meeting within the Euro-FBP consortium entitled 'Analytical methods for food-borne parasites in human and veterinary diagnostics and in food matrices' and of the joined Euro-FBP and CYSTINET meeting."
2,Identification of parasitic communities within European ticks using next-generation sequencing.,"Risk assessment of tick-borne and zoonotic disease emergence necessitates sound knowledge of the particular microorganisms circulating within the communities of these major vectors. Assessment of pathogens carried by wild ticks must be performed without a priori, to allow for the detection of new or unexpected agents.We evaluated the potential of Next-Generation Sequencing techniques (NGS) to produce an inventory of parasites carried by questing ticks. Sequences corresponding to parasites from two distinct genera were recovered in Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in Eastern France: Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. Four Babesia species were identified, three of which were zoonotic: B. divergens, Babesia sp. EU1 and B. microti; and one which infects cattle, B. major. This is the first time that these last two species have been identified in France. This approach also identified new sequences corresponding to as-yet unknown organisms similar to tropical Theileria species.Our findings demonstrate the capability of NGS to produce an inventory of live tick-borne parasites, which could potentially be transmitted by the ticks, and uncovers unexpected parasites in Western Europe."
2,Investigation of gastrointestinal parasites of dairy cattle around Taiwan.,"Parasitic nematodes are one of the most important causes of production losses in most cattle-producing countries of the world. The aim of the present study is to make a through estimate of helminth and protozoan infection prevalence in dairy cattle around Taiwan.Coprological techniques, including direct fecal smear, simple flotation, and simple sedimentation, were used to detect gastrointestinal helminths and protozoan in dairy cattle. A total of 1259 rectal fecal samples were collected from Holstein dairy cattle at 94 farms in 13 counties in Taiwan.The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal parasitic infection was 86.9%. The infection rates of protozoa, nematodes, trematodes, and cestodes were 81.3%, 7.9%, 1.6%, and 0.6%, respectively. Among all parasites, Buxtonella sulcata (61.7%) was the most predominant one, followed with Cryptosporidium spp. (32.6%) and Eimeria spp. (11.8%). There were significant differences in the prevalence of protozoa and nematodes between different age groups and distributional area groups.The present study demonstrated that gastrointestinal parasitic infections occur frequently in dairy cattle around Taiwan, especially protozoan infections. The results indicated that a superior management system and regular anthelmintic treatment should be used for the control of parasitic infections in dairy cattle farms."
2,"Taxonomy, distribution and prevalence of parasites of tigerfish, Hydrocynus vittatus (Castelnau, 1861) in the Sanyati basin, Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe.","Parasites of the tigerfish (Hydrocynus vittatus) were investigated in the period October 2014 to July 2015 in the Sanyati Basin, Lake Kariba. The fish were collected using seine netting and also during the annual Kariba International Tiger Fishing Tournament. A total of 80 fish specimens (24 males and 56 females) were collected and were infected with the following seven parasite taxa: Monogenea (Annulotrema sp.1 from the gills and Annulotrema sp.2 from the skin), Nematoda (Contracaecum larvae), Cestoda (bothriocephalid, larval cyclophyllid), Copepoda (Lamproglena hemprichii), pentastomid, Myxosporea (Myxobolus sp.,) and unicellular ciliate parasites (Trichodina sp., Tetrahymena sp., and unidentified). Annulotrema sp. 1 was observed in all fish and had the highest prevalence, mean intensity and abundance. The fish organs infected were gills, skin, fin, body cavity, stomach, intestines, mesentery, liver, kidney, brain cavity and swim bladder. No parasites were observed in the muscle, eyes and blood. The distribution of the parasites was highest in the gills and lowest in the brain cavity and swimbladder. Bothriocephalids, pentastomes and Trichodina sp. were not observed in male fish. Sex was not related to the intensity of parasites. The results of the study showed that H. vittatus has a richer parasite community than other previous investigated alestids. Pentastomes, Myxobolus sp., Trichodina sp., Tetrahymena sp. and bothriocephalid cestodes are new records for H. vittatus in Zimbabwe. "
2,Application of PCR-based methods for diagnosis of intestinal parasitic infections in the clinical laboratory.,"For many years PCR- and other DNA-based methods of pathogen detection have been available in most clinical microbiology laboratories; however, until recently these tools were not routinely exploited for the diagnosis of parasitic infections. Laboratories were initially reluctant to implement PCR as incorporation of such assays within the algorithm of tools available for the most accurate diagnosis of a large variety of parasites was unclear. With regard to diagnosis of intestinal parasitic infections, the diversity of parasites that one can expect in most settings is far less than the parasitological textbooks would have you believe, hence developing a simplified diagnostic triage is feasible. Therefore the classical algorithm based on population, patient groups, use of immuno-suppressive drugs, travel history etc. is also applicable to decide when to perform and which additional techniques are to be used, if a multiplex PCR panel is used as a first-line screening diagnostic."
2,Parasites of importance for human health on edible fruits and vegetables in Nigeria: a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data.,"Contamination of edible fruits and vegetables is now a global public health issue despite their health benefits as non-pharmacological prophylaxis against chronic diseases. Studies that will harness the extent of parasitic contaminations will ensure public health protection. Here, the prevalence and distribution of parasites of importance for human health on fruits and vegetables in Nigeria were determined through a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data. The random-effects model was used to determine pooled prevalence estimate (PPE). Heterogeneity was evaluated by the Cochran's Q-test. Parasites overall PPE of 32.4% (95% CI: 0.73, 0.91) was observed from 19 eligible studies reported across 13 Nigerian states. Sub-groups PPEs ranged between 3.5% (95% CI: 0.45, 1.86) and 58.5% (95% CI: 1.40, 4.09). A high degree of heterogeneity 97.53% (95% CI: 0.30, 0.46, P: 0.000) was observed within studies and sub-groups. Cryptosporidium species were the most prevalent, while Ancylostoma duodenale and Ascaris lumbricoides had the widest geographical distribution. Pineapple (Prev: 41.3%, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.75) and lettuce (Prev: 51.5%, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.68) recorded the highest level of parasitic contamination. Parasites of importance for human health are prevalent on edible fruits and vegetables in Nigeria. Prevalence estimates were highest in the South-eastern region and during the most recent decade. Adequate washing of fruits and vegetables, on-farm irrigation of vegetables using good sources of water and adequate hygiene by food handlers will help the general public to maximize the health benefits associated with the intake of fruits and vegetables while minimizing the risk of acquiring parasitic infections."
2,Poliovirus and other enteroviruses in children infected with intestinal parasites in Nigeria.,"Poliovirus, an enterovirus, still persists in Nigeria despite the global efforts tailored towards its eradication. This study aimed to assess the impacts of poliovirus and other enteroviruses on the susceptibility of individuals to intestinal parasite infections.A cross-sectional study on the prevalence of intestinal parasites was conducted on two-sample stool specimens of 717 Nigerian children (between 1 and 19 years of age) whose poliovirus/other enteroviruses infection status had been determined.The overall prevalence of Sabin poliovirus and other related enteroviruses infections were 6.6% and 13.8%, respectively. The prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides was significantly higher than that of other intestinal parasites (p < 0.05), with children in the 0-4 year age group being the most predisposed age group to intestinal parasitic infection (OR = 11.7, CI = 9.2-15.0). While the prevalence of all species of parasites except S. mansoni showed no significant variations in children with Sabin poliovirus (p > 0.05), the prevalence of hookworms and Taenia spp. was significantly higher in children with other enteroviral infections (p < 0.05).The high risk of children of acquiring enteroviral infection through some intestinal parasites is an indication of possible association of the parasites in a more poliovirus-endemic population. A combined intervention approach for the two infections is advocated."
2,"The parasitic fauna of the European bison (Bison bonasus) (Linnaeus, 1758) and their impact on the conservation. Part 1. The summarising list of parasites noted.","During the current century, 88 species of parasites have been recorded in Bison bonasus. These are 22 species of protozoa (Trypanosoma wrublewskii, T. theileri, Giardia sp., Sarcocystis cruzi, S. hirsuta, S. hominis, S. fusiformis, Neospora caninum, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium sp., Eimeria cylindrica, E. subspherica, E. bovis, E. zuernii, E. canadensis, E. ellipsoidalis, E. alabamensis, E. bukidnonensis, E. auburnensis, E. pellita, E. brasiliensis, Babesia divergens), 4 trematodes species (Dicrocoelium dendriticum, Fasciola hepatica, Parafasciolopsis fasciolaemorpha, Paramphistomum cervi), 4 cestodes species (Taenia hydatigena larvae, Moniezia benedeni, M. expansa, Moniezia sp.), 43 nematodes species (Bunostomum trigonocephalum, B. phlebotomum, Chabertia ovina, Oesophagostomum radiatum, O. venulosum, Dictyocaulus filaria, D.viviparus, Nematodirella alcidis, Nematodirus europaeus, N. helvetianus, N. roscidus, N. filicollis, N. spathiger, Cooperia oncophora, C. pectinata, C. punctata, C. surnabada, Haemonchus contortus, Mazamastrongylus dagestanicus, Ostertagia lyrata, O. ostertagi, O. antipini, O. leptospicularis, O. kolchida, O. circumcincta, O. trifurcata, Spiculopteragia boehmi, S. mathevossiani, S. asymmetrica, Trichostrongylus axei, T. askivali, T. capricola, T. vitrinus, Ashworthius sidemi, Onchocerca lienalis, O. gutturosa, Setaria labiatopapillosa, Gongylonema pulchrum, Thelazia gulosa, T. skrjabini, T. rhodesi, Aonchotheca bilobata, Trichuris ovis), 7 mites (Demodex bisonianus, D. bovis, Demodex sp., Chorioptes bovis, Psoroptes equi, P. ovis, Sarcoptes scabiei), 4 Ixodidae ticks (Ixodes ricinus, I. persulcatus, I. hexagonus, Dermacentor reticulatus), 1 Mallophaga species (Bisonicola sedecimdecembrii), 1 Anoplura (Haematopinus eurysternus), and 2 Hippoboscidae flies (Lipoptena cervi, Melophagus ovinus). There are few monoxenous parasites, many typical for cattle and many newly acquired from Cervidae. "
2,"Occurrence of gastrointestinal parasites in wild animals in State of Paran??, Brazil.","The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and diversity of gastrointestinal parasites in fecal samples from wild birds and mammals from the State of Paran??. In total, 220 stool samples were sent to Parasitic Diseases Laboratory of the Federal University of Paran?? during 13 months (Jan/2013-Jan/2014). A total of 52.7% (116/220) of the animals were positive for cysts, oocysts, eggs and/or trophozoites. In birds, the positivity rate was 37.9% (25/66) and mammals was 59.1% (91/154). Strongyloidea superfamily eggs were observed in 37.3% (82/220) of the samples, Eimeria spp. in 10% (22/220), and Trichuris spp. in 4.5% (10/220). The most frequent mammal species were llamas (Lama glama), and dromedaries (Camelus bactrianus) with infection rate of 70.1% (54/77) and 60.8% (14/23), respectively. In other hand, cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) and ring necks (Psittacula krameri), were the most researched birds, with infection rate of 20% (40/50) and 100% (6/6), respectively. A high prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites was observed in most of wildlife animals. Further investigations should be conducted focusing on parasite control strategies and the conservation measurements for harmonizing the human-animal interaction on the long-term, reducing associated health risks."
2,"The past, present and future of fluorescent protein tags in anaerobic protozoan parasites.","The world health organization currently recognizes diarrhoeal diseases as a significant cause of death in children globally. Protozoan parasites such as Giardia and Entamoeba that thrive in the oxygen-deprived environment of the human gut are common etiological agents of diarrhoea. In the urogenital tract of humans, the anaerobic protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis is notorious as the most common non-viral, sexually transmitted pathogen. Even with high medical impact, our understanding of anaerobic parasite physiology is scarce and as a result, treatment choices are limited. Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are invaluable tools as genetically encoded protein tags for advancing knowledge of cellular function. These FP tags emit fluorescent colours and once attached to a protein of interest, allow tracking of parasite proteins in the dynamic cellular space. Application of green FPs-like FPs in anaerobic protozoans is hindered by their oxygen dependency. In this review, we examine aspects of anaerobic parasite biology that clash with physio-chemical properties of FPs and limit their use as live-parasite protein tags. We expose novel FPs, such as miniSOG that do not require oxygen for signal production. The potential use of novel FPs has the opportunity to leverage the anaerobe parasitologist toolkit to that of aerobe parasitologist. "
2,Parasites as biological tags of fish stocks: a meta-analysis of their discriminatory power.,"The use of parasites as biological tags to discriminate among marine fish stocks has become a widely accepted method in fisheries management. Here, we first link this approach to its unstated ecological foundation, the decay in the similarity of the species composition of assemblages as a function of increasing distance between them, a phenomenon almost universal in nature. We explain how distance decay of similarity can influence the use of parasites as biological tags. Then, we perform a meta-analysis of 61 uses of parasites as tags of marine fish populations in multivariate discriminant analyses, obtained from 29 articles. Our main finding is that across all studies, the observed overall probability of correct classification of fish based on parasite data was about 71%. This corresponds to a two-fold improvement over the rate of correct classification expected by chance alone, and the average effect size (Zr = 0??463) computed from the original values was also indicative of a medium-to-large effect. However, none of the moderator variables included in the meta-analysis had a significant effect on the proportion of correct classification; these moderators included the total number of fish sampled, the number of parasite species used in the discriminant analysis, the number of localities from which fish were sampled, the minimum and maximum distance between any pair of sampling localities, etc. Therefore, there are no clear-cut situations in which the use of parasites as tags is more useful than others. Finally, we provide recommendations for the future usage of parasites as tags for stock discrimination, to ensure that future applications of the method achieve statistical rigour and a high discriminatory power."
2,Revealing the parasitic infection in diarrheic yaks by piloting high-throughput sequencing.,"Diarrhea a serious disease, reported to be related with changes in microbial diversity is widely epidemic in the yaks on the Qinghai Tibet plateau. Herein, we preformed high-throughput sequencing of the parasitic diversity in 3 groups of yaks i.e. healthy adult yaks (HA), diarrheic adult yaks (DA) and diarrheic yak calves (DC) in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The results showed that 2 Phyla, 3 Classes, 5 Orders, 4 Families and 6 Genera were discovered in HA yaks; 2 Phyla, 3 Classes, 6 Orders, 6 Families and 8 Genera were found in DA yaks while 2 Phyla, 5 Classes, 5 Orders, 10 Families and 7 Genera were observed in DC yaks. At Phylum level, Nematoda and Apicomplexa were detected in all three yak groups; however, Apicomplexa was found to be conspicuously higher in the DC yaks as compared to DA yaks (p?€?<?€?0.05). At Class level, Litostomatea, Chromadorea and Gregarinasina were found in all three yak groups, while Spirotrichea and Colpodea were only found in the DC yaks. At Order level, Vestibuliferida, Tritrichomonadida, Rhabditida and Eugregarinorida were observed in all three yak groups; and Neogregarinorida was noted HA and DC yaks while Trichomonadida and Hypotrichomonadida were only found in DA yaks. Tritrichomonadida was found to be relatively higher in the DA yaks when compared with HA yaks (p?€?<?€?0.05) and DC yaks (p?€?<?€?0.05). At Family level, Simplicimonadidae and Haemonchidae were found in all three yak groups. Trichostrongylidae was observed in both HA and DA yak groups. Syncystidae was established in both HA and DC yak groups except DA yaks. Trichomonadidae and Dictyocaulidae were only found in DA yaks. Plectidae, Strongylidae, Echinamoebidae, Lecudinidae, Pseudokeronopsidae and Panagrolaimidae were only discovered in DC yaks. Simplicimonadidae was found to be remarkably higher in DA yaks as compared to HA and DC yak groups (p?€?<?€?0.05); and Haemonchidae was detected at higher levels in HA yaks as compared to DA and DC yaks (p?€?<?€?0.05). At Genus level, Entamoeba, Buxtonella and Haemonchus were found in all three yak groups. Plectus and Echinamoeba were only found in DC yaks; while Trichostrongylus and Trepomonas were observed in HA and DA yak groups. The genus Gregarina was found in both diarrheic yak groups; while the genera of Tetratrichomonas and Dictyocaulus were observed in DA yaks only. The present study herein reported an insight of the change of parasitic diversity in diarrheic yaks at high altitude area, which shall make contribution towards the solid prevention of diarrhea in yaks."
2,Anti-parasitic activity of polyether ionophores.,"Despite some progress in recent years, the fight against parasitic diseases still remains a great challenge. Parasitic diseases affect primarily (but not exclusively) the poorest people living in underdeveloped regions of the world. The distribution of parasitoses are linked to tropical and subtropical climate conditions, to population growth and to impoverishment. If not treated, parasitic diseases may lead to serious health problems, and even death. Particularly vulnerable groups include infants and young children, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. Polyether ionophore antibiotics (ionophores), traditionally used in veterinary medicine as anti-coccidial feed additives and non-hormonal growth promoters, are of considerable interest, as they have been found to be highly effective agents against various parasites, both in??vitro and in??vivo. This review summarizes the anti-parasitic effects of the most important polyether ionophores against parasites that are responsible for a number of animal and human parasitic diseases. Recent findings and advances that support the potential of polyether ionophore antibiotics as novel anti-parasitic drug candidates are also presented and discussed."
2,"Molecular characterisation of protist parasites in human-habituated mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), humans and livestock, from Bwindi impenetrable National Park, Uganda.","Over 60 % of human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, and there is growing evidence of the zooanthroponotic transmission of diseases from humans to livestock and wildlife species, with major implications for public health, economics, and conservation. Zooanthroponoses are of relevance to critically endangered species; amongst these is the mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) of Uganda. Here, we assess the occurrence of Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Giardia, and Entamoeba infecting mountain gorillas in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda, using molecular methods. We also assess the occurrence of these parasites in humans and livestock species living in overlapping/adjacent geographical regions.Diagnostic PCR detected Cryptosporidium parvum in one sample from a mountain gorilla (IIdA23G2) and one from a goat (based on SSU). Cryptosporidium was not detected in humans or cattle. Cyclospora was not detected in any of the samples analysed. Giardia was identified in three human and two cattle samples, which were linked to assemblage A, B and E of G. duodenalis. Sequences defined as belonging to the genus Entamoeba were identified in all host groups. Of the 86 sequence types characterised, one, seven and two have been recorded previously to represent genotypes of Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Entamoeba, respectively, from humans, other mammals, and water sources globally.This study provides a snapshot of the occurrence and genetic make-up of selected protists in mammals in and around BINP. The genetic analyses indicated that 54.6% of the 203 samples analysed contained parasites that matched species, genotypes, or genetic assemblages found globally. Seventy-six new sequence records were identified here for the first time. As nothing is known about the zoonotic/zooanthroponotic potential of the corresponding parasites, future work should focus on wider epidemiological investigations together with continued surveillance of all parasites in humans, other mammals, the environment, and water in this highly impoverished area."
2,"Moonlighting proteins as virulence factors of pathogenic fungi, parasitic protozoa and multicellular parasites.","The delicate balance between eukaryotic pathogens and their human hosts during the initiation and development of infection is a complex process involving many diverse interactions. Different infectious agents, including pathogenic fungi, parasitic protozoa and multicellular parasites, directly interact through their cell surface with epithelial or endothelial cells of the human host as well as various proteinaceous host ligands such as extracellular matrix or plasma proteins. Eukaryotic pathogens possess a number of virulence factors but a relatively recently recognized and particularly interesting group of factors capable of enhancing virulence is the set of so-called 'moonlighting proteins'. This term was coined for a relatively large collection of housekeeping enzymes lacking special targeting motifs that would determine their extracellular localization, but that are often present at the cell surface of pathogen. Several such enzymes with key metabolic functions in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate cycle or other fundamental intracellular processes perform entirely new, non-catalytic roles often associated with adhesion to host ligands. Our current study summarizes some of the current knowledge of interesting moonlighting proteins which play putative or confirmed roles as virulence factors in pathogenic fungi, parasitic protozoa and multicellular parasites."
2,A survey for potentially zoonotic gastrointestinal parasites of dogs and pigs in Cambodia.,"There is little information available on parasites of zoonotic significance in Cambodia. In 2011, in an effort to obtain data on potentially zoonotic gastrointestinal parasites in domestic animals, 50 dogs and 30 pigs residing in 38 households located in Ang Svay Check village, Takeo province, Cambodia were examined for parasites from faecal samples. The samples were processed using the formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT). Hookworms were the most common zoonotic parasite found in dogs (80.0%) followed by Echinostomes (18.0%). While, in pigs, Fasciolopsis buski was the most common zoonotic parasite (30.0%) followed by Ascaris suum (13.3%). This study provides baseline data on gastrointestinal parasites in dogs and pigs from Cambodia and underscores the importance of domestic animals as reservoir hosts for human parasites for Cambodian veterinary and public health agencies. Follow-up studies are required to further taxonomically characterize these dog and pig parasites and to determine their role in human parasites in this community."
2,Geographical location and age affects the incidence of parasitic infestations in school children.,"Environmental factors affect the dissemination and distribution of intestinal parasites in human communities. To comprehend the prevalence of parasitic infestation and to examine whether geographical location and age also influence the prevalence of infection, fecal samples from 195 school children (rural = 95; male = 39; female = 56) (urban = 100; male = 60; female = 40) of five age groups ranging from 5 to 11 years in two different socio-economic zones (rural and urban) were screened for specific intestinal parasites using standard histological techniques. Percentage incidences of parasitic species found in fecal wet mounts and concentrates in rural children were Entamoeba coli (25.3%), Giardia lamblia (17.9%), Blastocystis hominis (14.7%), Entamoeba histolytica (4.2%), Iodamoeba butschlii (1.1%), Hymenolepis nana (1.1%) and Ascaris lumbricoides (1.1%). Whereas the percentage incidences among urban children were E. coli (26%), A. lumbricoides (21%), B. hominis (18%), G. lamblia (14%), T. trichiura (8%), I. butschlii (4%) and A. duodenale (1%). Such findings may be related to dietary differences, living conditions and the greater use of natural anti-helminthic medicinal plants in rural communities. These results are important for both epidemiological data collection and for correlating dietary differences to intestinal parasitic diseases.We chose to investigate whether geographical location and age affect the prevalence and distribution of intestinal parasites among school children from two separate regions (rural and urban) in areas surrounding, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.A study of the prevalence of parasitic infestations was undertaken among primary school children, in rural and urban communities around Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.Faecal sample collection, direct microscopic techniques, macroscopic examination and concentration techniques for identifying the parasites.Percentage incidences of parasitic species found in faecal wet mounts and concentrates were done instead of statistical analyses.Both macroscopic and microscopic examinations of faecal samples revealed that the overall percentage prevalence of parasite species encountered in rural children were Entamoeba coli (25.3%), G. lamblia (17.9%), B. hominis (14.7%), Entamoeba histolytica (4.2%), I. butschlii (1.1%), H. nana (1.1%), Ascaris lumbricoides (1.1%). The prevalence among urban children were E. coli (26%), A. lumbricoides (21%), B. hominis (18%), G. lamblia (14%), T. trichiura (8%), I. butschlii (4%) and A. duodenale (1%). Overall, comparative significant differences were noted between rural and urban children for E. histolytica (4.2 vs. 14%), G. lamblia (17.9 vs. 14%), A. lumbricoides (1.1 vs. 21%) and T. trichiura (0 vs. 8%), with the major difference being the much higher occurrence of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infections in urban children.One of the greatest challenges for healthcare professionals is the prevention and treatment of protozoal and helminthic parasitic infections. From our study we conclude that the prevalence of different pathogenic species of amoeba such as Entamoeba histolytica (4.2 vs. 0%) and G. lamblia (17.9 vs. 14%), (P value was equal to 1) was significantly higher among rural children compared to children from urban areas. In contrast, the prevalence of nematodes such as A. lumbricoides (21% vs. 1.1%), T. trichiura (8% vs. 0%) and A. duodenale (1%) was also significantly higher among rural children."
2,Anti-parasitic Antibodies from Phage Display.,"Parasite infections affect billions of people and their domesticated animals worldwide, and remain as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, but such diseases are still neglected in endemic countries. Therapeutic interventions consisted mostly of drugs, which are highly toxic and may lead to resistance. The immunopathology of parasites is very complex due to their multistage life cycles and long lifetime involving several hosts, leading many times to chronic infections and sometimes to death, by compromising nutritional status, affecting cognitive processes, and inducing severe tissue reactions. Vaccination is a challenge, and immunotherapy is completely disregarded because of their complex interactions with hosts and vectors. This review will bring concepts of immunological aspects for some important parasitic infections, and present the most recent phage display-derived antibodies or peptidomimetics for parasite targets. This chapter will also discuss the future perspectives of such potential anti-infective immunobiologicals for parasitic diseases."
2,"Motility, Force Generation, and Energy Consumption of Unicellular Parasites.","Motility is a key factor for pathogenicity of unicellular parasites, enabling them to infiltrate and evade host cells, and perform several of their life-cycle events. State-of-the-art methods of motility analysis rely on a combination of optical tweezers with high-resolution microscopy and microfluidics. With this technology, propulsion forces, energies, and power generation can be determined so as to shed light on the motion mechanisms, chemotactic behavior, and specific survival strategies of unicellular parasites. With these new tools in hand, we can elucidate the mechanisms of motility and force generation of unicellular parasites, and identify ways to manipulate and eventually inhibit them."
2,Morphological variations on microscopy in oocysts of coccidian parasites: A prospective study from a tertiary care hospital in north India.,"The modified acid fast staining technique is a commonly used procedure for the detection of coccidian parasites in developing countries. The morphological variations observed in these parasites play a significant role to some extent in both identification and diagnosis of these parasitic infections. A prospective cross sectional study was performed over three years. The fecal smears were stained by modified Kinyoun acid-fast staining technique and were extensively studied for morphological variations in the coccidian parasites. Out of a total of two thousand one hundred fifty one (n?€?=?€?2,151) fecal samples received during the study period, 259 samples (12%) were positive for any one of the coccidian parasites. Morphological variations, especially in the staining character was noted in all the three coccidian parasites. This study was an attempt to characterize different variations in size, shape and staining characteristics of the three coccidian parasites."
2,Blood parasites of penguins: a critical review.,"Blood parasites are considered some of the most significant pathogens for the conservation of penguins, due to the considerable morbidity and mortality they have been shown to produce in captive and wild populations of these birds. Parasites known to occur in the blood of penguins include haemosporidian protozoans (Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon, Haemoproteus), piroplamid protozoans (Babesia), kinetoplastid protozoans (Trypanosoma), spirochete bacteria (Borrelia) and nematode microfilariae. This review provides a critical and comprehensive assessment of the current knowledge on these parasites, providing an overview of their biology, host and geographic distribution, epidemiology, pathology and implications for public health and conservation."
2,"Prevalence of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and Other Gastrointestinal Parasites in Domestic Cats from Households in Thika Region, Kenya.","Gastrointestinal (GIT) parasites of domestic cats (Felis catus) not only cause morbidity but are also potential zoonotic agents. The current study aimed at establishing the prevalence of GIT parasites in cats kept by households in Thika region, Kenya. Fecal samples were collected randomly from 103 cats and analyzed for presence of parasites using standard parasitological methods. In descending order, the prevalence of the detected protozoa parasites was <i>Isospora</i> spp. 43.7% (95% CI: 40.4-47%), <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. 40.8% (95% CI: 37.5-44.1%), <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> 7.8% (95% CI: 4.5-11.1%), and <i>Entamoeba</i> spp. 2.9% (95% CI: 1.6-6.2%). The prevalence of the observed helminths was <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i> 43.7% (95% CI: 40.4-47%), <i>Toxocara cati</i> 23.3% (95% CI: 20-26.6%), <i>Ancylostoma</i> spp. 9.7% (95% CI: 6.4-13%), <i>Dipylidium caninum</i> 8.7% (95% CI: 5.4-12.0%), and <i>Acanthocephala</i> spp. 1.9% (95% CI: 1-4.2%). The percentage of cats excreting at least one species of parasite was 73.2% (95% CI = 69.9-76.5%). The study shows that the cats have high spectrum (9) of parasites which are known to affect the cat's health and some are of zoonotic significance."
2,"[The distribution of intestinal parasites in people admitted to the Y??z??nc?? Y??l University Parasitology Laboratory of Health Research and Training Hospital, in 2009].","This study was performed to present the distribution of intestinal parasites in parients admitted to the Parasitology Laboratory of the Health Research and Training Hospital of Y??z??nc?? Y??l University in 2009.A total of 6267 patients (3037 female, 3230 male; 3798 of 13 years and under, 2469 of 14 years and over) were included. The stool samples were examined by native-Lugol, flotation and sedimentation methods in the Parasitology Laboratory of the hospital. Trichrome and modified acid-fast staining methods were also applied to suspicious stools.One or more than one parasite species were found in 28.5% of 6267 examined stool samples. Parasitosis was determined in 28% of female and 29% of male. Distribution of the parasites determined in the patients was as follows: 15.4% Blastocystis hominis, 6.6% Giardia intestinalis, 4.9% Entamoeba coli, 3.2% plenty B. hominis, 1.7% Chilomastix mesnili, 1.3% Hymenolepis nana, 0.7% Iodamoeba butschlii, 0.5% Ascaris lumbricoides, 0.1% Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar, 0.1% Endolimax nana, 0.1% Enteromonas hominis, 0.1% Trichomonas hominis, 0.1% Cyclospora cayetanensis, 0.1% Enterobius vermicularis, 0.03% Entamoeba hartmanni, 0.03% Dicrocoelium dendriticum,0.03% Taenia saginata and 0.02% Trichuris trichiura.This research shows that the intestinal parasitosis problem still continues in the province."
2,Do molecules matter more than morphology? Promises and pitfalls in parasites.,"Systematics involves resolving both the taxonomy and phylogenetic placement of organisms. We review the advantages and disadvantages of the two kinds of information commonly used for such inferences--morphological and molecular data--as applied to the systematics of metazoan parasites generally, with special attention to the malaria parasites. The problems that potentially confound the use of morphology in parasites include challenges to consistent specimen preservation, plasticity of features depending on hosts or other environmental factors, and morphological convergence. Molecular characters such as DNA sequences present an alternative data source and are particularly useful when not all the parasite's life stages are present or when parasitaemia is low. Nonetheless, molecular data can bring challenges that include troublesome DNA isolation, paralogous gene copies, difficulty in developing molecular markers, and preferential amplification in mixed species infections. Given the differential benefits and shortcomings of both molecular and morphological characters, both should be implemented in parasite taxonomy and phylogenetics."
2,Parasites as drivers of key processes in aquatic ecosystems: Facts and future directions.,"Despite the advances in our understanding of the ecological importance of parasites that we have made in recent years, we are still far away from having a complete picture of the ecological implications connected to parasitism. In the present paper we highlight key issues that illustrate (1) important contributions of parasites to biodiversity, (2) their integral role in ecosystems, (3) as well as their ecological effects as keystone species (4) and in biological invasion processes. By using selected examples from aquatic ecosystems we want to provide an insight and generate interest into the topic, and want to show directions for future research in the field of ecological parasitology. This may help to convince more parasitologists and ecologists contributing and advancing our understanding of the complex and fascinating interplay of parasites, hosts and ecosystems."
2,"Prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in children under the age of 5??years attending the Debre Birhan referral hospital, North Shoa, Ethiopia.","Intestinal parasitic infection is one of the major childhood health problems in developing countries. In Ethiopia, epidemiological data for several localities is limited. Hence, the aim of this study is to assess intestinal parasitic infections among under-five children attending in Debre Birhan referral hospital, which could help to decrease morbidity and mortality in children. A cross-sectional study was conducted in February, 2014. Stool specimens were collected and examined using concentration method.Out of the 247 under-five children participated, 17.4% (95% CI 12.7-22.1%) of the children were infected with at least one or more protozoa parasites (14.2% [95% CI 9.9-18.5%]) and helminthes (3.2% [95% CI 1.0-5.4%]). Giardia lamblia (8.5%), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (5.7%), Trichuris trichiura (1.6%) and Ascaris lumbricoides (1.2%) were the most identified parasites. Parasitic infection was higher in children who had source of drinking water from the river (36.8%), among children from mothers with poor hand washing practice (31.7%), and among children born from illiterate mothers (27.5%). This revealed that intestinal parasites affect the health of under-five children in the setting. Hence, improving environmental hygiene and inadequate water sanitation, and health education for behavioral changes to personal hygiene would be crucial for effective control of the parasite infections."
2,Parasitic fauna of a yellow-legged gull colony in the island of Escombreras (South-eastern Mediterranean) in close proximity to a landfill site: potential effects on cohabiting species.,"We identified the ectoparasites and helminth fauna of yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis michahellis), breeding near to a solid waste landfill, and compared infection levels with those of other yellow-legged gull colonies. Moreover, we analysed correlations between parasites and sex and body condition of yellow-legged gulls, co-infections and the helminth community structure in order to propose the role of this species as reservoir of certain parasites. We also discuss the potential transmission of parasites between the yellow-legged gull and the endangered Audouin's gull, because interactions between these two species, such as kleptoparasitism and predation, occur frequently around colonies. The following species were recorded: Ornithodorus capensis (Arthropoda); Cosmocephalus obvelatus, Paracuaria adunca, Eucoleus contortus, Tetrameres skrjabini and Contracaecum sp. (Nematoda); Tetrabothrius cylindraceus (Cestoda); Acanthotrema armata, Cardiocephaloides longicollis and Ornithobilharzia intermedia (Digenea). Tetrabothrius cylindraceus, A. armata and O. capensis are new parasite records for this host. The dependence of yellow-legged-gulls on fishery discards is supported by the dominance of parasites transmitted through marine intermediate hosts with interest to fisheries in the study area. However, the shift in diet from natural resources to food derived from human activities seems not to affect the parasitic fauna of yellow-legged gull. Besides of direct physical contact between individuals in nesting and resting habitats, the high availability of fishery discards could increase the risk of Audouin's gulls to be infected by common parasites of yellow-legged gull. "
2,Diagnosis of intestinal parasites in a rural community of Venezuela: Advantages and disadvantages of using microscopy or RT-PCR.,"A cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence and diagnostic performance of microscopy and real time PCR (RT-PCR) for 14 intestinal parasites in a Venezuelan rural community with a long history of persistent intestinal parasitic infections despite the implementation of regular anthelminthic treatments. A total of 228 participants were included in this study. A multiplex RT-PCR was used for the detection of Dientamoeba fragilis, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium sp. and a monoplex RT-PCR for Entamoeba histolytica. Furthermore, a multiplex PCR was performed for detection of Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis, Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. Combined microscopy-PCR revealed prevalences of 49.3% for A. lumbricoides, 10.1% for N. americanus (no A. duodenale was detected), 2.0% for S. stercoralis, 40.4% for D. fragilis, 35.1% for G. intestinalis, and 7.9% for E. histolytica/dispar. Significant increases in prevalence at PCR vs. microscopy were found for A. lumbricoides, G. intestinalis and D. fragilis. Other parasites detected by microscopy alone were Trichuris trichiura (25.7%), Enterobius vermicularis (3.4%), Blastocystis sp. (65.8%), and the non-pathogenic Entamoeba coli (28.9%), Entamoeba hartmanni (12.3%), Endolimax nana (19.7%) and Iodamoeba b??tschlii (7.5%). Age- but no gender-related differences in prevalences were found for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, G. intestinalis, and E. histolytica/dispar. The persistently high prevalences of intestinal helminths are probably related to the high faecal pollution as also evidenced by the high prevalences of non-pathogenic intestinal protozoans. These results highlight the importance of using sensitive diagnostic techniques in combination with microscopy to better estimate the prevalence of intestinal parasites, especially in the case of D. fragilis trophozoites, which deteriorate very rapidly and would be missed by microscopy. In addition, the differentiation between the pathogenic E. histolytica and the non-pathogenic E. dispar can be attained. However, microscopy remains an important diagnostic tool since it can detect other intestinal parasites for which no PCR is available."
2,"Opportunistic and non-opportunistic intestinal parasites in HIV/ AIDS patients in relation to their clinical and epidemiological status in a specialized medical service in Goi??s, Brazil.","Patients infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) often have opportunistic infections, among which strongyloidiasis and coccidiosis are the most common parasitic infections that aggravate their health status. This study examined the prevalence of intestinal parasites, particularly of Strongyloides stercoralis and intestinal coccidia in patients with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/ Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) who were treated at the Specialized Assistance Service (SAE) of Jata??, State of Goi??s, Brazil, and analyzed its correlation with clinical, laboratory, and socio-epidemiological parameters. A total of 270 stool samples were analyzed by the Lutz technique, Rugai's method, Agar Plate Culture, Ritchie's method and specific staining, Ziehl-Neelsen modified technique, Kinyoun's method and the rapid safranin method. The prevalence of intestinal parasites was 28.88% including 3.8% of S. stercoralis, Cryptosporidium sp. and Cystoisospora belli. There was a significant positive correlation between intestinal parasites and the clinical status and the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), smoking, CD4+ lymphocyte counts and sexual orientation. In conclusion, the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy and health assistance contributed to the low prevalence of S. stercoralis and coccidiosis in patients with HIV/ AIDS who were followed up at the SAE."
2,Parasites of fish larvae: do they follow metabolic energetic laws?,"Eumetazoan parasites in fish larvae normally exhibit large body sizes relative to their hosts. This observation raises a question about the potential effects that parasites might have on small fish. We indirectly evaluated this question using energetic metabolic laws based on body volume and the parasite densities. We compared the biovolume as well as the numeric and volumetric densities of parasites over the host body volume of larval and juvenile-adult fish and the average of these parasitological descriptors for castrator parasites and the parasites found in the fish studied here. We collected 5266 fish larvae using nearshore zooplankton sampling and 1556 juveniles and adult fish from intertidal rocky pools in central Chile. We considered only the parasitized hosts: 482 fish larvae and 629 juvenile-adult fish. We obtained 31 fish species; 14 species were in both plankton and intertidal zones. Fish larvae exhibited a significantly smaller biovolume but larger numeric and volumetric densities of parasites than juvenile-adult fish. Therefore, fish larvae showed a large proportion of parasite biovolume per unit of body host (cm(3)). However, the general scaling of parasitological descriptors and host body volume were similar between larvae and juvenile-adult fish. The ratio between the biovolume of parasites and the host body volume in fish larvae was similar to the proportion observed in castrator parasites. Furthermore, the ratios were different from those of juvenile-adult fish, which suggests that the presence of parasites implies a high energetic cost for fish larvae that would diminish the fitness of these small hosts. "
2,Facultative parasites as evolutionary stepping-stones towards parasitic lifestyles.,"Parasites and parasitic lifestyles have evolved from free-living organisms multiple times. How such a key evolutionary transition occurred remains puzzling. Facultative parasites represent potential transitional states between free-living and fully parasitic lifestyles because they can be either free-living or parasitic depending on environmental conditions. We suggest that facultative parasites with phenotypically plastic life-history strategies may serve as evolutionary stepping-stones towards obligate parasitism. Pre-adaptations provide a starting point for the transition towards opportunistic or facultative parasitism, but what evolutionary mechanism underlies the transition from facultative to obligate parasitism? In this Opinion Piece, we outline how facultative parasites could evolve towards obligate parasites via genetic assimilation, either alone or in combination with the Baldwin effect. We further describe the key predictions stemming from each of these evolutionary pathways. The importance of genetic assimilation in evolution has been hotly debated. Studies on facultative parasites may not only provide key insights regarding the evolution of parasitism, but also provide ideal systems in which to test evolutionary theory on genetic accommodation."
2,Imported parasitic diseases in mainland China: current status and perspectives for better control and prevention.,"The high prevalence of parasitic diseases leads to millions of deaths and disabilities each year in developing countries. China has also been greatly affected by parasitic infections, including filariasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted nematodosis. However, the situation in China improved dramatically after comprehensive parasitic disease control efforts were strengthened, leading to the elimination of filariasis in 2006 and to significant control over other diseases. However, imported parasitic disease cases are inevitable, and such cases have increasingly been reported as a result of enhanced globalization and international or regional cooperation. These imported diseases represent a major obstacle to the elimination of several parasitoses, such as malaria.This paper reviews imported cases of parasitic diseases in mainland China, particularly malaria and schistosomiasis, based on data reported separately by the Chinese annual reports and from other published papers. We summarize the new challenges that face parasitic disease control efforts in mainland China and perspectives regarding better control. We argue that both the provision of professional education and updated training for medical care personnel and the management and surveillance of people entering China are essential. We recommend that Chinese migrant workers should be considered a priority group for health education and that public awareness of imported diseases should be emphasized. Furthermore, we underscore the importance of investigating the distribution of introduced/potential vectors, parasite susceptibility, and improvements in diagnostic techniques and drug stocks.Imported cases have become the main challenge to the elimination of several parasitoses, such as malaria and schistosomiasis, in mainland China. China should act to meet these challenges, which are closely associated with national biological safety."
2,Feline gastrointestinal parasitism in Greece: emergent zoonotic species and associated risk factors.,"Feline gastrointestinal parasitism constitutes an issue of concern for veterinarians since parasites are widespread and affect animals' health and welfare. Furthermore, some of these pathogens have zoonotic potential. To provide detailed data on the current epizootiology of feline endoparasitism, a multicentric survey was conducted during 2016.Faeces from 1150 cats were collected from all regions of Greece and examined by sedimentation and flotation techniques. Possible risk factors including gender, age, ownership status, living conditions and co-infections with other parasites were assessed using binary regression models for each one of the most prevalent parasites.The overall gastrointestinal parasite prevalence in cats was 50.7%. The study population consisted of cats of both sexes, different age groups, ownership status and living conditions. A total of 10 gastrointestinal parasitic species were detected and up to 5 different parasites were isolated in the same faecal sample. The most frequently identified parasites were Toxocara cati (n = 278; 24.2%), followed by Cystoisospora spp. (n = 189; 16.4%), Ancylostomatidae (n = 186; 16.2%), Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (n = 40; 3.5%), Giardia spp. (n = 26; 2.3%), Joyeuxiella pasqualei (n = 14; 1.2%), Capillaria aerophila (n = 8; 0.7%), Dipylidium caninum (n = 3; 0.2%), Toxascaris leonina (n = 2; 0.1%) and Troglostrongylus brevior (n = 2; 0.1%). The occurrence of co-infections was 11.6%. Concerning risk factors, the likelihood of T. cati infection was higher for female cats living outdoors and for cats being infected with Cystoisospora spp. In the same frame, young, stray, male and free of A. abstrusus cats were more likely to be infected with Cystoisospora spp. Correspondingly, stray, infected with Giardia spp. but free of Cystoisospora spp. cats were more likely to be infected with Ancylostomatidae. Regarding A. abstrusus infection, a higher probability was reported for cats living outdoors and for cats free of Cystoisospora spp., while Giardia spp. infections were more common in young and co-infected with Ancylostomatidae animals.The prevalence of parasitized cats in Greece was high and thus consideration should be paid to control the risk factors, to implement targeted preventive antiparasitic treatments and educate cat owners on the value of prevention for the health and welfare of their cats."
2,Distribution of Parasites Detected in Stool Samples of Patients Admitted to Our Parasitology Laboratory during a Three-Year Period between 2012 and 2014.,"Parasitic diseases are among the major public health issues worldwide. A number of tests are available for diagnosis, but the sentivity and specifity of these tests are assumed to be insufficient. Nevertheless, the most common diagnostic method is microscopic examination. In this study, we aimed to introduce the distribution of parasites detected in stool samples of patients admitted to our laboratory on the basis of parameters such as, age, and gender during a 3-year period between 2012 and 2014.In total, 6757 stool samples were included in the study. After macroscopic examination, wet mounts of all samples were examined under a light microscope using ??100 and ??400 magnification lenses. Wet mounts were prepared with physiological saline and Lugol's iodine.Parasites were detected in 3.7% (252) of the samples, while no parasites were detected in 96.3% (6505) of the samples. The distribution of intestinal parasites was as follows: Blastocystis hominis (63.5%), Giardia intestinalis (26.2%), Taenia sp. (4.8%), Enterobius vermicularis (2.4%), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (1.6%), and Hymenolepis nana (1.6%).When the burden of intestinal parasites on public health is considered, they are still a major health issue in Turkey. The frequency of parasitic diseases can be reduced by the education of individuals and implementation of effective diagnostic methods, treatments, and preventive measures."
2,Balancing knowledge and basic principles in veterinary parasitology - Competencies for future Danish veterinary graduates.,"Veterinary parasitology has always been considered to be relevant and interesting by the Danish veterinary students. Students have to acquaint themselves with many new, small creatures with complicated and varied life cycles and with intricate Latin names that are difficult to pronounce, as only a few parasites have Danish names. In our veterinary curriculum, zoology has disappeared as a discipline, and parasitology has gradually moved from the third year to the beginning of the second year, which implies that, for example, pathology and pharmacology are ""unknown fields"". The number of contact hours in veterinary parasitology has been gradually cut to 24 lectures (35?€?min each) and practical exercises (24?€?h), including 9?€?h on coprology. The course is taught and examined jointly with bacteriology and virology in a 8-week course. As a comprehensive course, it has become increasingly difficult to get students to acquire enough active knowledge of the most common parasites and an understanding of the basic principles in relation to, for example, transmission and control. Even though information is readily accessible through books and on-line resources, we still believe that a competent clinician should know a range of parasites by heart as an active resource for their work. The dilemma has been tackled (partly) by introducing a veterinary paraclinical refresher course of 18?€?h (half practicals and half lectures) in the fourth study year. The focus here is on host(herd)-oriented clinical and diagnostic parasitology. The students can also now select a One Health track for six months in which zoonotic parasites are obviously a relevant topic."
2,Prevalence of intestinal parasites among patients of a Ghanaian psychiatry hospital.,"Neglected tropical diseases are of major concern to sub-Saharan African countries. Though efforts to monitor the prevalence and control are in place, these are mostly restricted to groups within the population. This study was performed to determine the prevalence among patients of a Ghanaian psychiatric hospital and find out whether there is a reason for active monitoring in this population.A cross-sectional study was performed to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites among patients of a Ghanaian psychiatric hospital. Stool samples were collected and analyzed in addition to data.Of the 111 patients studied, asymptomatic carriage of parasites was 13.5 % and was higher in males (18.8 %) than in females (4.8 %). Carriage of parasites decreased with age but increase with duration of admission.This is the first report of parasitic pathogens among patients of a psychiatric institution in Ghana. The data shows that there are risks of transmission of infectious diseases via the oral route hence, the need for regular monitoring and intervention is emphasized."
2,Seasonal and biogeographical patterns of gastrointestinal parasites in large carnivores: wolves in a coastal archipelago.,"Parasites are increasingly recognized for their profound influences on individual, population and ecosystem health. We provide the first report of gastrointestinal parasites in gray wolves from the central and north coasts of British Columbia, Canada. Across 60 000 km(2), wolf feces were collected from 34 packs in 2005-2008. At a smaller spatial scale (3300 km(2)), 8 packs were sampled in spring and autumn. Parasite eggs, larvae, and cysts were identified using standard flotation techniques and morphology. A subset of samples was analysed by PCR and sequencing to identify tapeworm eggs (n=9) and Giardia cysts (n=14). We detected ???14 parasite taxa in 1558 fecal samples. Sarcocystis sporocysts occurred most frequently in feces (43??7%), followed by taeniid eggs (23??9%), Diphyllobothrium eggs (9??1%), Giardia cysts (6??8%), Toxocara canis eggs (2??1%), and Cryptosporidium oocysts (1??7%). Other parasites occurred in ???1% of feces. Genetic analyses revealed Echinococcus canadensis strains G8 and G10, Taenia ovis krabbei, Diphyllobothrium nehonkaiense, and Giardia duodenalis assemblages A and B. Parasite prevalence differed between seasons and island/mainland sites. Patterns in parasite prevalence reflect seasonal and spatial resource use by wolves and wolf-salmon associations. These data provide a unique, extensive and solid baseline for monitoring parasite community structure in relation to environmental change."
2,"Prevalence of parasitic contamination of raw vegetables in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, southern Thailand.","Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are major public health problems in poor and developing countries that require fecal contamination of the environment for transmission. The consumption of raw vegetables without proper washing is one of the main routes of intestinal parasite acquisition. Therefore, this study was designed to detect the prevalence of intestinal parasitic contamination in commonly consumed raw vegetables sold in three central open-air markets in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, southern Thailand.A total of 265 fresh vegetable samples consisting of peppermint, lettuce, coriander, leek, gotu kola, celery, Chinese cabbage, culantro, Thai basil, and Chinese morning glory were purchased from three central open-air markets in the Mueang, Thasala and Sichon districts from December 2016 to March 2017. Each sample was washed with physiological saline, shaken for 15?€?min, and then allowed to sediment. Finally, sedimentation was performed via the sedimentation concentration technique and examined using light microscopy for the detection of pathogenic parasites.The overall prevalence of parasitic contamination was 35.1% (93/265). The most predominant parasite was hookworms (42.9%), followed by Strongyloides stercoralis (10.6%), Trichuris trichiura (2.6%), Ascaris lumbricoides (2.6%), and Toxocara spp. (2.6%). The highest level of contamination was found in celery, with a prevalence rate of 63.3% (19/30), while the lowest contamination level was found in Chinese morning glory, with a prevalence rate of 2.0% (2/30). The prevalence of intestinal parasite contamination in Mueang district (51.5%) was significantly higher than that in Thasala district (17.9%) and Sichon district (30.6%) (P?€?<?€?0.001).The results of the present study demonstrate that consumption of vegetables with parasite contamination in this area represents a potential route for the transmission of parasitic infection, particularly hookworm infection. Therefore, it is necessary for health authorities to educate consumers about the proper washing of vegetables prior to consumption. Preventive methods such as wearing gloves and washing hands after handling vegetables should also be advocated to sellers who are at risk of acquiring STH infections via skin penetration."
2,Multi-parallel qPCR provides increased sensitivity and diagnostic breadth for gastrointestinal parasites of humans: field-based inferences on the impact of mass deworming.,"Although chronic morbidity in humans from soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections can be reduced by anthelmintic treatment, inconsistent diagnostic tools make it difficult to reliably measure the impact of deworming programs and often miss light helminth infections.Cryopreserved stool samples from 796 people (aged 2-81 years) in four villages in Bungoma County, western Kenya, were assessed using multi-parallel qPCR for 8 parasites and compared to point-of-contact assessments of the same stools by the 2-stool 2-slide Kato-Katz (KK) method. All subjects were treated with albendazole and all Ascaris lumbricoides expelled post-treatment were collected. Three months later, samples from 633 of these people were re-assessed by both qPCR and KK, re-treated with albendazole and the expelled worms collected.Baseline prevalence by qPCR (n?€?=?€?796) was 17 % for A. lumbricoides, 18 % for Necator americanus, 41 % for Giardia lamblia and 15% for Entamoeba histolytica. The prevalence was <1% for Trichuris trichiura, Ancylostoma duodenale, Strongyloides stercoralis and Cryptosporidium parvum. The sensitivity of qPCR was 98% for A. lumbricoides and N. americanus, whereas KK sensitivity was 70% and 32%, respectively. Furthermore, qPCR detected infections with T. trichiura and S. stercoralis that were missed by KK, and infections with G. lamblia and E. histolytica that cannot be detected by KK. Infection intensities measured by qPCR and by KK were correlated for A. lumbricoides (r?€?=?€?0.83, p?€?<?€?0.0001) and N. americanus (r?€?=?€?0.55, p?€?<?€?0.0001). The number of A. lumbricoides worms expelled was correlated (p?€?<?€?0.0001) with both the KK (r?€?=?€?0.63) and qPCR intensity measurements (r?€?=?€?0.60).KK may be an inadequate tool for stool-based surveillance in areas where hookworm or Strongyloides are common or where intensity of helminth infection is low after repeated rounds of chemotherapy. Because deworming programs need to distinguish between populations where parasitic infection is controlled and those where further treatment is required, multi-parallel qPCR (or similar high throughput molecular diagnostics) may provide new and important diagnostic information."
2,Sexual reproduction and genetic exchange in parasitic protists.,"A key part of the life cycle of an organism is reproduction. For a number of important protist parasites that cause human and animal disease, their sexuality has been a topic of debate for many years. Traditionally, protists were considered to be primitive relatives of the 'higher' eukaryotes, which may have diverged prior to the evolution of sex and to reproduce by binary fission. More recent views of eukaryotic evolution suggest that sex, and meiosis, evolved early, possibly in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes. However, detecting sex in these parasites is not straightforward. Recent advances, particularly in genome sequencing technology, have allowed new insights into parasite reproduction. Here, we review the evidence on reproduction in parasitic protists. We discuss protist reproduction in the light of parasitic life cycles and routes of transmission among hosts."
2,"Viruses of parasites as actors in the parasite-host relationship: A ""m??nage ?? trois"".","The complex parasite-host relationship involves multiple mechanisms. Moreover, parasites infected by viruses modify this relationship adding more complexity to the system that now comprises three partners. Viruses infecting parasites were described several decades ago. However, until recently little was known about the viruses involved and their impact on the resulting disease caused to the hosts. To clarify this situation, we have concentrated on parasitic diseases caused to humans and on how virus-infected parasites could alter the symptoms inflicted on the human host. It is clear that the effect caused to the human host depends on the virus and on the parasite it has infected. Consequently, the review is divided as follows: Viruses with a possible effect on the virulence of the parasite. This section reviews pertinent articles showing that infection of parasites by viruses might increase the detrimental effect of the tandem virus-parasite on the human host (hypervirulence) or decrease virulence of the parasite (hypovirulence). Parasites as vectors affecting the transmission of viruses. In some cases, the virus-infected parasite might facilitate the transfer of the virus to the human host. Parasites harboring viruses with unidentified effects on their host. In spite of recently renewed interest in parasites in connection with their viruses, there still remains a number of cases in which the effect of the virus of a given parasite on the human host remains ambiguous. The triangular relationship between the virus, the parasite and the host, and the modulation of the pathogenicity and virulence of the parasites by viruses should be taken into account in the rationale of fighting against parasites."
2,Parasitic infections and resource economy of Danish Iron Age settlement through ancient DNA sequencing.,"In this study, we screen archaeological soil samples by microscopy and analyse the samples by next generation sequencing to obtain results with parasites at species level and untargeted findings of plant and animal DNA. Three separate sediment layers of an ancient man-made pond in Hoby, Denmark, ranging from 100 BC to 200 AD, were analysed by microscopy for presence of intestinal worm eggs and DNA analysis were performed to identify intestinal worms and dietary components. Ancient DNA of parasites, domestic animals and edible plants revealed a change in use of the pond over time reflecting the household practice in the adjacent Iron Age settlement. The most abundant parasite found belonged to the Ascaris genus, which was not possible to type at species level. For all sediment layers the presence of eggs of the human whipworm Trichuris trichiura and the beef tapeworm Taenia saginata suggests continuous disposal of human faeces in the pond. Moreover, the continuous findings of T. saginata further imply beef consumption and may suggest that cattle were living in the immediate surrounding of the site throughout the period. Findings of additional host-specific parasites suggest fluctuating presence of other domestic animals over time: Trichuris suis (pig), Parascaris univalens (horse), Taenia hydatigena (dog and sheep). Likewise, alternating occurrence of aDNA of edible plants may suggest changes in agricultural practices. Moreover, the composition of aDNA of parasites, plants and vertebrates suggests a significant change in the use of the ancient pond over a period of three centuries."
2,"Salmonella serotypeTyphi, Shigella, and intestinal parasites among food handlers at Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia.","Food handlers play a major role in the transmission of Salmonella serotype Typhi (S. Typhi), Shigella, and intestinal parasites. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of S. Typhi, Shigella, and intestinal parasites among food handlers at Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2014. Stool samples from 410 food handlers were examined for bacterial pathogens and parasites. Pearson's Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used where appropriate.The prevalence of S. Typhi, Shigella, and intestinal parasites among food handlers was 11 (2.7%), 5 (1.2%), and 53 (12.9%), respectively. Among eight intestinal parasites identified, the two most prevalent intestinal parasites were hookworm 26 (6.3%) and G. lamblia 13 (3.1%). Male food handlers were more likely to be positive than were female food handlers for S. Typhi and intestinal parasites. Furthermore, food handlers who had a history of regular medical checkups were less infected with intestinal parasites. Being male (AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.4) and not attending medical checkups (AOR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4, 6.1) were independent predictors of intestinal parasitic infection in food handlers. Male food handlers were reluctant to have regular parasitological examinations.There was a high proportion of food handlers with S. Typhi, Shigella, and intestinal parasites in their faces. Special emphasis should be placed on S. Typhicarriers and male food handlers. Education and periodical medical checkups for intestinal parasites and S. Typhi should be considered as intervention measures."
2,Intestinal parasites and vector-borne pathogens in stray and free-roaming cats living in continental and insular Greece.,"This survey investigated the distribution of various intestinal parasites and vector-borne pathogens in stray and free-roaming cats living in four regions of Greece. A total number of one hundred and fifty cats living in three Islands (Crete, Mykonos and Skopelos) and in Athens municipality was established as a realistic aim to be accomplished in the study areas. All cats were examined with different microscopic, serological and molecular assays aiming at evaluating the occurrence of intestinal parasites, and exposure to or presence of vector-borne infections. A total of 135 cats (90%) was positive for one or more parasites and/or pathogens transmitted by ectoparasites. Forty-four (29.3%) cats were positive for one single infection, while 91 (60.7%) for more than one pathogen. A high number of (n. 53) multiple infections caused by feline intestinal and vector-borne agents including at least one zoonotic pathogen was detected. Among them, the most frequently recorded helminths were roundworms (Toxocara cati, 24%) and Dipylidium caninum (2%), while a high number of examined animals (58.8%) had seroreaction for Bartonella spp., followed by Rickettsia spp. (43.2%) and Leishmania infantum (6.1%). DNA-based assays revealed the zoonotic arthropod-borne organisms Bartonella henselae, Bartonella clarridgeiae, Rickettsia spp., and L. infantum. These results show that free-ranging cats living in areas of Greece under examination may be exposed to a plethora of internal parasites and vector-borne pathogens, some of them potentially able to infect humans. Therefore, epidemiological vigilance and appropriate control measures are crucial for the prevention and control of these infections and to minimize the risk of infection for people."
2,[(TO UPDATE ENFORCEMENT PRACTICE IN ENSURING THE PARASITIC SAFETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTS. LEGAL AND METHODOLOGICAL CONFLICTS: WAYS OF THEIR SOLUTION)].,"The modern development of parasitological science and practice is integrated into the process of legal regulation of the protection of human rights and health and the environment. Russian Federation Government Enactment No. 761 dated September 28; 2009, determines a provision on examining the legal acts establishing the sanitary and epidemiological requirements for their compliance with the standards, recommendations, and other documents of international organiza- tions, including the World Health Organization [10]. The authors carried out a detailed analysis ofthe status of law enforce- ment practice in ensuring the safety of water to be free from parasites, the most studied and proven in international and national law. Factorization of national statutes on safe drinking water and water in the water sources identified legal in- consistencies in both different legal acts of the Russian Federation and their compliance with the WHO recommendations [12]. Ways to overcome legal and methodological conflicts and those to provide mechanisis of legal regulation in this area were defined. It is noted that the decision is a complex process that involves various levels of a structure of legislative initiatives and the professional public; however,,the end result is focused on the dynamic integration of national law in ensuring the parasitic safety of the environment in the unified field of international law."
2,Lungworms and gastrointestinal parasites of domestic cats: a European perspective.,"With the exception of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, feline lungworms have been poorly studied. Information on their distribution is patchy and mostly limited to case reports. In this study, the occurrence of feline lungworms and co-infecting gastrointestinal parasites has been investigated in 12 European countries (i.e. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). An average of 10 domestic cats, with regular outdoor access, was sampled each month for 12months, and freshly passed faeces were collected. Stools were processed using a McMaster assay and a quantitative Baermann-Wetzel method. Animals positive for lungworms and/or gastrointestinal parasites were treated with a formulation containing fipronil, (S)-methoprene, eprinomectin, and praziquantel (Broadline??, Merial), and re-sampled 28days post-treatment. The association between lungworm infection and risk factors was analysed using statistical medians/means and the efficacy of the treatment against each lungworm species was assessed. Of 1990 cats sampled, 613 (30.8%) were positive for at least one parasite, while 210 (10.6%) were infected by lungworms. The prevalence of lungworm infection varied between the sampled sites, with the highest recorded in Bulgaria (35.8%) and the lowest in Switzerland (0.8%). None of the cats from Austria or the United Kingdom were infected by lungworms. Aelurostrongylus abstrusus was the species most frequently detected (78.1%), followed by Troglostrongylus brevior (19.5%), Eucoleus aerophilus (14.8%) and Oslerus rostratus (3.8%). The overall efficacy of the treatment was 99% for A. abstrusus and 100% for T. brevior, O. rostratus and E. aerophilus. Data presented provide a comprehensive account of the diagnosis, epidemiology and treatment of feline lungworms in Europe, as well as of the occurrence of co-infections by gastrointestinal parasites."
2,Integrating molecular and morphological approaches for characterizing parasite cryptic species: implications for parasitology.,"Herein we review theoretical and methodological considerations important for finding and delimiting cryptic species of parasites (species that are difficult to recognize using traditional systematic methods). Applications of molecular data in empirical investigations of cryptic species are discussed from an historical perspective, and we evaluate advantages and disadvantages of approaches that have been used to date. Developments concerning the theory and practice of species delimitation are emphasized because theory is critical to interpretation of data. The advantages and disadvantages of different molecular methodologies, including the number and kind of loci, are discussed relative to tree-based approaches for detecting and delimiting cryptic species. We conclude by discussing some implications that cryptic species have for research programmes in parasitology, emphasizing that careful attention to the theory and operational practices involved in finding, delimiting, and describing new species (including cryptic species) is essential, not only for fully characterizing parasite biodiversity and broader aspects of comparative biology such as systematics, evolution, ecology and biogeography, but to applied research efforts that strive to improve development and understanding of epidemiology, diagnostics, control and potential eradication of parasitic diseases."
2,Molecular testing for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations of intestinal parasitic infections.,"Over the past few decades, nucleic acid-based methods have been developed for the diagnosis of intestinal parasitic infections. Advantages of nucleic acid-based methods are numerous; typically, these include increased sensitivity and specificity and simpler standardization of diagnostic procedures. DNA samples can also be stored and used for genetic characterization and molecular typing, providing a valuable tool for surveys and surveillance studies. A variety of technologies have been applied, and some specific and general pitfalls and limitations have been identified. This review provides an overview of the multitude of methods that have been reported for the detection of intestinal parasites and offers some guidance in applying these methods in the clinical laboratory and in epidemiological studies."
2,A comparison of mini-FLOTAC and FLOTAC with classic methods to diagnosing intestinal parasites of dogs from Brazil.,"Dogs may be affected by different species of gastrointestinal parasites which present great importance in veterinary medicine and public health. Several techniques to diagnosing these parasites have been proposed, but different performances achieved by each method make difficult the choice of the best technique to be used. In this study, the performance of two classic methods (i.e., Willis and Hoffman techniques) and two recent techniques (i.e., FLOTAC and Mini-FLOTAC) to diagnosing gastrointestinal parasites of dogs was evaluated. Fecal samples (n = 127) of dogs divided in pools (n = 30) were collected and analyzed using four different techniques (see above). Eggs and/or oocysts of gastrointestinal parasites were detected in 93.3 % (28/30) of the samples. In particular, 20 % (6/30) were detected through the method of Hoffman, 53.3 % (16/30) by the Willis technique, and 63.3 % (19/30) and 90 % (27/30) by Mini-FLOTAC and FLOTAC, respectively. Ancylostomatidae, Trichuris vulpis and Toxocara canis were the most frequent parasites herein detected. The FLOTAC and Mini-FLOTAC techniques were the most efficient tools to detect eggs and/or oocysts of gastrointestinal parasites of dogs, therefore their use is recommended in the laboratorial routine of veterinary medicine. This study is the first report of the use of both techniques (i.e., FLOTAC and Mini-FLOTAC) to diagnosing parasites of dogs in Brazil."
2,Ecotoxicoparasitology of the gastrointestinal tracts of pinnipeds: the effect of parasites on the potential bioavailability of total mercury (THg).,"Acanthocephalans, cestodes, and some species of nematodes acquire nutrients from the lumen contents in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of their definitive host. These parasites are exposed to toxicants, such as mercury (Hg), through passive or active feeding mechanisms; therefore, the focus of this study was to determine if there is an effect of parasites on the dietary availability of total mercury (THg) within piscivorous pinniped hosts. THg concentrations ([THg]) in selected host tissues, parasites, and GI lumen contents from 22 California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), 15 ringed seals (Phoca hispida), and 4 spotted seals (Phoca largha) were determined. Among all pinnipeds, [THg] in acanthocephalans of the large intestine were significantly higher than concentrations in other samples (host lumen contents, other parasites and host intestinal wall), irrespective of location within the host GI tract. ??<sup>15</sup>N values of parasites depended both on parasite group and location within the GI tract. ??<sup>15</sup>N values were consistently higher in parasites inhabiting the large intestine, compared to elsewhere in the GI tract, for both sea lions and seals. ??<sup>13</sup>C values in parasites did not differ significantly from host GI tissues. Based on both [THg] and stable isotope values, parasites are likely affecting the Hg bioavailability within the GI lumen contents and host tissues, and toxicant-parasite interactions appear to depend on both parasitic taxon as well as their location within the host intestine."
2,Parasitic diversity found in coprolites of camelids during the Holocene.,"Knowledge of parasitic infections to which fauna was exposed in the past provides information on the geographical origin of some parasites, on the possible dispersal routes and for archaeological fauna on the potential zoonotic risk that human and animal populations could be exposed. The aim of the present study was to examine the gastrointestinal parasite present in camelid coprolites collected from the archaeological site Cerro Casa de Piedra, cave 7 (CCP7), Patagonia, Argentina. Coprolites were collected from different stratified sequences dating from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition to the late Holocene. Paleoparasitological examination revealed the presence of eggs of Trichostrongylidae attributed to Lamanema chavezi or Nematodirus lamae, eggs of three unidentified capillariids, Strongylus-type eggs and oocysts of Eimeria macusaniensis. These parasites affected camelids living in the studied area since the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, about 10,000??years ago. Gastrointestinal parasite fauna of patagonian camelids did not vary significatively from Pleistocene-Holocene transition to late Holocene, although environmental conditions fluctuated greatly throughout this period, as indicative of the strength and the stability of these associations over time. In this study, the zoonotic and biogeography importance of parasites of camelids are also discussed. "
2,"[Metazoan parasites of Micropterus salmoides (Centrarchidae: Perciformes) from reservoirs of Nuevo Le??n, M??xico and their association with condition factor and gender].","The largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides is a very valuable fish species for aquaculture and sport fishing; however, there are no
systematic studies on fish metazoan parasites in Mexico. The main objective of the present study was to describe
the prevalence, abundance, and intensity of M. salmoides metazoan parasites, and their association with fish
condition factor and gender. The sample size was composed by 672 hosts, collected between 2011-2013 from the
following reservoirs of Nuevo Leon, M??xico: Rodrigo G??mez dam (?€?La Boca?€?, LB), Cuchillo-Solidaridad dam
(CS), Salinillas lagoon (LS), Mariano Escobedo dam (?€?Sombreretillo?€?, S), and Jos?? L??pez Portillo dam (?€?Cerro
Prieto?€?, CP). Living fish were transported to the laboratory; sizes and weights were then recorded to calculate
the Fulton condition factor (k). If possible, gender was also recorded. Parasites were detected under stereoscopy,
recollected and preserved by traditional techniques. Statistical analysis of association between parasitic load,
gender, and Fulton condition factor were calculated, using the X2 and the Student-t tests. Results showed that 12
different metazoans were identified, two flukes (Posthodiplostomum minimum centrarchi and Phyllodistomum
pearsei), one tapeworm (Proteocephalus ambloplitis), three roundworms (Contracaecum sp., Spinitectus
carolini and Philometra nodulosa), two acantocephalan (Neoechinorhynchus cylindratus and Arhythmorhynchus
sp.), one leech (Myzobdella moorei), and three copepods (Ergasilus versicolor; Ergasilus arthrosis and Ergasilus
cerastes). HSD Tukey test showed that infected fish from LB were significantly different than LS, CS, CP,
and S (P<0.05). Parasites most commonly collected in all five locations were P. m. centrarchi, Contracaecum
sp. and E. versicolor. The frequency of P. m. centrarchi was highly significant (P<0.001) than other parasites;
furthermore, this parasite showed the highest prevalence (97.5 %), abundance (10.12-83.6), and intensity
(15.44-88.5). Statistical dependence was found between intensity and abundance of metazoans with regard to
female gender and size on five reservoirs (t=143.82, P=0.0001; t=2.6, P=0.01, respectively). In addition, the
abundance and intensity showed statistical dependence with regard to k, which was proportionally significant.
New locality records for Nuevo Leon include P. m. centrarchi, P. pearsei, P. ambloplitis, Contracaecum sp.,
Arhythmorhynchus sp., and E. cerastes. Furthermore, P. nodulosa, S. carolini, N. cylindratus, and E. arthrosis
were new records for Mexico."
2,"MALDI-TOF MS in clinical parasitology: applications, constraints and prospects.","Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is currently being used for rapid and reproducible identification of bacteria, viruses and fungi in clinical microbiological laboratories. However, some studies have also reported the use of MALDI-TOF MS for identification of parasites, like Leishmania, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba, ticks and fleas. The present review collates all the information available on the use of this technique for parasites, in an effort to assess its applicability and the constraints for identification/diagnosis of parasites and diseases caused by them. Though MALDI-TOF MS-based identification of parasites is currently done by reference laboratories only, in future, this promising technology might surely replace/augment molecular methods in clinical parasitology laboratories."
2,"The bigger, the better? Volume measurements of parasites and hosts: Parasitic barnacles (Cirripedia, Rhizocephala) and their decapod hosts.","Rhizocephala, a group of parasitic castrators of other crustaceans, shows remarkable morphological adaptations to their lifestyle. The adult female parasite consists of a body that can be differentiated into two distinct regions: a sac-like structure containing the reproductive organs (the externa), and a trophic, root like system situated inside the hosts body (the interna). Parasitism results in the castration of their hosts, achieved by absorbing the entire reproductive energy of the host. Thus, the ratio of the host and parasite sizes is crucial for the understanding of the parasite's energetic cost. Using advanced imaging methods (micro-CT in conjunction with 3D modeling), we measured the volume of parasitic structures (externa, interna, egg mass, egg number, visceral mass) and the volume of the entire host. Our results show positive correlations between the volume of (1) entire rhizocephalan (externa + interna) and host body, (2) rhizocephalan externa and host body, (3) rhizocephalan visceral mass and rhizocephalan body, (4) egg mass and rhizocephalan externa, (5) rhizocephalan egg mass and their egg number. Comparing the rhizocephalan Sylon hippolytes, a parasite of caridean shrimps, and representatives of Peltogaster, parasites of hermit crabs, we could match their different traits on a reconstructed relationship. With this study we add new and significant information to our global understanding of the evolution of parasitic castrators, of interactions between a parasitic castrator and its host and of different parasitic strategies within parasitic castrators exemplified by rhizocephalans."
2,Global food security: the impact of veterinary parasites and parasitologists.,"Global food security will require the production of more food using resources including land more efficiently, and with less waste. This goal must be achieved within the context of climate change and while ensuring minimal adverse environmental impact from both crop and livestock production. Disease, especially infectious disease, is a main constraint of biologically efficient livestock production and both endemic and exotic disease results in mortality and morbidity and hence less food than should ideally be available in current farming systems. A significant proportion of diseases affect the safety of food supplies, in addition to or instead of, their effect on volume and quality of food products. Parasitological diseases including those caused by nematodes, trematodes, protozoa and ectoparasites, have widely differing effects on meat, milk and fibre production and many new technologies have been developed in order to prevent or treat them. Approaches to developing better control of parasites have included livestock breeding strategies, improved nutrition and management, and the development of new drugs, diagnostic tests and vaccines. Some of the most important examples include both the development of new anthelmintic products, and better means of using existing drugs in order to maximise their effectiveness in the face of rapidly increasing parasite resistance; diagnostic tests which are able to detect low levels of nucleic acids or proteins from infectious agents rapidly; and vaccines derived from either native or recombinant proteins and designed to stimulate the most appropriate protective response from livestock species. Some of the parasitic diseases affect restricted regions around the world, however most affect very large global populations. The development of technologies of suitable and affordable livestock products for use in developing countries where most pressure on increased production for food will occur, provides a particular challenge. Most if not all new technologies form part of integrated management schemes on farms and these vary hugely in differing systems and geographical regions of the world. If the benefit of improved technologies for optimal health, welfare and biological efficiency of livestock is to be realised, then the veterinary, farming, commercial animal health and public service communities need to learn lessons from past successes and failures in the delivery of newly developed technologies to the farmer. The combination of technology and rural development in the veterinary parasitological field has played a key role in current food production and is well placed to continue this trend to help in ensuring future food requirements for the world.

2,Understanding the Loss of Maternal Care in Avian Brood Parasites Using Preoptic Area Transcriptome Comparisons in Brood Parasitic and Non-parasitic Blackbirds.,"Parental care is critical for offspring survival in many species. However, parental behaviors have been lost in roughly 1% of avian species known as the obligate brood parasites. To shed light on molecular and neurobiological mechanisms mediating brood parasitic behavior, we compared brain gene expression patterns between two brood parasitic species and one closely related non-parasitic Icterid (blackbird) species. Our analyses focused on gene expression changes specifically in the preoptic area (POA), a brain region known to play a critical role in parental behavior across vertebrates. Using comparative transcriptomic approaches, we identified gene expression patterns associated with brood parasitism. We evaluated three non-mutually exclusive alternatives for the evolution of brood parasitism: (1) retention of juvenile-like (neotenic) gene expression, (2) reduced expression of maternal care-related genes in the POA, and/or (3) increased expression of genes inhibiting maternal care. We find evidence for neotenic expression patterns in both species of parasitic cowbirds as compared to maternal, non-parasites. In addition, we observed differential expression in a number of genes with previously established roles in mediating maternal care. Together, these results provide the first insight into transcriptomic and genetic mechanisms underlying the loss of maternal behavior in avian brood parasites."
2,"Intestinal parasites of owned dogs and cats from metropolitan and micropolitan areas: prevalence, zoonotic risks, and pet owner awareness in northern Italy.","Intestinal parasites of dogs and cats are cosmopolitan pathogens with zoonotic potential for humans. Our investigation considered their diffusion in dogs and cats from northern Italy areas, specifically the metropolitan area of Milan and two micropolitan areas of neighboring provinces. It included the study of the level of awareness in pet owners of the zoonotic potential from these parasites. A total of 409 fresh fecal samples were collected from household dogs and cats for copromicroscopic analysis and detection of Giardia duodenalis coproantigens. The assemblages of Giardia were also identified. A questionnaire about intestinal parasites biology and zoonotic potential was submitted to 185 pet owners. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites resulted higher in cats (47.37%-60.42%) and dogs (57.41%-43.02%) from micropolitan areas than that from the metropolis of Milan (dogs: P = 28.16%; cats: P = 32.58 %). The zoonotic parasites infecting pets under investigation were T. canis and T. cati, T. vulpis, Ancylostomatidae, and G. duodenalis assemblage A. Only 49.19% of pet owners showed to be aware of the risks for human health from canine and feline intestinal parasites. Parasitological results in pets and awareness determination in their owners clearly highlight how the role of veterinarians is important in indicating correct and widespread behaviors to reduce risks of infection for pets and humans in urban areas. "
2,"Host-symbiont-pathogen interactions in blood-feeding parasites: nutrition, immune cross-talk and gene exchange.","Animals are common hosts of mutualistic, commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. Blood-feeding parasites feed on a diet that is nutritionally unbalanced and thus often rely on symbionts to supplement essential nutrients. However, they are also of medical importance as they can be infected by pathogens such as bacteria, protists or viruses that take advantage of the blood-feeding nutritional strategy for own transmission. Since blood-feeding evolved multiple times independently in diverse animals, it showcases a gradient of host-microbe interactions. While some parasitic lineages are possibly asymbiotic and manage to supplement their diet from other food sources, other lineages are either loosely associated with extracellular gut symbionts or harbour intracellular obligate symbionts that are essential for the host development and reproduction. What is perhaps even more diverse are the pathogenic lineages that infect blood-feeding parasites. This microbial diversity not only puts the host into a complicated situation - distinguishing between microorganisms that can greatly decrease or increase its fitness - but also increases opportunity for horizontal gene transfer to occur in this environment. In this review, I first introduce this diversity of mutualistic and pathogenic microorganisms associated with blood-feeding animals and then focus on patterns in their interactions, particularly nutrition, immune cross-talk and gene exchange."
2,Paleoparasitology: the origin of human parasites.,"Parasitism is composed by three subsystems: the parasite, the host, and the environment. There are no organisms that cannot be parasitized. The relationship between a parasite and its host species most of the time do not result in damage or disease to the host. However, in a parasitic disease the presence of a given parasite is always necessary, at least in a given moment of the infection. Some parasite species that infect humans were inherited from pre-hominids, and were shared with other phylogenetically close host species, but other parasite species were acquired from the environment as humans evolved. Human migration spread inherited parasites throughout the globe. To recover and trace the origin and evolution of infectious diseases, paleoparasitology was created. Paleoparasitology is the study of parasites in ancient material, which provided new information on the evolution, paleoepidemiology, ecology and phylogenetics of infectious diseases. "
2,Veterinary parasitology teaching - Ten years of experience with the Vetsuisse curriculum.,"Pursuant to the Joint Declaration by 29 European education ministers in June 1999 in the city of Bologna, Italy, the so-called 'Bologna Process' was officially introduced at the Vetsuisse Faculty (Universities of Zurich and Berne) in Switzerland in 2007. The long-term goal of restructuring the study programmes was to create a common European Higher Education Area (EHEA), with uniform and clearly defined standards for degrees (""diplomas""). Accordingly, the Vetsuisse curriculum was organised as a 3-year Bachelor and a 2-year Master study program. For the final Federal examination in veterinary medicine, both programs and a master thesis have to be completed. Parasitology, as a subject, is introduced with selected examples in the ecology course during the first academic year. The second and third years of the Bachelor program comprise non-organ-centred (NOC) and integrated organ-centred (OC) course modules, respectively. In the NOC modules, parasitology is taught in consecutive courses, focussing on topics including occurrence, biology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostics and the strategic principles of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions against major veterinary and zoonotic parasites. This syllabus is complemented with live demonstrations as well as practical laboratory exercises. Lecture notes, with defined learning objectives, are based on the textbook ""Parasitology in Veterinary Medicine"" which is available free of charge to students as an on-line edition in German. Furthermore, students review relevant parasitoses in the diagnostic context of OC case presentations. In another module, immunological aspects of parasitic diseases are elaborated on group sessions, supported through the use of specialist literature. The two-year Master program is divided into a core syllabus for all students, and elective subjects are chosen from six areas of specialisation (three each with clinical or non-clinical focus). Within the clinically focused specialisations, interactive teaching of control strategies against parasitoses of companion and farm animals is the focus. Students specialising in 'Pathobiology' experience a deep immersion in parasitology. Learning objectives are verified in different test formats. E-learning tools, including a learning management on-line platform, allow interactive student training in coproscopic diagnostic techniques and in arachno-entomology and provide case-oriented teaching. Since an aptitude test limits the number of first-year students in veterinary medicine in Switzerland (80 in Z??rich, 70 in Berne), the conditions for students and teachers are similar each year. The fragmentation of teaching in veterinary parasitology, the reduction of the number of diagnostic exercises and clinically oriented day-1-skills pertaining to the control of parasitoses are critically commented upon."
2,Parasites in Forensic Science: a historic perspective,"Parasites show a great potential to Forensic Science. Forensic Science is the application of any science and methodology to the legal system. The forensic scientist collects and analyses the physical evidence and produce a report of the results to the court. A parasite is an organism that lives at the expense of another and they exist in any ecosystem. Parasites are the cause of many important diseases. The forensic scientists can use the parasites to identify a crime scene, to determine the murder weapon or simply identify an individual. The applications for parasites in the Forensic Science can be many and more studies should be made in Forensic Parasitology. The most important parasites in Forensic Science are helminths specifically schistosomes. Through history there are many cases where schistosomes were described in autopsies and it was related to the cause of death. Here we review the applications of parasites in Forensic Science and its importance to the forensic scientist."
2,Life in a rock pool: Radiation and population genetics of myxozoan parasites in hosts inhabiting restricted spaces.,"Intertidal rock pools where fish and invertebrates are in constant close contact due to limited space and water level fluctuations represent ideal conditions to promote life cycles in parasites using these two alternate hosts and to study speciation processes that could contribute to understanding the roles of parasitic species in such ecosystems.Gall bladder and liver samples from five clinid fish species (Blenniiformes: Clinidae) were morphologically and molecularly examined to determine the diversity, prevalence, distribution and host specificity of Ceratomyxa parasites (Cnidaria: Myxozoa) in intertidal habitats along the coast of South Africa. Phylogenetic relationships of clinid ceratomyxids based on the SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA and ITS regions were assessed additionally to the investigation of population genetic structure of Ceratomyxa cottoidii and subsequent comparison with the data known from type fish host Clinus cottoides.Seven Ceratomyxa species including previously described Ceratomyxa dehoopi and C. cottoidii were recognized in clinids. They represent a diverse group of rapidly evolving, closely related species with a remarkably high prevalence in their hosts, little host specificity and frequent concurrent infections, most probably as a result of parasite radiation after multiple speciation events triggered by limited host dispersal within restricted spaces. C. cottoidii represents the most common clinid parasite with a population structure characterized by young expanding populations in the south west and south east coast and by older populations in equilibrium on the west coast of its distribution. Parasite and fish host population structures show overlapping patterns and are very likely affected by similar oceanographic barriers possibly due to reduced host dispersal enhancing parasite community differentiation. While fish host specificity had little impact on parasite population structure, the habitat preference of the alternate invertebrate host as well as tidal water exchange may be additional crucial variables affecting the dispersal and associated population structure of C. cottoidii."
2,"Geographical distribution of protozoan and metazoan parasites of farmed Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.) (Perciformes: Cichlidae) in Yucat??n, M??xico.","In Yucat??n State, southern M??xico, as in many other parts of the world where tilapia has been introduced for aquaculture, the deficient application of management measures has led to the establishment of non-native parasites. The aims of this study were to describe the geographical distribution of protozoan and helminth parasites of farmed Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.) throughout the Yucat??n and to examine the potential statistical associations of the prevalence and mean abundance of these parasites with management and environmental variables.All 29 Nile tilapia farms currently operating in Yucat??n were surveyed. Maps were created to describe the geographical location of the parasites infecting Nile tilapia at each farm. We evaluated the statistical associations of management and environmental variables with the mean abundance values of each parasite species using a multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA) and generalized additive models (GAM). We also used Ripley's??K to determine whether there were significant clusters of the mean abundance of particular parasite species in specific regions of the Yucat??n State.A total of 580 O. niloticus were examined, and 11 species of parasites were recorded. Cichlidogyrus sclerosus was the most frequent and abundant parasite at all 29 farms, whereas Gyrodactylus cichlidarum was found in 26 of the 29 farms. The RDA showed that the most important predictors were the concentration of nitrites and ammonium and the water exchange rate. The GAM showed the significant effect of the tank capacity, no use of quarantine area and no use of prophylactic treatments on the mean abundance of G. cichlidarum. The geographical distribution patterns of the mean abundance of most parasite species exhibited clustering near to the coast of Yucat??n.Two groups of farms were distinguished: (i) farms with medium to high technology, where the most frequent and abundant parasite was G. cichlidarum, and (ii) farms with low technology, where the most frequent and abundant parasite was C. sclerosus. Good biosecurity practices such as the use of quarantine and prophylactic treatments prior to the introduction of infected Nile tilapia to the farms are recommended to avoid the establishment of parasites such as G. cichlidarum in farms."
2,"Prevalence and predictors of intestinal parasites among food handlers in Yebu Town, southwest Ethiopia.","As a result of urbanization, eating and drinking from food service establishments is becoming a common practice in developing countries like Ethiopia, which increases the chances of food borne diseases. The health status and hygiene practices of food handlers are the major determinants of food contamination. In developing countries where there are poor regulatory systems for food hygiene, food handlers are often appointed without screening for possible infections associated with poor hygiene like intestinal parasites.This study aimed at determining the prevalence and predictors of intestinal parasites and assessing the hygiene practices among food handlers in Yebu Town, southwest Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted among a total of 118 food handlers in Yebu Town in January 2011. Fresh stool specimens were collected and processed using both direct wet mount and Formol ether concentration techniques.The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites among the study subjects was 44.1% (52/118). Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm spp were the predominant parasites identified from the stool of study participants. Age above 35 years (AOR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 21.8), no regular practice of washing hands before a meal (AOR: 7.8, 95% CI: 2.8, 24.8), and untrimmed finger nail (AOR: 14.7, 95% CI: 2.8, 75.4) were independent predictors of intestinal parasitic infection among the food handlers.The present study showed high prevalence of intestinal parasites among the study subjects. The study also revealed poor personal hygiene like poor practice of hand washing and poor finger nail hygiene. Therefore, much has to be done to improve the personal hygiene of the food handlers. Pre-placement and periodic screening of food handlers for parasites and prompt treatment, and health education on regular trimming or cleaning of fingernails would be the way forward for prevention of food borne diseases."
2,The diversity of tick-borne bacteria and parasites in ticks collected from the Strandja Nature Park in south-eastern Bulgaria.,"Ticks are important carriers of many different zoonotic pathogens. To date, there are many studies about ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBP), but only a few were carried out in Bulgaria. The present study intends to detect the prevalence of tick-borne bacteria and parasites occurring at the Black Sea in Bulgaria to evaluate the zoonotic potential of the tick-borne pathogens transmitted by ticks in this area.In total, cDNA from 1541 ticks (Dermacentor spp., Haemaphysalis spp., Hyalomma spp., Ixodes spp. and Rhipicephalus spp.) collected in Bulgaria by flagging method or from hosts was tested in pools of ten individuals each for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.), Rickettsia spp. and ""Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis"" via conventional and quantitative real-time PCR. Subsequently, samples from positive pools were tested individually and a randomized selection of positive PCR samples was purified, sequenced, and analyzed.Altogether, 23.2% of ticks were infected with at least one of the tested pathogens. The highest infection levels were noted in nymphs (32.3%) and females (27.5%). Very high prevalence was detected for Rickettsia spp. (48.3%), followed by A. phagocytophilum (6.2%), Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.) (1.7%), Babesia spp. (0.4%) and ""Ca. Neoehrlichia mikurensis"" (0.1%). Co-infections were found in 2.5% of the tested ticks (mainly Ixodes spp.). Sequencing revealed the presence of Rickettsia monacensis, R. helvetica, and R. aeschlimannii, Babesia microti and B. caballi, and Theileria buffeli and Borrelia afzelli.This study shows very high prevalence of zoonotic Rickettsia spp. in ticks from Bulgaria and moderate to low prevalence for all other pathogens tested. One should take into account that tick bites from this area could lead to Rickettsia infection in humans and mammals."
2,Human parasitology worldwide research.,"In this article, the trends in human parasitology have been studied through the analysis of the number of publications in this area. The parameters studied were: number of articles, language, countries and institutions with the highest number of publications, and keywords with greater presence in the articles of human parasitology. The results of the analysis confirm the growing interest in this area, observing an exponential growth in the number of publications in the last decades. We also verified that the main country in terms of scientific production is the USA, although among the most important institutions, we find non-US centres such as the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. For observing the relative importance of the journals that publish articles in this specific topic, an index has been created based on the h-index of the journal with publications related to human parasitology and divided by every 100 items. This rank is led fist by 'Journal of Medical Entomology' closely followed by 'Parasitology'. The analysis of the keywords allows to draw conclusions about the great importance of malaria in the current world research. A change in analytical methodology is also observed, and molecular techniques are now being imposed. These techniques, in the near future, have to influence in an improvement in the treatments and prevention of the diseases caused by parasites. Finally, it can be seen that diseases traditionally studied as helminthiasis and amebiasis are currently as well studied as others such as toxoplasmosis or leishmaniasis."
2,Coccidian parasites of fish encompass profound phylogenetic diversity and gave rise to each of the major parasitic groups in terrestrial vertebrates.,"Fish are the oldest and most diverse group of vertebrates; it therefore stands to reason that fish may have been the original hosts for many types of extant vertebrate parasites. Here, we sought to determine whether coccidian parasites of fish are especially diverse. We therefore sampled such parasites from thirty-nine species of fish and tested phylogenetic hypotheses concerning their relationships, using 18S rDNA. We found compelling phylogenetic support for distinctions among at least four lineages of piscine parasites presently ascribed to the genus Goussia. Some, but not all parasites attributed to Eimeria were confirmed as such. Major taxonomic revisions are likely justified for these parasites of fish, which appear to have given rise to each of the major lineages of coccidian parasites that subsequently proliferated in terrestrial vertebrates, including those such as Toxoplasma gondii that form tissue cysts in intermediate hosts."
2,Muller's Ratchet and Ribosome Degeneration in the Obligate Intracellular Parasites <i>Microsporidia</i>.,"<i>Microsporidia</i> are fungi-like parasites that have the smallest known eukaryotic genome, and for that reason they are used as a model to study the phenomenon of genome decay in parasitic forms of life. Similar to other intracellular parasites that reproduce asexually in an environment with alleviated natural selection, <i>Microsporidia</i> experience continuous genome decay that is driven by Muller's ratchet-an evolutionary process of irreversible accumulation of deleterious mutations that lead to gene loss and the miniaturization of cellular components. Particularly, <i>Microsporidia</i> have remarkably small ribosomes in which the rRNA is reduced to the minimal enzymatic core. In this study, we analyzed microsporidian ribosomes to study an apparent impact of Muller's ratchet on structure of RNA and protein molecules in parasitic forms of life. Through mass spectrometry of microsporidian proteome and analysis of microsporidian genomes, we found that massive rRNA reduction in microsporidian ribosomes appears to annihilate the binding sites for ribosomal proteins eL8, eL27, and eS31, suggesting that these proteins are no longer bound to the ribosome in microsporidian species. We then provided an evidence that protein eS31 is retained in <i>Microsporidia</i> due to its non-ribosomal function in ubiquitin biogenesis. Our study illustrates that, while <i>Microsporidia</i> carry the same set of ribosomal proteins as non-parasitic eukaryotes, some ribosomal proteins are no longer participating in protein synthesis in <i>Microsporidia</i> and they are preserved from genome decay by having extra-ribosomal functions. More generally, our study shows that many components of parasitic cells, which are identified by automated annotation of pathogenic genomes, may lack part of their biological functions due to continuous genome decay."
2,"Distribution of intestinal parasitic infections amongst aborigine children at Post Sungai Rual, Kelantan, Malaysia.","Intestinal parasitic infections are important public health problems among underprivileged communities. This study was carried out to evaluate the infection rate of intestinal parasites among aborigine children at Pos Sungai Rual, Kelantan, Malaysia. A total of 111 faecal samples from aborigine children aged 4-12 years were screened for intestinal parasites by direct smear technique. Harada-Mori culture was also performed to identify hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis larvae. The results showed that 87.4% of the children examined were positive for one or more parasites. Intestinal parasites were significantly lower in boys (78.7%) as compared to girls (93.8%). The infection occurred in very young children aged 4-6 years (80.0%) and the percentage of parasite-positive cases appeared to be significantly higher (92.9%) among the children aged 7-9 years. Trichuris trichiura was the most common parasite found in aborigine children (65.8%). Low socioeconomic status, poor environmental sanitation and poor personal hygiene are possible contributing factors that increase the rate of intestinal parasitic infections among the children. Thus, the parasitic diseases will continue to threaten the people's health especially among communities from rural areas if no appropriate actions are taken to diminish the transmission of the parasites.

2,Infection levels of gastrointestinal parasites in sheep and goats in Papua New Guinea.,"Gastrointestinal parasites of livestock cause diseases of important socio-economic concern worldwide. The present study investigated the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in sheep and goats in lowland and highland regions of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Faecal samples were collected from a total of 165 small ruminants (110 sheep and 55 goats) from February to April 2011. Analysis by a modified McMaster technique revealed that 128 animals (72% of sheep and 89% of goats) were infected with one or more species of gastrointestinal parasites. The gastrointestinal parasites found and their prevalences in sheep (S) and in goats (G) were as follows: strongyle 67.3% (S), 85.5% (G); Eimeria 17.3% (S), 16.4% (G); Strongyloides, 8.2% (S), 23.6% (G); Fasciola, 5.5% (S), 18.2% (G); Trichuris, 1.8% (S), 3.6% (G); and Nematodirus, 1.8% (S), 3.6% (G). Two additional genera were found in goats: Moniezia (9.1%) and Dictocaulus (3.6%). This is the first study to quantitatively examine the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in goats in PNG. The high rates of parasitism observed in the present study are likely to be associated with poor farming management practices, including lack of pasture recovery time, lack of parasite control measures and poor-quality feed.

2,"Parasites infecting the cultured oyster Crassostrea gasar (Adanson, 1757) in Northeast Brazil.","The oyster Crassostrea gasar is a species widely used as food and a source of income for the local population of the estuaries of Northeast Brazil. Perkinsus marinus and Perkinsus olseni are deleterious parasites for oyster farming and were recently detected in Brazil. In this study, a histopathologic survey of the oyster C. gasar cultured in the estuary of the River Mamanguape (Para??ba State) was performed. Adult oysters were collected in December 2011 and March, May, August and October 2012 and processed for histology and Perkinsus sp. identification by molecular analyses. Histopathological analysis revealed the presence of parasitic organisms including viral gametocytic hypertrophy, prokaryote-like colonies, protozoans (Perkinsus sp. and Nematopsis sp.) and metazoans (Tylocephalum sp. and cestodes). Other commensal organisms were also detected (the protozoan Ancistrocoma sp. and the turbellarian Urastoma sp.). The protozoan parasite Perkinsus sp. had the highest overall prevalence among the symbiotic organisms studied (48.9%), followed by Nematopsis sp. (36.3%). The other organisms were only sporadically observed. Only the protozoan Perkinsus sp. caused alterations in the oysters' infected organs. Molecular analyses confirmed the presence of P. marinus, P. olseni and Perkinsus beihaiensis infecting the oyster C. gasar. This is the first report of P. beihaiensis in this oyster species."
2,Parasites of freshwater fishes in North America: why so neglected?,"Fish parasitology has a long tradition in North America and numerous parasitologists have contributed considerably to the current knowledge of the diversity and biology of protistan and metazoan parasites of freshwater fishes. The Journal of Parasitology has been essential in disseminating this knowledge and remains a significant contributor to our understanding of fish parasites in North America as well as more broadly at the international level. However, with a few exceptions, the importance of fish parasites has decreased during the last decades, which is reflected in the considerable decline of funding and corresponding decrease of attention paid to these parasites in Canada and the United States of America. After the 'golden age' in the second half of the 20th Century, fish parasitology in Canada and the United States went in a new direction, driven by technology and a shift in priorities. In contrast, fish parasitology in Mexico has undergone rapid development since the early 1990s, partly due to extensive international collaboration and governmental funding. A critical review of the current data on the parasites of freshwater fishes in North America has revealed considerable gaps in the knowledge of their species composition, host specificity, life cycles, evolution, phylogeography, and relationships with their fish hosts. As to the key question, ""Why so neglected?"" this is probably because: (1) fish parasites are not in the forefront due to their lesser economic importance; (2) there is little funding for this kind of research, especially if a practical application is not immediately apparent; and (3) of shifting interests and a shortage of key personalities to train a new generation (they switched to marine habitats or other fields). Some of the opportunities for future research are outlined, such as climate change and cryptic species diversity. A significant problem challenging future research seems to be the loss of trained and experienced fish parasitologists. This has 2 major ramifications: the loss of expertise in identifying organisms that other biologists (e.g., ecologists, molecular biologists, evolutionists) work with, and an incomplete comprehension of ecosystem structure and function in the face of climate change, emerging diseases, and loss of biodiversity."
2,Mechanisms of CNS invasion and damage by parasites.,"Invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) is a most devastating complication of a parasitic infection. Several physical and immunological barriers provide obstacles to such an invasion. In this broad overview focus is given to the physical barriers to neuroinvasion of parasites provided at the portal of entry of the parasites, i.e., the skin and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and between the blood and the brain parenchyma, i.e., the blood-brain barrier (BBB). A description is given on how human pathogenic parasites can reach the CNS via the bloodstream either as free-living or extracellular parasites, by embolization of eggs, or within red or white blood cells when adapted to intracellular life. Molecular mechanisms are discussed by which parasites can interact with or pass across the BBB. The possible targeting of the circumventricular organs by parasites, as well as the parasites' direct entry to the brain from the nasal cavity through the olfactory nerve pathway, is also highlighted. Finally, examples are given which illustrate different mechanisms by which parasites can cause dysfunction or damage in the CNS related to toxic effects of parasite-derived molecules or to immune responses to the infection. "
2,Clinical and Analytical Evaluation of a Single-Vial Stool Collection Device with Formalin-Free Fixative for Improved Processing and Comprehensive Detection of Gastrointestinal Parasites.,"Microscopic examination of feces is a standard laboratory method for diagnosing gastrointestinal parasite infections. In North America, the ovum and parasite (O&P) examination is typically performed using stool that is chemically fixed in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and formalin, after which the stool is concentrated by filtration to enhance sensitivity. Mini Parasep solvent-free (SF) tubes allow collection and concentration within a single collection vial. The goal of the study was to determine whether consolidated processing and concentration with the Parasep tubes using an alcohol-based fixative (Alcorfix) provide O&P examinations equivalent to or better than those done by processing of PVA-formalin-fixed stool using a SpinCon concentration device. Parasep tubes revealed filtration performance equivalent to that of the SpinCon concentration device using PVA-formalin-fixed stool containing protozoa. Specimens cocollected in Parasep tubes containing PVA-formalin and Alcorfix revealed comparable morphology and staining for various protozoa. Alcorfix effectively fixed live Cryptosporidium and microsporidia such that morphology and staining were conserved for modified acid-fast and modified trichrome stains. A work flow analysis revealed significant time savings for batches of 10 or 30 O&P specimens in tubes with Alcorfix compared to the amount of time that it took to analyze the same number of specimens in tubes with PVA-formalin. The direct hands-on time savings with Mini Parasep tubes were 17 min and 41 s and 32 min and 1 s for batches of 10 and 30 specimens, respectively. Parasep tubes containing Alcorfix provide significant work flow advantages to laboratories that process medium to high volumes of O&P specimens by streamlining processing and converting to a single tube. These improvements in work flow, reduction of the amount of formalin used in the laboratory, and equivalent microscopy results are attractive advancements in O&P testing for North American diagnostic parasitology laboratories.

2,"Intestinal parasitic infections among expatriate workers in various occupations in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.","Intestinal parasitic infections are prevalent throughout many countries. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasite carriers among 21,347 expatriate workers, including food handlers and housemaids attending the public health center laboratory in Sharjah, UAE. Stool sample collection was performed throughout the period between January and December 2013. All samples were examined microscopically. Demographic data were also obtained and analyzed. Intestinal parasites were found in 3.3% (708/21,347) of the studied samples (single and multiple infections). Among positive samples, six hundred and eighty-three samples (96.5%) were positive for a single parasite: Giardia lamblia (257; 36.3%) and Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar (220; 31.1%), respectively, whereas mono-infections with helminths accounted for 206 (29.1%) of the samples. Infection rates with single worms were: Ascaris lumbricoides (84; 11.9%), Hookworm (34; 4.8%), Trichuris trichiura (33; 4.7%), Taenia spp. (27; 3.81%), Strongyloides stercoralis (13; 1.8%), Hymenolepis nana (13; 1.8%), and Enterobius vermicularis (2; 0.28%), respectively. Infections were significantly associated with gender (x2 = 14.18; p = 0.002) with males as the most commonly infected with both groups of intestinal parasites (protozoa and helminths). A strong statistical association was noted correlating the parasite occurrence with certain nationalities (x2= 49.5, p <0.001). Furthermore, the study has also found a strong statistical correlation between parasite occurrence and occupation (x2= 15.60; p = 0.029). Multiple infections were not common (3.5% of the positive samples), although one individual (0.14%) had four helminth species, concurrently. These findings emphasized that food handlers with different pathogenic parasitic organisms may pose a significant health risk to the public."
2,Identification of human intestinal parasites affecting an asymptomatic peri-urban Argentinian population using multi-parallel quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.,"In resource-limited countries, stool microscopy is the diagnostic test of choice for intestinal parasites (soil-transmitted helminths and/or intestinal protozoa). However, sensitivity and specificity is low. Improved diagnosis of intestinal parasites is especially important for accurate measurements of prevalence and intensity of infections in endemic areas.The study was carried out in Or??n, Argentina. A total of 99 stool samples from a local surveillance campaign were analyzed by concentration microscopy and McMaster egg counting technique compared to the analysis by multi-parallel quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). This study compared the performance of qPCR assay and stool microscopy for 8 common intestinal parasites that infect humans including the helminths Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura, and the protozoa Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, and Entamoeba histolytica, and investigated the prevalence of polyparasitism in an endemic area.qPCR showed higher detection rates for all parasites as compared to stool microscopy except T. trichiura. Species-specific primers and probes were able to distinguish between A. duodenale (19.1%) and N. americanus (36.4%) infections. There were 48.6% of subjects co-infected with both hookworms, and a significant increase in hookworm DNA for A. duodenale versus N. americanus (119.6 fg/??L: 0.63 fg/??L, P?€?<?€?0.001) respectively. qPCR outperformed microscopy by the largest margin in G. lamblia infections (63.6% versus 8.1%, P?€?<?€?0.05). Polyparasitism was detected more often by qPCR compared to microscopy (64.7% versus 24.2%, P?€?<?€?0.05).Multi-parallel qPCR is a quantitative molecular diagnostic method for common intestinal parasites in an endemic area that has improved diagnostic accuracy compared to stool microscopy. This first time use of multi-parallel qPCR in Argentina has demonstrated the high prevalence of intestinal parasites in a peri-urban area. These results will contribute to more accurate epidemiological survey, refined treatment strategies on a public scale, and better health outcomes in endemic settings."
2,"Prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections and associated risk factors among Kigali Institute of Education students in Kigali, Rwanda.","Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) are a significant public health problem in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) and Rwanda is not spared. While eradication programs towards preschool-aged and school-aged children are undertaken, important gaps regarding IPIs among students attending tertiary learning institutions remain. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of IPIs and associated risk factors among Kigali Institute of Education (KIE) students who attended its medical clinic for stool examination. A cross-sectional study was carried out during the 2010 academic year, from February to July. Fresh stool samples were collected from 109 students chosen randomly and were examined for the presence of eggs, cysts and parasites using direct saline smear under light microscopy. A questionnaire was also used to assess water consumption habits, eating and living places. More than half (50.5%) of the stools examined were infected with an intestinal parasite. Among the infected students, prevalence of Entamoeba histolytica was 54.5%, Trichomonas intestinalis and Ascaris lumbricoides were 20.0%, Giardia duodenalis was 3.6% and Ancylostoma duodenale was 1.8%. The prevalence of IPIs was strongly associated with drinking any kind of water (p<0.001) and eating outside of the KIE cafeteria (p<0.001) and significantly related to living outside of the KIE campus (p=0.026). The study showed that IPIs of public health relevance are prevalent among students attending tertiary schools. The importance of living and eating in hygienic environments as well as drinking safe water is crucial and all efforts need to be sustained. "
2,Status and prospects of DNA barcoding in medically important parasites and vectors.,"For over 10 years, DNA barcoding has been used to identify specimens and discern species. Its potential benefits in parasitology were recognized early, but its utility and uptake remain unclear. Here we review studies using DNA barcoding in parasites and vectors affecting humans and find that the technique is accurate (accords with author identifications based on morphology or other markers) in 94-95% of cases, although aspects of DNA barcoding (vouchering, marker implicated) have often been misunderstood. In a newly compiled checklist of parasites, vectors, and hazards, barcodes are available for 43% of all 1403 species and for more than half of 429 species of greater medical importance. This is encouraging coverage that would improve with an active campaign targeting parasites and vectors. "
2,Environmentally transmitted parasites: Host-jumping in a heterogeneous environment.,"Groups of chronically infected reservoir-hosts contaminate resource patches by shedding a parasite??s free-living stage. Novel-host groups visit the same patches, where they are exposed to infection. We treat arrival at patches, levels of parasite deposition, and infection of the novel host as stochastic processes, and derive the expected time elapsing until a host-jump (initial infection of a novel host) occurs. At stationarity, mean parasite densities are independent of reservoir-host group size. But within-patch parasite-density variances increase with reservoir group size. The probability of infecting a novel host declines with parasite-density variance; consequently larger reservoir groups extend the mean waiting time for host-jumping. Larger novel-host groups increase the probability of a host-jump during any single patch visit, but also reduce the total number of visits per unit time. Interaction of these effects implies that the waiting time for the first infection increases with the novel-host group size. If the reservoir-host uses resource patches in any non-uniform manner, reduced spatial overlap between host species increases the waiting time for host-jumping. "
2,Assessing the burden of intestinal parasites affecting newly arrived immigrants in Qatar.,"In the last decades, the enormous influx of immigrants to industrialized countries has led to outbreaks of parasitic diseases, with enteric infections being amongst the most frequently encountered. In its strategy to control such infection, Qatar has established the Pre-Employment Certificate (PEC) program which requires medical inspection before arrival in Qatar and which is mandatory for immigrant workers travelling to the country. To assess the reliability of the PEC, we conducted a survey of intestinal parasites, based on examination of stool samples provided by immigrant workers (n?€?=?€?2,486) recently arrived in Qatar.Overall prevalence of helminths was 7.0% and that of protozoa was 11.7%. Prevalence of combined helminths was highest among the western Asians and the highest prevalence of combined protozoan parasites was among workers from North to Saharan Africa. Analysis of temporal changes showed an increasing trend of protozoan infections over the investigated 3 years. A major contribution to this temporal change in prevalence came from Blastocystis hominis as well as from other protozoan species: Giardia duodenalis and Endolimax nana. Analysis of the temporal trend in species richness of the protozoan species showed a significant increase in the mean number of species harboured per subject across this period.The increase of protozoan infections over recent years raises some concerns. It suggests that screening protocols for applicants for visas/work permits needs to be revised giving more careful attention to the intestinal protozoan infections that potential immigrants may harbor."
2,Ethnomedicines and anti-parasitic activities of Pakistani medicinal plants against Plasmodia and Leishmania parasites.,"Leishmaniasis and malaria are the two most common parasitic diseases and responsible for large number of deaths per year particularly in developing countries like Pakistan. Majority of Pakistan population rely on medicinal plants due to their low socio-economic status. The present review was designed to gather utmost fragmented published data on traditionally used medicinal plants against leishmaniasis and malaria in Pakistan and their scientific validation.Pub Med, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ISI Web of knowledge and Flora of Pakistan were searched for the collection of data on ethnomedicinal plants. Total 89 articles were reviewed for present study which was mostly published in English. We selected only those articles in which complete information was given regarding traditional uses of medicinal plants in Pakistan.Total of 56 plants (malaria 33, leishmaniasis 23) was found to be used traditionally against reported parasites. Leaves were the most focused plant part both in traditional use and in in vitro screening against both parasites. Most extensively used plant families against Leishmaniasis and Malaria were Lamiaceae and Asteraceae respectively. Out of 56 documented plants only 15 plants (Plasmodia 4, Leishmania 11) were assessed in vitro against these parasites. Mostly crude and ethanolic plant extracts were checked against Leishmania and Plasmodia respectively and showed good inhibition zone. Four pure compounds like artemisinin, physalins and sitosterol extracted from different plants proved their efficacy against these parasites.Present review provides the efficacy and reliability of ethnomedicinal practices and also invites the attention of chemists, pharmacologist and pharmacist to scientifically validate unexplored plants that could lead toward the development of novel anti-malarial and anti-leishmanial drugs."
2,Prevention of intestinal parasites in a tri-border area of Latin America: Children perceptions and an integral health education strategy.,"To investigate knowledge of school-aged children and their perception on intestinal parasites, and to assess knowledge reconstruction on prevention practices after specific training in the subject. We performed an activity package that included the analysis of children's drawings of intestinal parasites, and information and communication technologies (ITCs) to transfer knowledge about these pathogens and prevention measures. Retrieval learning activities were performed to fixation of general and specific prevention and control measures.Overall, we found that there is a knowledge gap in many aspects of parasite biology and ecology, and therefore on the risk of infection and acquisition mechanisms. After ITCs, the children improved their knowledge over non-trained children.The approaches used to transfer knowledge and for learning, fixation were valuable tools for incorporating changes in misconceptions and in the deep-rooted habits that favour entero-parasitic diseases. This has important implications for the specific design of future education materials and campaigns. Understanding of perceptions helps to provide justifications and knowledge to achieve changes in unhealthy habits, and it constitutes the basis for the transformation of many risky practices."
2,Metazoan parasites from odontocetes off New Zealand: new records.,"Information about the parasite fauna of spectacled porpoises and cetaceans from New Zealand waters in general is scarce. This study takes advantage of material archived in collections of the Otago Museum in Dunedin and Massey University in Auckland, sampled from cetacean species found stranded along the New Zealand coastline between 2007 and 2014. Parasites from seven species of cetaceans (spectacled porpoise, Phocoena dioptrica (n??=??2 individuals examined); pygmy sperm whale (n??=??1); long-finned pilot whale, Globicephala melas (n??=??1); Risso's dolphin, Grampus griseus (n??=??1); short-beaked common dolphin, Delphinus delphis (n??=??7); striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba (n??=??3) and dusky dolphin, Lagenorhynchus obscurus (n??=??2)) from the respiratory and gastro-intestinal tract, cranial sinus, liver, urogenital and mammary tract, fascia and blubber were investigated. Ten parasite species were identified, belonging to the Nematoda (Stenurus minor, Stenurus globicephalae, Halocercus sp. (Pseudaliidae), Anisakis sp. (Anisakidae), Crassicauda sp. (Crassicaudidae)), Cestoda (Phyllobothrium delphini and Monorygma grimaldii (Phyllobothriidae)), Trematoda (Brachicladium palliata and Brachicladium delphini (Brachicladiidae)) and Crustacea (Scutocyamus antipodensis (Cyamidae)). Some of the parasite species encountered comprises new records for their host. Although the material was not sampled within a systematic parasitological survey, the findings contain valuable new information about the parasite fauna of rare, vagile and vulnerable marine wildlife from a remote oceanic environment."
2,"Prevalence of parasites in patients with gastroenteritis at East of Mazandaran Province, Northern Iran.","Parasitic gastrointestinal infections are one of the most important health problems   in the developing countries, which lead to the onset of intestinal disease particularly diarrhoea.   Due to the particular geographic situation in the Mazandaran province, individuals are infected   with various intestinal parasites. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence rate   of enteropathogenic parasites in the patients with gastroenteritis living at the east of   Mazandaran province (Sari, Nekah and Joybar cities), northern Iran. This descriptive study   was carried out from September 2009 to March 2010. Faecal samples were collected by   randomized cluster method from 962 patients with gastroenteritis who were refered to the   Health Service Centers of Sari, Neka and Joybar cities. All data about the patients were   recorded in questionnaire. Stool specimens were examined by direct wet mounting, formolether   concentration, and Ziehl-Neelsen acid fast stain and Auramin Phenol fluorescence   (APF) method for the investigation of Cryptosporidium and Isospora. Prevalence of intestinal   parasites and their relationship with gender, age, and season were investigated, and the   obtained data were analyzed with ???? test using the SPSS software (16.0). Out of 962 patients   with gastroenteritis, overall infection was 9.1%; Giardia lamblia (4.1%) with the highest and   Enterobius vermicularis (0.2%) with the lowest prevalence rate. Prevalence rate of other   parasites were as follow: Cryptosporidium, 0.1%; Entamoeba histolytica, 0.1%; Chilomastix   mesnili, 0.1%; Entamoeba coli, 1.2%; Blastocytis hominis, 1.8%; Trichostrongylus spp., 0.4%   and Hymenolepis nana, 0.9%. Findings showed that Giardia is the most common cause of   intestinal infection at the east of Mazandaran province, and could be defined as the most   important parasitic agent of gastroenteritis. On the other hand, infection with enteropathogenic   parasites as compared with the previous reports showed significant decline, which reveals   the coverage of health education, increase of public knowledge on the parasitic diseases and   sanitation of living environment."
2,[Stratified sampling survey of major human parasitic diseases in Henan province].,"<b>Objective:</b> To understand the prevalence of major human parasitic diseases and related factors in Henan province. <b>Methods:</b> This stratified sampling survey was carried out according to the requirement of national survey protocol of major human parasitic diseases, 2014-2015. The prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths infection, taeniasis and intestinal protozoiasis were surveyed in 104 sites selected from 35 counties (districts) and the prevalence of <i>clonorchiasis</i> was surveyed in 62 sites selected from 37 townships. In each survey spot, 250 persons were surveyed. A total of 26 866 persons and 15 893 persons were surveyed. Modified Kato-Katz thick smear was used to detect the eggs of intestinal helminthes. Tube fecal culture was used to identify the species of hookworm. The <i>Enterobius eggs</i> were detected in children aged 3 to 6 years by using adhesive tape. The cyst and trophozoite of intestinal protozoa were examined with physiological saline direct smear method and iodine stain method. <b>Results:</b> The overall infestation rate of intestinal parasites was2.02% in Henan, and the worm infection rate was higher than protozoa infection rate. Fourteen kinds of intestinal parasites were found, including nematode (5 species), trematode (2 species), and protozoan (7 species). The infection rate of <i>Enterobius vermicularis</i> was highest, and Qinba Mountain ecological area had the highest infestation rate of intestinal parasites in 4 ecological areas of Henan. There was no significant difference in intestinal parasite infection rate between males and females (<i>??</i>(2)=3.630, <i>P</i>=0.057), and the differences in intestinal parasite infection rate among different age groups had significance (<i>??</i>(2)=124.783, <i>P</i>=0.000 1). The infection rate reached the peak in age group ???9 years and the major parasite was <i>Enterobius vermicularis</i>. Furthermore the overall human infection rate of parasite showed a downward trend with the increase of educational level of the people (<i>??</i>(2)=70.969, <i>P</i>=0.000 1), the differences had significance (<i>??</i>(2)=120.118, <i>P</i>=0.000 1). For different populations, the infection rate of intestinal parasites was highest among preschool children. The infection of intestinal helminth was mainly mild, only 2 severe cases were detected. The infection rate of <i>Clonorchis sinensis</i> in urban residents was only 0.006%. Logistic regression analysis showed that being preschool children (<i>??</i>(2)=15.765, <i>P</i>=0.000 1) and drinking well water (<i>??</i>(2)=45.589, <i>P</i>=0.000 1) were the risk factors for intestinal parasite infection, and annual income per capita of farmers was the protective factor against intestinal parasite infection. The infection rates of protozoa and intestinal parasites decreased sharply compared with the results of previous two surveys, and the rate of intestinal helminth infection also dropped sharply compared with the second survey. The numbers of protozoa, helminth and intestinal parasites detected in this survey were all less than the numbers found in the previous two surveys. <b>Conclusions:</b> Compared the results of three surveys in Henan, the infection rate of protozoa and intestinal parasites showed a downward trend. The prevention and treatment of <i>Enterobius vermicularis</i> infection in children should be the key point of parasitic disease control in the future."
2,Fish population studies using parasites from the Southeastern Pacific Ocean: considering host population changes and species body size as sources of variability of parasite communities.,"Research using parasites in fish population studies in the South Eastern Pacific (SEP) is summarized. There are 27 such studies (snapshots mainly) in single host species sampled at different geographic localities and at somewhat similar times. They have been devoted mainly to economically important species, though others on coastal and intertidal fish or on less- or non-commercial species provide insights on scales of temporal and spatial variation of parasite infracommunities. Later, we assess whether the probability of harbouring parasites depends on the host species body size. Our results indicate that a stronger tool for fish population studies may be developed under regular (long term) scrutiny of parasite communities, especially of small fish host species, due to their larger variability in richness, abundance and total biomass, than in large fish species. Finally, it might also be necessary to consider the effects of fishing on parasite communities as well as the natural oscillations (coupled or not) of host and parasite populations."
2,"Marine parasites as biological tags in South American Atlantic waters, current status and perspectives.","Many marine fisheries in South American Atlantic coasts (SAAC) are threatened by overfishing and under serious risk of collapsing. The SAAC comprises a diversity of environments, possesses a complex oceanography and harbours a vast biodiversity that provide an enormous potential for using parasites as biological tags for fish stock delineation, a prerequisite for the implementation of control and management plans. Here, their use in the SAAC is reviewed. Main evidence is derived from northern Argentine waters, where fish parasite assemblages are dominated by larval helminth species that share a low specificity, long persistence and trophic transmission, parasitizing almost indiscriminately all available fish species. The advantages and constraints of such a combination of characteristics are analysed and recommendations are given for future research. Shifting the focus from fish/parasite populations to communities allows expanding the concept of biological tags from local to regional scales, providing essential information to delineate ecosystem boundaries for host communities. This new concept arose as a powerful tool to help the implementation of ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management, the new paradigm for fisheries science. Holistic approaches, including parasites as biological tags for stock delineation will render valuable information to help insure fisheries and marine ecosystems against further depletion and collapse."
2,"Parasites as valuable stock markers for fisheries in Australasia, East Asia and the Pacific Islands.","Over 30 studies in Australasia, East Asia and the Pacific Islands region have collected and analysed parasite data to determine the ranges of individual fish, many leading to conclusions about stock delineation. Parasites used as biological tags have included both those known to have long residence times in the fish and those thought to be relatively transient. In many cases the parasitological conclusions have been supported by other methods especially analysis of the chemical constituents of otoliths, and to a lesser extent, genetic data. In analysing parasite data, authors have applied multiple different statistical methodologies, including summary statistics, and univariate and multivariate approaches. Recently, a growing number of researchers have found non-parametric methods, such as analysis of similarities and cluster analysis, to be valuable. Future studies into the residence times, life cycles and geographical distributions of parasites together with more robust analytical methods will yield much important information to clarify stock structures in the area."
2,Diagnostic performance of Mini Parasep?? solvent-free faecal parasite concentrator relative to Kato-Katz and McMaster for the diagnosis of intestinal parasitic infections.,"In this cross-sectional study, we compared the performance of Mini Parasep?? solvent-free (SF) faecal parasite concentrator, Kato-Katz thick smear and McMaster techniques for the diagnosis of intestinal parasitic infections among children in Wosha Soyama Primary School, Ethiopia.Stool samples were collected from 381 children and examined for intestinal parasitic infections using Mini Parasep?? SF faecal parasite concentrator, Kato-Katz thick smear and McMaster techniques.About 86.1% of children were infected with at least one species of intestinal parasite based on combined results of the three techniques. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of Mini Parasep?? SF, Kato-Katz and McMaster tests for detecting at least one species of intestinal parasite infections were 90.2% and 62.4%, 80.0% and 44.5%, and 55.2% and 26.5%, respectively. While Mini Parasep?? SF was more sensitive in detecting Ascaris lumbricoides, Schistosoma mansoni and Hymenolepis nana infections, Kato-Katz was more sensitive in detecting Trichuris trichiura infection, and McMaster had higher sensitivity in diagnosing hookworm infection.The Mini Parasep?? SF faecal parasite concentrator technique showed better performance than the Kato-Katz and McMaster techniques for the detection of intestinal helminth infections in stool samples, particularly for S. mansoni, A. lumbricoides and H. nana. Hence, Mini Parasep?? SF could be used as one of the suitable faecal examination methods for surveillance and monitoring of preventive chemotherapy of schistosomiasis."
2,Migrant Workers in Malaysia: Current Implications of Sociodemographic and Environmental Characteristics in the Transmission of Intestinal Parasitic Infections.,"A cross-sectional study of intestinal parasitic infections amongst migrant workers in Malaysia was conducted. A total of 388 workers were recruited from five sectors including manufacturing, construction, plantation, domestic and food services. The majority were recruited from Indonesia (n = 167, 43.3%), followed by Nepal (n = 81, 20.9%), Bangladesh (n = 70, 18%), India (n = 47, 12.1%) and Myanmar (n = 23, 5.9.2%). A total of four nematode species (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Enterobius vermicularis and hookworms), one cestode (Hymenolepis nana) and three protozoan species (Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Giardia sp. and Cryptosporidium spp.) were identified. High prevalence of infections with A. lumbricoides (43.3%) was recorded followed by hookworms (13.1%), E. histolytica/dispar (11.6%), Giardia sp. (10.8%), T. trichura (9.5%), Cryptosporodium spp. (3.1%), H. nana (1.8%) and E. vermicularis (0.5%). Infections were significantly influenced by socio-demographic (nationality), and environmental characteristics (length of working years in the country, employment sector and educational level). Up to 84.0% of migrant workers from Nepal and 83.0% from India were infected with intestinal parasites, with the ascarid nematode A. lumbricoides occurring in 72.8% of the Nepalese and 68.1% of the Indian population. In addition, workers with an employment history of less than a year or newly arrived in Malaysia were most likely to show high levels of infection as prevalence of workers infected with A. lumbricoides was reduced from 58.2% to 35.4% following a year's residence. These findings suggest that improvement is warranted in public health and should include mandatory medical screening upon entry into the country."
2,A systematic review of parasites and micropredators of non-avian reptiles (Reptilia=Sauropsida) in Chile.,"Knowledge about the identity of parasites in vertebrates is relevant because of their influence on ecological processes and health of their hosts. This is particularly important for groups of animals currently facing conservation issues, such as reptiles. The diversity of species and supra-specific taxa of microparasites and macroparasites (such as helminths and arthropods) present in non-avian reptiles in Chile was analyzed through a systematic review. A total of 49 scientific documents (thesis projects, abstracts in congresses, book chapters and peer-reviewed articles) concerning parasites, taxonomic descriptions and parasite ecology were included in this review. The suborder Iguania was among the most studied group with 35 native species recognized as hosts of parasites and 39 species of parasites reported up to the category of species or genus. Liolaemus tenuis was the species with the most taxa of recorded parasites (11 taxa, and only three to species level), but Liolaemus chillanensis had the highest number of identified species of parasites. In addition, only one native species of Serpentes, one of Gymnophthalmoidea, and two of Gekkota, as well as some reports of exotic species, were recorded as hosts. Among parasites, Trombidiformes was the richest order with 10 species from the superfamily Pterygosomatoidea and 16 species from Trombiculoidea. Current knowledge about the richness of helminths is very limited and there were only a few records of microparasites. In general, there is an urgent need for the development of collaborative works between specialists in reptile taxonomy and epidemiology in parasitology destined to evaluate the consequences that reptiles and their parasites will suffer due to the ongoing processes of habitat loss, climate change and the still present taxonomic issues of the native reptiles."
2,Blood parasites in reptiles imported to Germany.,"Though international trade is increasing, the significance of imported reptiles as carriers of pathogens with relevance to animal and human health is largely unknown. Reptiles imported to Germany were therefore investigated for blood parasites using light microscopy, and the detected parasites were morphologically characterized. Four hundred ten reptiles belonging to 17 species originating from 11 Asian, South American and African countries were included. Parasites were detected in 117 (29%) of individual reptiles and in 12 species. Haemococcidea (Haemogregarina, Hepatozoon, Schellackia) were found in 84% of snakes (Python regius, Corallus caninus), 20% of lizards (Acanthocercus atricollis, Agama agama, Kinyongia fischeri, Gekko gecko) and 50% of turtles (Pelusios castaneus). Infections with Hematozoea (Plasmodium, Sauroplasma) were detected in 14% of lizards (Acanthocercus atricollis, Agama agama, Agama mwanzae, K. fischeri, Furcifer pardalis, Xenagama batillifera, Acanthosaura capra, Physignathus cocincinus), while those with Kinetoplastea (Trypanosoma) were found in 9% of snakes (Python regius, Corallus caninus) and 25 % of lizards (K. fischeri, Acanthosaura capra, G. gecko). Nematoda including filarial larvae parasitized in 10% of lizards (Agama agama, Agama mwanzae, K. fischeri, Fu. pardalis, Physignathus cocincinus). Light microscopy mostly allowed diagnosis of the parasites' genus, while species identification was not possible because of limited morphological characteristics available for parasitic developmental stages. The investigation revealed a high percentage of imported reptiles being carriers of parasites while possible vectors and pathogenicity are largely unknown so far. The spreading of haemoparasites thus represents an incalculable risk for pet reptiles, native herpetofauna and even human beings."
2,Novel amidines and analogues as promising agents against intracellular parasites: a systematic review.,"Parasitic protozoa comprise diverse aetiological agents responsible for important diseases in humans and animals including sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, malaria, toxoplasmosis and others. They are major causes of mortality and morbidity in tropical and subtropical countries, and are also responsible for important economic losses. However, up to now, for most of these parasitic diseases, effective vaccines are lacking and the approved chemotherapeutic compounds present high toxicity, increasing resistance, limited efficacy and require long periods of treatment. Many of these parasitic illnesses predominantly affect low-income populations of developing countries for which new pharmaceutical alternatives are urgently needed. Thus, very low research funding is available. Amidine-containing compounds such as pentamidine are DNA minor groove binders with a broad spectrum of activities against human and veterinary pathogens. Due to their promising microbicidal activity but their rather poor bioavailability and high toxicity, many analogues and derivatives, including pro-drugs, have been synthesized and screened in vitro and in vivo in order to improve their selectivity and pharmacological properties. This review summarizes the knowledge on amidines and analogues with respect to their synthesis, pharmacological profile, mechanistic and biological effects upon a range of intracellular protozoan parasites. The bulk of these data may contribute to the future design and structure optimization of new aromatic dicationic compounds as novel antiparasitic drug candidates."
2,Prevalence and Risk Factors of Intestinal Parasites in Cats from China.,"The prevalence of intestinal parasites in cats from China was largely unknown prior to this study. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of intestinal parasites in cats from central China and also identify risk factors for parasitism. Fecal samples from 360 cats were examined using sugar flotation procedure and fecal smear test by microscope. Cats had mixed two or three kinds of parasites infections. Of the 360 cats feces, intestinal parasites positive feces were 149 (41.39%). 64 (17.78%) were infected with Toxocara cati, 61 (16.94%) with Isospora felis, 41 (11.39%) with Isospora rivolta, 33 (9.17%) with Paragonimus, 23 (6.39%) with hookworms, 11 (3.06%) with Toxoplasma-like oocysts, 10 (2.78%) with Trichuris, 4 (1.11%) with lungworm, 2 (0.56%) with Sarcocystis, and 1 (0.28%) with Trematode. The cats' living outdoor was identified as risk factor by statistical analysis. These results provide relevant basic data for assessing the infection of intestinal parasites in cats from central region of China. In conclusion, there was high prevalence of intestinal parasites in cats from China. "
2,Helminth parasites of South American fishes: current status and characterization as a model for studies of biodiversity.,"The South American subcontinent supports one of the world's most diverse and commercially very important ichthyofauna. In this context, the study of South American fish parasites is of increased relevance in understanding their key roles in ecosystems, regulating the abundance or density of host populations, stabilizing food webs and structuring host communities. It is hard to estimate the number of fish parasites in South America. The number of fish species studied for parasites is still low (less than 10%), although the total number of host-parasite associations (HPAs) found in the present study was 3971. Monogeneans, with 835 species (1123 HPAs, 28.5%), and trematodes, with 662 species (1127 HPAs, 30.9%), are the more diverse groups. Data gathered from the literature are useful to roughly estimate species richness of helminths from South American fish, even though there are some associated problems: the reliability of information depends on accurate species identification; the lack of knowledge about life cycles; the increasing number of discoveries of cryptic species and the geographically biased number of studies. Therefore, the closest true estimations of species diversity and distribution will rely on further studies combining both molecular and morphological approaches with ecological data such as host specificity, geographical distribution and life-cycle data. Research on biodiversity of fish parasites in South America is influenced by problems such as funding, taxonomic impediments and dispersion of research groups. Increasing collaboration, interchange and research networks in the context of globalization will enable a promising future for fish parasitology in South America."
2,Survey of parasites in threatened stocks of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in Oregon by examination of wet tissues and histology.,"We are conducting studies on the impacts of parasites on Oregon coastal coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kistuch). An essential first step is documenting the geographic distribution of infections, which may be accomplished by using different methods for parasite detection. Thus, the objectives of the current study were to (1) identify parasite species infecting these stocks of coho salmon and document their prevalence, density, and geographic distribution; (2) assess the pathology of these infections; and (3) for the first time, determine the sensitivity and specificity of histology for detecting parasites compared with examining wet preparations for muscle and gill infections. We examined 576 fry, parr, and smolt coho salmon in total by histology. The muscle and gills of 219 of these fish also were examined by wet preparation. Fish were collected from 10 different locations in 2006-2007. We identified 21 different species of parasites in these fish. Some parasites, such as Nanophyetus salmincola and Myxobolus insidiosus, were common across all fish life stages from most basins. Other parasites, such as Apophallus sp., were more common in underyearling fish than smolts and had a more restricted geographic distribution. Additional parasites commonly observed were as follows: Sanguinicola sp., Trichodina truttae , Epistylis sp., Capriniana piscium, and unidentified metacercariae in gills; Myxobolus sp. in brain; Myxidium salvelini and Chloromyxum majori in kidney; Pseudocapillaria salvelini and adult digenean spp. in the intestine. Only a few parasites, such as the unidentified gill metacercariae, elicted overt pathologic changes. Histology had generally poor sensitivity for detecting parasites; however, it had relatively good specificity. We recommend using both methods for studies or monitoring programs requiring a comprehensive assessment of parasite identification, enumeration, and parasite-related pathology."
2,Multiple parasitic and viral infections in a patient living with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy.,"Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are more prone for gastrointestinal infections causing diarrhoea, particularly with parasites. Parasitic infections have been regularly reported in such patients. A female patient confirmed positive for HIV 1 on antiretroviral therapy came with complaints of chronic diarrhoea for the past 7 months. Her initial CD4 count was 89 cells/??l of blood, and antibodies to cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 virus were found to be positive in the patient's serum, but there was no HIV-associated retinopathy. Her stool examination showed decorticated fertilised eggs of Ascaris lumbricoides, cysts of Blastocystis sp. and Entamoeba species in the unconcentrated sample and oocysts of Cystoisospora species, egg of Schistosoma haematobium and eggs of Trichuris trichiura in the concentrated. The patient responded well to cotrimoxazole and albendazole, and repeat samples were negative for all these parasites."
2,Detection of parasites in children with chronic diarrhea.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of intestinal parasites in patients with chronic diarrhea and clarify the importance of these parasitic pathogens in such cases. A total of 60 pediatric patients with chronic diarrhea between June 2012 and October 2014 were enrolled in the study. Out of 60 stool samples, five were positive for Giardia lamblia, two, Dientamoeba fragilis, and one, Blastocystis hominis. One stool sample was positive for Entamoeba hartmanni and B. hominis, another one was positive for G. lamblia and B. hominis, another, G. lamblia and E. hartmanni and one sample was positive for Enterobius vermicularis, D. fragilis and B. hominis together. Parasitic infection, which decreases quality of life and increases susceptibility to other infections, should not be neglected, particularly in patients with chronic diarrhea. Accurate diagnosis decreases morbidity and mortality in patients with parasite infection. "
2,Host-Manipulation by Trophically Transmitted Parasites: The Switcher-Paradigm.,"Host-manipulation by trophically transmitted parasites is thought to always predispose the intermediate hosts to enhanced predation by definitive hosts ('enhancement'). However, theory predicts that enhancement can disrupt stable, bottom-heavy predator-prey ratios, leading to fluctuation-driven extinction of intermediate hosts and parasites. How then can enhancement persist in nature despite this apparent instability? We address this paradox and conceptualize the 'switcher-paradigm', a novel framework incorporating sequential phases of reduced predation ('suppression') followed by enhancement. Theoretical models within the framework that consider 'switching' from suppression to enhancement indicate that switching likely increases parasite persistence and, in some circumstances, cancels out the effects of strong enhancement, leading to bottom-heavy predator-prey ratios. The switcher-paradigm confronts interdisciplinary research challenges, linking ecological processes across scales from within-host to community-wide dynamics."
2,Internal parasitic fauna of elk (Alces alces) in Poland.,"The abundance of elk (Alces alces) in Poland at the beginning of 2016 reached over 28 000 individual animals. However, little is still known about health status of elk population in the country. In particular, important health issue tend to be parasitic diseases which are the most common diseases in wild animals. Special emphasis should be given to the parasitofauna of elks. Their ability to move over great distances increases the chance of parasitic infestations in new areas and transmission to other wild animals and livestock. The aim of this article is to describe the parasites occurring in elk in Poland on the basis of previous studies from the country and to compare them with data from neighboring countries. The presented review reveals that elk populations have not been examined for the presence of parasites for decades, and no recent studies in Poland have examined the parasitofauna of this animal. As such, our study shows that assessing the parasites present in elk populations remains an important area of research."
2,Disease severity in patients with visceral leishmaniasis is not altered by co-infection with intestinal parasites.,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease that affects the poorest communities and can cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Visceral leishmaniasis is characterized by the presence of Leishmania parasites in the spleen, liver and bone marrow, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, prolonged fever, systemic inflammation and low body mass index (BMI). The factors impacting on the severity of VL are poorly characterized. Here we performed a cross-sectional study to assess whether co-infection of VL patients with intestinal parasites influences disease severity, assessed with clinical and haematological data, inflammation, cytokine profiles and BMI. Data from VL patients was similar to VL patients co-infected with intestinal parasites, suggesting that co-infection of VL patients with intestinal parasites does not alter disease severity."
2,Amplicon-Based Pyrosequencing Reveals High Diversity of Protistan Parasites in Ships' Ballast Water: Implications for Biogeography and Infectious Diseases.,"Ships' ballast water (BW) commonly moves macroorganisms and microorganisms across the world's oceans and along coasts; however, the majority of these microbial transfers have gone undetected. We applied high-throughput sequencing methods to identify microbial eukaryotes, specifically emphasizing the protistan parasites, in ships' BW collected from vessels calling to the Chesapeake Bay (Virginia and Maryland, USA) from European and Eastern Canadian ports. We utilized tagged-amplicon 454 pyrosequencing with two general primer sets, amplifying either the V4 or V9 domain of the small subunit (SSU) of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene complex, from total DNA extracted from water samples collected from the ballast tanks of bulk cargo vessels. We detected a diverse group of protistan taxa, with some known to contain important parasites in marine systems, including Apicomplexa (unidentified apicomplexans, unidentified gregarines, Cryptosporidium spp.), Dinophyta (Blastodinium spp., Euduboscquella sp., unidentified syndinids, Karlodinium spp., Syndinium spp.), Perkinsea (Parvilucifera sp.), Opisthokonta (Ichthyosporea sp., Pseudoperkinsidae, unidentified ichthyosporeans), and Stramenopiles (Labyrinthulomycetes). Further characterization of groups with parasitic taxa, consisting of phylogenetic analyses for four taxa (Cryptosporidium spp., Parvilucifera spp., Labyrinthulomycetes, and Ichthyosporea), revealed that sequences were obtained from both known and novel lineages. This study demonstrates that high-throughput sequencing is a viable and sensitive method for detecting parasitic protists when present and transported in the ballast water of ships. These data also underscore the potential importance of human-aided dispersal in the biogeography of these microbes and emerging diseases in the world's oceans."
2,"Parasitic stool testing in newly arrived refugees in Calgary, Alta.","To determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites and rates of stool testing compliance, as well as associated patient characteristics, among newly arrived refugees at the Mosaic Refugee Health Clinic in Calgary, Alta.Retrospective chart review.Primary care clinic for refugee patients.A total of 1390 new refugee patients at the clinic from May 1, 2011, to June 30, 2013.Stool ova and parasite test completion and proportion of positive test results.Of 1390 patients, 74.1% (95% CI 71.7% to 76.4%) completed at least 1 stool ova and parasite test. Among those completing tests, 29.7% (95% CI 26.9% to 32.6%) had at least 1 positive result. Patients aged 6 to 18 years were more likely to have positive test results (38.5%, 95% CI 32.2% to 45.0%) than patients aged 19 to 39 were, as were those last residing in Asia (36.4%, 95% CI 30.4% to 42.8%) or sub-Saharan Africa (30.9%, 95% CI 26.8% to 35.1%), compared with those arriving from the Middle East. <i>Giardia lamblia, Blastocystis hominis, Dientamoeba fragilis,</i> and <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> or <i>Entamoeba dispar</i> were the most prevalent parasites. If <i>B hominis</i> and <i>D fragilis</i> are excluded because of their lower potential to cause harm, the overall prevalence was 16.3%.Given the high compliance of patients submitting stool ova and parasite tests and a high prevalence of positive test results in some refugee groups, targeted screening should be considered in newly arrived refugees at greater risk of intestinal parasites."
2,Fish parasites as indicators of organic pollution in southern Brazil.,"Increasing urbanization along riverbanks is a constant source of stressors to the aquatic community, and the use of bioindicators is suitable to detect and monitor the effect of each stressor. We investigated the parasites of the 'car??' fish (Geophagus brasiliensis) as potential bioindicators in a river whose banks are subject to increasing anthropogenic pressure. Samples were taken at four points of the Sangradouro River, in Florian??polis, southern Brazil, bimonthly for 12 months. Water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and salinity were measured at each point and water samples were taken for nutrient analysis (total nitrogen, nitrite, total ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, phosphate), and total and faecal coliforms. A generalized linear model (GLM) was constructed using the abundance of each parasite species as the response variable and biometric characteristic of the fish and water variables as possible predictors. Among the 137 fish examined, 114 (83.2%) were parasitized by at least one parasite species. Two species of ectoparasites (Sciadicleithrum guanduensis and Neascus-type metacercariae) and two species of endoparasites (Pandosentis aff. iracundus and Homalometron pseudopallidum) were observed. This is the first record of the genus Pandosentis in Brazilian waters and the first record of the species G. brasiliensis as a host for this parasite. Among the analysed groups of parasites, monogeneans and acanthocephalans proved to be the most sensitive to the concentrations of dissolved oxygen, faecal coliforms and total ammonia nitrogen in the water. Our study suggests that the abundance of both monoxenic and heteroxenous parasites can be negatively affected by organic pollution in the aquatic environment, reinforcing the potential of fish parasites as indicators of water quality."
2,Prevalence of intestinal parasites in breeding kennel dogs in Japan.,"The present study is the first to show overall prevalences of intestinal parasites among breeding kennel dogs in Japan. A total of 573 fresh fecal samples were collected from dogs at 12 breeding kennels. Giardia-specific coproantigen was examined by ELISA kit (SNAP(??) Giardia, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Maine, USA). Other intestinal parasites were determined microscopically using the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation technique. Overall prevalences of two genera of protists, Giardia spp. and Cystoisospora spp., were 25.7 and 1.2 %, respectively. The prevalence of helminthes was recorded as: Toxocara canis 0.2 %, Toxascaris leonina 0.9 %, Ancylostoma caninum 0.2 %, Trichuris vulpis 2.1 %, and Spirometra erinacei 0.4 %. According to age categories, Giardia spp., Cystoisospora spp., and T. leonina in <1-year-old dogs were significantly more prevalent than in ??? 1-year-old dogs (61.0 vs. 19.8 %, P < 0.0001; 7.3 vs. 0.2 %, P < 0.0001; and 4.9 vs. 0.2 %, P < 0.001; respectively). With respect to fecal condition, the prevalences of T. leonina and T. vulpis were significantly higher in unformed stool dogs than in formed ones (2.4 vs. 0 %, P < 0.01, and 4.3 vs. 0.8 %, P < 0.05, respectively). In all of the breeding kennels except for one kennel, intestinal parasite infections were found at the high prevalent, ranging from 16.0 to 70.0 %."
2,Diverse sampling of East African haemosporidians reveals chiropteran origin of malaria parasites in primates and rodents.,"Phylogenies of parasites provide hypotheses on the history of their movements between hosts, leading to important insights regarding the processes of host switching that underlie modern-day epidemics. Haemosporidian (malaria) parasites lack a well resolved phylogeny, which has impeded the study of evolutionary processes associated with host-switching in this group. Here we present a novel phylogenetic hypothesis that suggests bats served as the ancestral hosts of malaria parasites in primates and rodents. Expanding upon current taxon sampling of Afrotropical bat and bird parasites, we find strong support for all major nodes in the haemosporidian tree using both Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Our analyses support a single transition of haemosporidian parasites from saurian to chiropteran hosts, and do not support a monophyletic relationship between Plasmodium parasites of birds and mammals. We find, for the first time, that Hepatocystis and Plasmodium parasites of mammals represent reciprocally monophyletic evolutionary lineages. These results highlight the importance of broad taxonomic sampling when analyzing phylogenetic relationships, and have important implications for our understanding of key host switching events in the history of malaria parasite evolution."
2,A description of parasites from Iranian snakes.,"Little is known of the parasitic fauna of terrestrial snakes in Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the parasitic infection rates of snakes in Iran. A total of 87 snakes belonging to eight different species, that were collected between May 2012 and September 2012 and died after the hold in captivity, under which they were kept for taking poisons, were examined for the presence of gastrointestinal and blood parasites. According to our study 12 different genera of endoparasites in 64 (73.56%) of 87 examined snakes were determined. Forty one snakes (47.12%) had gastrointestinal parasites. In prepared blood smears, it was found that in 23 (26.43%) of 87 examined snakes there are at least one hemoparasite. To our knowledge, these are the first data on the internal parasitic fauna of Iranian terrestrial snakes and our findings show a higher prevalence of these organisms among them. "
2,Parasites and their (endo)symbiotic microbes.,"Thanks to modern molecular biology methods, our understanding of the impact of (endo)symbiotic bacteria on parasitic protists and helminths is growing fast. In this issue, 9 papers have been brought together that describe various facets of the relationships between these microorganisms, reveal their range and high frequency, as well as their capacity to create novel biological complexity. Comparative analyses of these host-endosymbiont interactions indicate that there may be no discrete types of relationships but rather a continuum ranging from a dispensable endosymbiont minimally integrated within the host cell to organelles, such as mitochondria and plastids that evolved into an indispensable, deeply integrated components of the cell. We hope that this series of studies on parasites and (endo)symbiotic bacteria will increase awareness about these relationships and their representation in microbial ecology models."
2,Diverse Applications of Environmental DNA Methods in Parasitology.,"Nucleic acid extraction and sequencing of genes from organisms within environmental samples encompasses a variety of techniques collectively referred to as environmental DNA or 'eDNA'. The key advantages of eDNA analysis include the detection of cryptic or otherwise elusive organisms, large-scale sampling with fewer biases than specimen-based methods, and generation of data for molecular systematics. These are particularly relevant for parasitology because parasites can be difficult to locate and are morphologically intractable and genetically divergent. However, parasites have rarely been the focus of eDNA studies. Focusing on eukaryote parasites, we review the increasing diversity of the 'eDNA toolbox'. Combining eDNA methods with complementary tools offers much potential to understand parasite communities, disease risk, and parasite roles in broader ecosystem processes such as food web structuring and community assembly. "
2,Prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among communities living in different habitats and its comparison with one hundred and one studies conducted over the past 42 years (1970 to 2013) in Malaysia.,"Intestinal parasitic infections are among the most common diseases affecting mankind causing major public health problems to billions of people living in developing countries. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites in various communities residing in different habitats in Malaysia and compare the findings with 101 studies conducted over the past 42 years (1970-2013). A cross-sectional study design was conducted with the aid of a questionnaire to collect relevant information about the study population. Faecal samples were examined using the direct smear and formal ether sedimentation techniques. A total of 342 children were examined amongst whom 24.6% were positive for intestinal parasitic infections. Results showed that 32.3% of rural children, 20.6% of urban squatters and 5.4% of children from flats were positive for one or more parasites. The most common parasite encountered was Trichuris trichiura (20.2%) followed by Ascaris lumbricoides (10.5%) and hookworm (6.7%). No case of hookworm was reported in urban children whereas 12.2% of rural children were positive. The most common protozoan parasite detected was Entamoeba coli (3.2%) followed by Giardia intestinalis (1.8%), Entamoeba histolytica (1.8%) and Blastocystis hominis (1.2%). Nearly one-fifth (18.4%) of the children had single infection followed by double (12.0%) and triple infections (1.2%). Orang Asli (indigenous) children (44.3%) had the highest infection rate followed by Indians (20.2%), Malays (14.0%) and Chinese (11.9%). Twenty-eight studies carried out on plantation communities with regards to intestinal parasitic infections in Malaysia from 1970 to 2013 showed a steady decline in the prevalence rate ranging from 95.0% in the seventies to 37.0 % in 2012. Intestinal parasitic infections were more common in Orang Asli communities with prevalence ranging from over 90% in the seventies and fluctuating below 70% in most studies between 2000 to 2013 except for two studies that showed a prevalence of 98.2% and 100%. The prevalence rate among urban squatters, urban residents and those living in flats showed dramatic decrease in prevalence rate. "
2,Estimating the elimination feasibility in the 'end game' of control efforts for parasites subjected to regular mass drug administration: Methods and their application to schistosomiasis.,"Progress towards controlling and eliminating parasitic worms, including schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and lymphatic filariasis, is advancing rapidly as national governments, multinational NGOs, and pharmaceutical companies launch collaborative chemotherapeutic control campaigns. Critical questions remain regarding the potential for achieving elimination of these infections, and analytical methods can help to quickly estimate progress towards-and the probability of achieving-elimination over specific timeframes. Here, we propose the effective reproduction number, Reff, as a proxy of elimination potential for sexually reproducing worms that are subject to poor mating success at very low abundance (positive density dependence, or Allee effects). Reff is the number of parasites produced by a single reproductive parasite at a given stage in the transmission cycle, over the parasite's lifetime-it is the generalized form of the more familiar basic reproduction number, R0, which only applies at the beginning of an epidemic-and it can be estimated in a 'model-free' manner by an estimator ('??'). We introduce ??, demonstrate its estimation using simulated data, and discuss how it may be used in planning and evaluation of ongoing elimination efforts for a range of parasitic diseases."
2,Dendritic cells and parasites: from recognition and activation to immune response instruction.,"The effective defense against parasite infections requires the ability to mount an appropriate and controlled specific immune response able to eradicate the invading pathogen while limiting the collateral damage to self-tissues. Dendritic cells are key elements for the development of immunity against parasites; they control the responses required to eliminate these pathogens while maintaining host homeostasis. Ligation of dendritic cell pattern recognition receptors by pathogen-associated molecular pattern present in the parasites initiates signaling pathways that lead to the production of surface and secreted proteins that are required, together with the antigen, to induce an appropriate and timely regulated immune response. There is evidence showing that parasites can influence and regulate dendritic cell functions in order to promote a more permissive environment for their survival. In this review, we will focus on new insights about the ability of protozoan and helminth parasites or their products to modify dendritic cell function and discuss how this interaction is crucial in shaping the host response."
2,"Evolutionary processes involved in the diversification of chelonian and mammal polystomatid parasites (Platyhelminthes, Monogenea, Polystomatidae) revealed by palaeoecology of their hosts.","Polystomatid flatworms (Platyhelminthes) are monogenean parasites that infect exclusively aquatic or semi-aquatic sarcopterygians such as the Australian lungfish, amphibians, freshwater turtles and the African common hippopotamus. Previous studies on the phylogenetic relationships of these parasites, excluding Oculotrema hippopotami infecting common hippos, showed a global coevolution between hosts and their parasites at a macroevolutionary scale. These studies also demonstrated a strong correlation between the diversification of early neobatrachian polystomes and Gondwana breakup in the Mesozoic period. However the origin of chelonian polystomes is still in question as a switch from presumably primitive aquatic amniotes to turtles at the time of their first appearance, or soon after during their radiation, was assumed. In order to resolve this sticking point, we extended the phylogeny of polystomes with broader parasite sampling, i.e. 55 polystome species including Nanopolystoma tinsleyi a polystome infecting caecilians and O. hippopotami, and larger set of sequence data covering two nuclear and two mitochondrial genes coding for the ribosomal RNA 18S and 28S, the Cytochrome c Oxidase I and the ribosomal RNA 12S, respectively. The secondary structure of nuclear rRNAs genes (stems and loops) was taken into account for sequence alignments and Bayesian analyses were performed based on the appropriate models of evolution selected independently for the four designed partitions. Molecular calibrations were also conducted for dating the main speciation events in the polystome tree. The phylogenetic position of chelonian parasites that are phylogenetically closer to N. tinsleyi than all other amphibian polystomes and molecular time estimates suggest that these parasites originated following a switch from caecilians, at a geological period when primitive turtles may already have adapted to an aquatic life style, i.e. at about 178Million years ago, or a little later when the crown group of extant turtles have already diversified, i.e. at about 152Mya. Similarly, because O. hippopotami constitutes the sister group of chelonian parasites, proposing that an African caecilian could be the ancestral host for this polystome species seems at this stage the most likely hypothesis to explain its occurrence within the common hippo. Regardless of the scenario that may be predicted to explain the origin of polystomes within aquatic or semi-aquatic amniotes, their presence and evolution are indicative of early aquatic ecological habits within ancestral lineages. "
2,The origin and genetic differentiation of the socially parasitic aphid Tamalia inquilinus.,"Social and brood parasitisms are nonconsumptive forms of parasitism involving the exploitation of the colonies or nests of a host. Such parasites are often related to their hosts and may evolve in various ecological contexts, causing evolutionary constraints and opportunities for both parasites and their hosts. In extreme cases, patterns of diversification between social parasites and their hosts can be coupled, such that diversity of one is correlated with or even shapes the diversity of the other. Aphids in the genus Tamalia induce galls on North American manzanita (Arctostaphylos) and related shrubs (Arbutoideae) and are parasitized by nongalling social parasites or inquilines in the same genus. We used RNA sequencing to identify and generate new gene sequences for Tamalia and performed maximum-likelihood, Bayesian and phylogeographic analyses to reconstruct the origins and patterns of diversity and host-associated differentiation in the genus. Our results indicate that the Tamalia inquilines are monophyletic and closely related to their gall-forming hosts on Arctostaphylos, supporting a previously proposed scenario for origins of these parasitic aphids. Unexpectedly, population structure and host-plant-associated differentiation were greater in the non-gall-inducing parasites than in their gall-inducing hosts. RNA-seq indicated contrasting patterns of gene expression between host aphids and parasites, and perhaps functional differences in host-plant relationships. Our results suggest a mode of speciation in which host plants drive within-guild diversification in insect hosts and their parasites. Shared host plants may be sufficient to promote the ecological diversification of a network of phytophagous insects and their parasites, as exemplified by Tamalia aphids. "
2,"Risk Factors and Relationship Between Intestinal Parasites and the Growth Retardation and Psychomotor Development Delays of Children in ??anl??urfa, Turkey.","The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors for and relationship among parasitic infections, growth retardation, and psychomotor developmental delays in children aged 6 years and below.This case-control study was performed in ??anl??urfa in southeastern Turkey between October and December 2007. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire, anthropometry, Ankara Development Screening Inventory, and laboratory analysis of stool specimens.The most common parasite was Giardia intestinalis (42.53%) followed by Enterobius vermicularis (27.58%), Ascaris lumbricoides (18.39%), Hymenolepis nana (5.75%), Trichuris trichiura (3.45%), Escherichia coli (1.15%), and Blastocystis spp. (1.15%). Fifty-eight percent of all children were infected with intestinal parasites; 55.2% had only one parasite, whereas 44.8% had multiple parasites. The children infected with G. intestinalis and other intestinal parasites had significantly higher levels of growth retardation and psychomotor development delay than non-infected children. Children with parasitic infections had growth delay up to 2.9 times, general development delay up to 1.9 times, language-cognitive development delay up to 2.2 times, and fine motor development delay up to 2.9 times higher than children without any parasitic infections. However, no significant relationship among intestinal parasites, gross motor development, social-self skills, and development delay was identified. The education level of parents, poor economic situation, number of households, not washing hands, playing with soil, family history of parasitic infection were the significant risk factors for intestinal parasites.Our study indicates that the presence of either malnutrition or intestinal parasites may put a child in a high-risk group for developmental delays and growth retardation. Therefore, public health interventions can embrace nationwide deworming in children."
2,The Effect of Intestinal Parasitic Infection on the Clinical Outcome of Malaria in Coinfected Children in Cameroon.,"The interaction between intestinal parasites and malaria is still not clear. Data in published literature are conflicting. We studied the effect of intestinal parasitic infection (IPI) on the clinical outcome of malaria in coinfected children.In a cross sectional study performed between October 2014 and September 2015, children infected with malaria, as demonstrated by the presence of asexual parasites in Giemsa stained blood films, were enrolled. Stool samples were obtained from participants and subjected to the formol-ether concentration technique for the detection of intestinal parasites. The Complete blood count was performed using an automated haematology analyser (Mindray, BC-2800). The risk ratio, Pearson's chi-square and the student T test were all performed as part of the statistical analyses. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.In all, 405 children successfully took part in the study. The children were between 1 week and 120 months of age (mean ?? SD = 41.5 ?? 33.5). Coinfection with intestinal parasites was observed in 11.6%. The rate of severe malaria (SM) attack in this study was 10.9%. SM was not observed to be associated with age (p = 0.377) or gender (p = 0.387), meanwhile coinfection with intestinal parasites was associated with age (p = 0.003). Among SM cases, IPI prevalence was higher in children with mild (WHO group 3) severe malaria (p = 0.027). Overall, IPI was not observed to be associated with SM (p = 0.656) or malaria parasite density (p = 0.185) or haemoglobin concentration (p = 0.205). The main clinical features of SM observed were hyperpyrexia (68.2%), severe malarial anaemia (61.4%), and multiple convulsion (52.3%).IPI was not observed to be associated with the severity of malaria, the malaria parasite density, and the haemoglobin concentration in coinfected children in Cameroon. The clinical outcome of malaria in children coinfected with intestinal parasites may depend on the geographical setting after all."
2,Parasites of orangutans (primates: ponginae): An overview.,"Wild orangutan populations exist in an increasingly fragile state. As numbers continue to decline and populations became fragmented, the overall health of remaining individuals becomes increasingly at risk. Parasitic infections can have a serious impact on the health of wild orangutans, and can be fatal. It has been reported that rehabilitated individuals demonstrate a higher prevalence of parasitic diseases, and it is possible that they may spread these infections to wild orangutans upon reintroduction. In order to ensure the success of reintroduction and conservation efforts, it is crucial to understand the potential risks by fully understanding what parasites they have been reported to be infected with. Using this knowledge, future conservation strategies can be adapted to minimize the risk and prevalence of parasite transmission in the remaining orangutan populations. There is still limited information available on orangutan parasites, with several still not identified to the species level. Based on comprehensive literature review, we found 51 parasite taxa known to infect wild, semi-wild, and captive orangutans, including newly reported species. Here, we summarize methods used to identify parasites and draw conclusions relative to their reported prevalence. We also recommend fecal sample preservation and analytical methods to obtain best result in the future."
2,"A cross-sectional study on intestinal parasitic infections in rural communities, northeast Thailand.","Despite the existence of effective anthelmintics, parasitic infections remain a major public health problem in Southeast Asia, including Thailand. In rural communities, continuing infection is often reinforced by dietary habits that have a strong cultural basis and by poor personal hygiene and sanitation. This study presents a survey of the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among the people in rural Thailand. The community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in villages in Khon Kaen Province, northeastern Thailand, from March to August 2013. A total of 253 stool samples from 102 males and 140 females, aged 2-80 years, were prepared using formalin-ethyl acetate concentration methods and examined using light microscopy. Ninety-four individuals (37.2%) were infected with 1 or more parasite species. Presence of parasitic infection was significantly correlated with gender (P=0.001); nearly half of males in this survey (49.0%) were infected. Older people had a higher prevalence than younger members of the population. The most common parasite found was Opisthorchis viverrini (26.9%), followed by Strongyloides stercoralis (9.5%), Taenia spp. (1.6%), echinostomes (0.4%), and hookworms (0.4%). The prevalence of intestinal protozoa was Blastocystis hominis 1.6%, Entamoeba histolytica 0.8%, Entamoeba coli 0.8%, Balantidium coli 0.4%, Iodamoeba b??tschlii 0.4%, and Sarcocystis hominis 0.4%. Co-infections of various helminths and protozoa were present in 15.9% of the people. The present results show that the prevalence of parasitic infections in this region is still high. Proactive education about dietary habits, personal hygiene, and sanitation should be provided to the people in this community to reduce the prevalence of intestinal parasite infections. Moreover, development of policies and programs to control parasites is needed. "
2,Parasites contribute to ecologically dependent postmating isolation in the adaptive radiation of three-spined stickleback.,"Spatial variation in parasitic infections is common, and has the potential to drive population divergence and the reproductive isolation of hosts. However, despite support from theory and model laboratory systems, little strong evidence has been forthcoming from the wild. Here, we show that parasites are likely to cause reproductive isolation in the adaptive radiation of three-spined stickleback. Adjacent wild populations on the Scottish island of North Uist differ greatly and consistently in the occurrence of different parasites that have substantial effects on fitness. Laboratory-reared fish are more resistant to experimental infection by parasite species from their own population. Furthermore, hybrid backcrosses between the host populations are more resistant to parasites from the parental population to which they are more closely related. These patterns provide strong evidence that parasites can cause ecological speciation, by contributing to selection against migrants and ecologically dependent postmating isolation."
2,"Intestinal parasitic infections and its association with undernutrition and CD4 T cell levels among HIV/AIDS patients on HAART in Butajira, Ethiopia.","Intestinal parasitic infections and HIV/AIDS have been the major public health problems and remain a vital cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Both problems are linked in a vicious cycle. The magnitude of intestinal parasites was prevalent among people living with HIV/AIDS even in the HAART era. However, the pertinent risk factors associated with intestinal parasites among HIV/AIDS patients were not well investigated in Ethiopia particularly at Butajira town. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites and associated risk factors among HIV/AIDS patients on HAART in Butajira, Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted, and a total of 323 study subjects was involved in the study. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select each participant during data collection. Stool specimen was collected and processed using direct wet mount, formol-ether concentration technique, and modified Ziehl-Neelson staining techniques to identify both common and opportunistic intestinal parasites. Structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic, environmental, clinical, and nutritional data. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association of various explanatory factors on intestinal parasites. P value ???0.05 at 95% CI was considered statistically significant.The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 35.9% (95% CI 31.0-40.9%). Protozoa's (Entanmoeba histolytica/dispar trophozoite, E. histolytica/dispar cyst, Giardia lamblia trophozoite, and G. lamblia cyst), helminths (Tanea species, Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloid stercoralis, Hookworm species and H. nana), and opportunistic intestinal parasites (Cryptosporidium parvum, Isospora belli) were observed in 57 (17.1%), 46 (14.4%), and 28 (8.7%) study participants respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of animals (AOR 6. 14; 95% CI 3.13, 12.0); using river water (AOR 4.87; 95% CI 1.14, 20.7); undernutrition (AOR 2.59; 95% CI 1.36-4.95); and level of immunosuppression (AOR 4.02; 95% CI 1.78-9.05 and AOR 2.84; 95% CI 1.37-5.89) were significantly associated with intestinal parasites.The prevalence of intestinal parasites found to be higher among HIV/AIDS patients receiving HAART at Butajira Hospital, southern Ethiopia. Presence of animals, using river water, lower CD4 T cell count, and undernutrition were significant factors affecting intestinal parasites. Therefore, consistent detection of intestinal parasites and deworming of patients should be performed as well as improving health education on personal hygiene, avoiding contact with pit or domestic animals, and using safe or treated water. Furthermore, improving nutritional support and household food access are recommended."
2,A century of teaching veterinary parasitology in South Africa - Lessons learnt.,"Finding a healthy balance between classical parasitology and clinical veterinary medicine remains a challenge. Veterinary parasitology, of vital interest in sub-Saharan Africa, has always featured prominently at the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria (founded in 1920). The faculty was initially an integral part of the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI), and parasitology was taught by specialist researchers from OVI - a cult of total coverage prevailed. Presenting three separate courses - ectoparasitology, helminthology and protozoology - continued for many decades. From 1949 to 1973 an attendance course in veterinary parasitology was presented in the final academic year. This was revived in 1995, with a ""refresher"" in parasitology for final-year students (during their clinic rotation), including diagnostic parasite identification and problem-solving group discussions (prepared and led by students). Student contact time (including practical classes and assessments), initially 80?€?h/discipline/year, was gradually reduced. A species-based approach (introduced in 1998) had a major impact - an introductory course in general parasitology was followed by fragmented lectures in the subsequent 2 years on key parasitic diseases in the species-based subjects. In 2013 the curriculum reverted to being discipline-based, i.e. all aspects of parasitology and parasitic diseases covered during one academic year. The 3 sub-disciplines are included in a 2-semester course, with a total contact time of 100?€?h, which barely meets the minimum recommended by the WAAVP. Various lessons learnt are discussed."
2,PCR detection of malaria parasites and related haemosporidians: the sensitive methodology in determining bird-biting insects.,"Knowledge about feeding preference of blood-sucking insects is important for the better understanding epidemiology of vector-borne parasitic diseases. Extraction of DNA from blood present in abdomens of engorged insects provides opportunities to identify species of their vertebrate hosts. However, this approach often is insufficiently sensitive due to rapid degeneration of host DNA in midguts. Recent studies indicate that avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and related haemosporidians (Haemosporida) belonging to Haemoproteus can persist both in vectors and resistant blood-sucking insects for several weeks after initial blood meals, and these parasites can be readily detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Because avian haemosporidians are cosmopolitan, prevalent and strictly specific to birds, the determination of haemosporidian DNA in blood-sucking dipterans can be used as molecular tags in determining bird-biting insects. This hypothesis was tested by investigation of prevalence of natural haemosporidian infections in wild-caught mosquitoes (Culicidae) and biting midges (Ceratopogonidae: Culicoides).Females of mosquitoes (1072 individuals of three species) and biting midges (300 individuals of three species) were collected in wildlife using simple netting. They were identified and tested individually for the presence of both the haemosporidian parasites and the bird blood using PCR-based methods. Seven different Haemoproteus and two Plasmodium lineages were detected, with overall infection prevalence of 1.12 and 1.67??% in mosquitoes and biting midges, respectively. In all, the detection rate of avian haemosporidian parasites was three fold higher compared with the detection of avian blood.Molecular markers of avian malaria parasites and other haemosporidians are recommended for getting additional knowledge about blood-sucking dipterans feeding on bird blood. Many genetic lineages of avian haemosporidians are specific to avian hosts, therefore, the detection of these parasite lineages in blood-sucking insects can indicate their feeding preferences on the level of species or groups of related bird species."
2,[Discussion on the usage of terminology of some parasites and parasitic diseases].,"According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and the Standardized Nomenclature of Animal Parasitic Diseases (SNOAPAD), and considering the new advances in parasitology, the usage of the terminology of some parasites and parasitic diseases (such as Trichinella and trichinellosis, filariae and filariasis, Echinococcus and echinococcosis, etc.) was discussed."
2,A systematic review on modelling approaches for economic losses studies caused by parasites and their associated diseases in cattle.,"Parasites reside inside or outside their hosts and get host nutrition and blood. Here, we have emphasized economic losses in cattle caused by parasitic diseases due to ecto- and endo- parasites (flies, ticks, mites and helminths). We have outlined different methods/models including economic evaluation techniques and dynamic analysis as a major class, used for the calculation of economic losses caused by parasites in cattle. According to already conducted studies, a decrease in production is mentioned in quantity and percentage while financial losses are expressed in the form of account with respect to per head, herd or for the specific study area. The parasites cause the reduced production and financial losses due to control, treatment and mortality costs. We calculated the average decrease in milk production and organ condemnation as 1.16 L animal-1 day-1 and 12.95%, respectively, from overall cattle parasitic infections. Moreover, the average calculated financial and percentage losses were US$ 50.67 animal-1 year-1 and 17.94%, respectively. Economically important parasitic diseases mentioned here are caused by specific spp. of protozoans and helminths according to data collected from the literature. Protozoan diseases include tick-borne diseases, coccidiosis, neosporosis, trypanosomiasis and cryptosporidiosis. Losses due to tick-borne infections were encountered for decreased milk production, mortality, treatment and control. Losses from coccidiosis were due to decreased weight gain, treatment costs and mortality. While abortion losses were encountered in neosporosis. Trypanosomiasis caused losses due to a decrease in milk yield. Moreover, only diagnostic (conventional or molecular techniques) cost was taken into account for cryptosporidiosis. Economically important nematode parasites are Oesophagostomum spp., Cooperia spp., Trichostrongylus spp., Strongyloides spp., Ostertagia spp. and Haemonchus placei. Due to the zoonotic importance of echinococcosis, Echinococcus granulosus is the most economically important cestode parasite. Losses caused by echinococcosis were due to organ condemnation, carcass weight loss and decreases hide value, milk production and fecundity. While, fascioliasis is one of the most economically important trematodal disease, which causes cirrhosis of the liver due to parasite migration, and thus, the organ becomes inedible. So, it would be helpful for farmers and researchers to approach these methods/models for calculation of parasitic losses and should adopt suitable measures to avoid long-term economic losses."
2,A survey of intestinal parasites including associated risk factors in humans in Panama.,"Intestinal parasitic infections are among the most common infections worldwide, leading to illness with serious and long lasting implications in children and immunocompromised people. Transmission of intestinal parasites is more frequent in tropical and sub-tropical areas where sanitation is poor and socioeconomic conditions are deficient. Panama is a country where climate and social conditions could be reflected in a high number of people infected with intestinal parasites. The presence, prevalence, and distribution of intestinal parasites in this country have been approached to date only in very restricted areas and population groups, but the impact of intestinal parasite infections at the national level is unknown.We conducted a cross-sectional survey between 2008 and 2010 to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites across Panama. Overall, 14 municipalities in seven provinces of Panama were surveyed. The presence of eggs, cysts, and larvae was assessed by microscopy in 1123 human fecal samples using a concentration technique. A questionnaire to identify risk factors associated with the frequency of intestinal parasites in the study population was also prepared and performed. Overall, 47.4% of human samples presented parasites. Variables including community type, age group, occupation, co-presence of commensals and socioeconomic factors (use of shoes and type of sanitation) were significantly associated with intestinal parasites (p<0.05).The preliminary data obtained in the current study, showing a high prevalence of fecal-oral transmitted parasites in Panama, place intestinal parasitism as a major health problem in this country. Specific interventions should be planned for the indigenous population, the group most afflicted by intestinal parasites."
2,Bibliometric analysis of scientific literature on intestinal parasites in Argentina during the period 1985-2014.,"The study of scientific production is a good indicator of the progress in research and knowledge generation. Bibliometrics is a scientific discipline that uses a set of indicators to quantitatively express the bibliographic characteristics of scientific publications. The scientific literature on the epidemiology of intestinal parasites in Argentina is scattered in numerous sources, hindering access and visibility to the scientific community. Our purpose was to perform a quantitative, bibliometric study of the scientific literature on intestinal parasites in humans in Argentina published in the period 1985-2014. This bibliometric analysis showed an increase in the number of articles on intestinal parasites in humans in Argentina published over the past 30 years. Those articles showed a collaboration index similar to that of the literature, with a high index of institutionality for national institutions and a very low one for international collaboration. The original articles were published in scientific journals in the American Continent, Europe and Asia. The use of bibliometric indicators can provide a solid tool for the diagnosis and survey of the research on epidemiology of intestinal parasites and contributes to the dissemination and visibility of information on the scientific production developed in Argentina.

2,Fighting fish parasites with photodynamically active chlorophyllin.,"Water-soluble chlorophyll (chlorophyllin) was used in a phototoxic reaction against a number of fish ectoparasites such as Ichtyobodo, Dactylogyrus, Trichodina, and Argulus. Chlorophyllin is applied to the water at concentrations of several micrograms per milliliter for a predefined incubation time, and afterwards, the parasites are exposed to simulated solar radiation. Application in the dark caused only little damage to the parasites; likewise, light exposure without the addition of the photosensitizer was ineffective. In Ichthyobodo, 2????g/mL proved sufficient with subsequent simulated solar radiation to almost quantitatively kill the parasites, while in Dactylogyrus, a concentration of about 6????g/mL was necessary. The LD50 value for this parasite was 1.02????g/mL. Trichodina could be almost completely eliminated at 2????g/mL. Only in the parasitic crustacean Argulus, no killing could be achieved by a photodynamic reaction using chlorophyllin. Chlorophyllin is non-toxic, biodegradable, and can be produced at low cost. Therefore, we propose that chlorophyllin (or other photodynamic substances) are a possible effective countermeasure against several ectoparasites in ponds and aquaculture since chemical remedies are either forbidden and/or ineffective. "
2,"Human Parasites in Medieval Europe: Lifestyle, Sanitation and Medical Treatment.","Parasites have been infecting humans throughout our evolution. However, not all people suffered with the same species or to the same intensity throughout this time. Our changing way of life has altered the suitability of humans to infection by each type of parasite. This analysis focuses upon the evidence for parasites from archaeological excavations at medieval sites across Europe. Comparison between the patterns of infection in the medieval period allows us to see how changes in sanitation, herding animals, growing and fertilizing crops, the fishing industry, food preparation and migration all affected human susceptibility to different parasites. We go on to explore how ectoparasites may have spread infectious bacterial diseases, and also consider what medieval medical practitioners thought of parasites and how they tried to treat them. While modern research has shown the use of a toilet decreases the risk of contracting certain intestinal parasites, the evidence for past societies presented here suggests that the invention of latrines had no observable beneficial effects upon intestinal health. This may be because toilets were not sufficiently ubiquitous until the last century, or that the use of fresh human faeces for manuring crops still ensured those parasite species were easily able to reinfect the population. "
2,Ancient DNA from latrines in Northern Europe and the Middle East (500 BC-1700 AD) reveals past parasites and diet.,"High-resolution insight into parasitic infections and diet of past populations in Northern Europe and the Middle East (500 BC- 1700 AD) was obtained by pre-concentration of parasite eggs from ancient latrines and deposits followed by shotgun sequencing of DNA. Complementary profiling of parasite, vertebrate and plant DNA proved highly informative in the study of ancient health, human-animal interactions as well as animal and plant dietary components. Most prominent were finding of soil-borne parasites transmitted directly between humans, but also meat-borne parasites that require consumption of raw or undercooked fish and pork. The detection of parasites for which sheep, horse, dog, pig, and rodents serves as definitive hosts are clear markers of domestic and synanthropic animals living in closer proximity of the respective sites. Finally, the reconstruction of full mitochondrial parasite genomes from whipworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) and roundworm species (Trichuris trichiura and Trichuris muris) and estimates of haplotype frequencies elucidates the genetic diversity and provides insights into epidemiology and parasite biology."
2,Highly effective and inexpensive parasitological technique for diagnosis of intestinal parasites in developing countries: spontaneous sedimentation technique in tube.,"Millions of low-income people in the world are affected by intestinal parasites. Inexpensive, simple, and effective techniques for diagnosis are necessary. The spontaneous sedimentation technique in tube (SSTT), for application in poor healthcare settings and under field-work conditions, was described 25 years ago in Peru by Tello. The advantages of the SSTT are its ability to detect the majority of intestinal parasites, including eggs, larvae, cysts, and trophozoites, and its low cost."
2,The evolutionary ecology of complex lifecycle parasites: linking phenomena with mechanisms.,"Many parasitic infections, including those of humans, are caused by complex lifecycle parasites (CLPs): parasites that sequentially infect different hosts over the course of their lifecycle. CLPs come from a wide range of taxonomic groups-from single-celled bacteria to multicellular flatworms-yet share many common features in their life histories. Theory tells us when CLPs should be favoured by selection, but more empirical studies are required in order to quantify the costs and benefits of having a complex lifecycle, especially in parasites that facultatively vary their lifecycle complexity. In this article, we identify ecological conditions that favour CLPs over their simple lifecycle counterparts and highlight how a complex lifecycle can alter transmission rate and trade-offs between growth and reproduction. We show that CLPs participate in dynamic host-parasite coevolution, as more mobile hosts can fuel CLP adaptation to less mobile hosts. Then, we argue that a more general understanding of the evolutionary ecology of CLPs is essential for the development of effective frameworks to manage the many diseases they cause. More research is needed identifying the genetics of infection mechanisms used by CLPs, particularly into the role of gene duplication and neofunctionalisation in lifecycle evolution. We propose that testing for signatures of selection in infection genes will reveal much about how and when complex lifecycles evolved, and will help quantify complex patterns of coevolution between CLPs and their various hosts. Finally, we emphasise four key areas where new research approaches will provide fertile opportunities to advance this field. "
2,The American mink (Neovison vison) is a competent host for native European parasites.,"The American mink (Neovison vison) is a mustelid native to North America that was introduced in Europe and the former USSR for fur farming. Throughout the last century, accidental or deliberate escapes of mink from farms caused the establishment of stable feral populations. In fact, the American mink is considered an invasive alien species in 28 European countries. The present study evaluates the gastrointestinal and cardiopulmonary helminth fauna of the American mink in Galicia (NW Spain) to understand its role as a potential reservoir for parasites affecting other autochthonous mustelids. In the period 2008-2014, fifty American mink (35 males and 15 females) of different ages (22 immature and 28 adults) from the provinces of Lugo, Ourense and Pontevedra were captured and sacrificed. Eight parasite species were found (6 nematodes and 2 trematodes) with the following prevalences: Molineus patens (68%), Aonchotheca putorii (54%), Crenosoma melesi (10%), Aonchotheca annulosa (8%), Angiostrongylus daskalovi (6%), Aelurostrongylus spp. (2%), Troglotrema acutum (2%) and an unidentified trematode (2%). Eighty-two per cent of the mink harboured helminths, including 15 animals (30%) infected by only one parasite species, 19 (38%) by two species, 5 (10%) by three species and 2 mink (4%) by four species. All helminth species identified are native to European mustelids. Statistical models were used to evaluate if animal characteristics (age, sex and weight), date and capture area influenced the prevalence, intensity or parasite richness. Statistical differences were detected only in models for intensity of M. patens, A. putorii and C. melesi. This is the first report of Angiostrongylus daskalovi, a cardiopulmonary nematode, and A. annulosa, a gastrointestinal nematode specific of rodents, in American mink. Moreover, although the fluke T. acutum has already been cited in American mink, to our knowledge, the present study represents the first report of this trematode in the lung."
2,Diagnostic challenges and the unwritten stories of dog and cat parasites.,"Is it still possible to discover new parasites of dogs and cats? Do we really know enough about them? To what extent do limitations in the diagnosis of dog and cat parasites represent an obstacle for a deeper understanding of their biology? Diagnosis in parasitology has a profound impact on animal health and welfare and, in some cases, public health. Although, over the last few years, advances in the diagnosis of parasitic diseases have largely paralleled knowledge of their biology, gaps in the diagnosis of cat and dog parasites still exist. For instance, difficulties in obtaining samples for research purposes (due to ethical issues or to the invasive nature of the sampling procedures), inappropriate sample storage and poor sensitivity of the commonly used techniques, may represent major obstacles in diagnosing parasitic diseases. Other hurdles are often associated with the biology of parasites (e.g., the intermittent presence in blood of tick-borne pathogens) or, simply, through the fact that some parasites of pets are largely ignored by the scientific community. This article provides key examples of parasites of dogs and cats, which are currently considered of minor importance, also because of the limitations in their diagnosis. Among them, new or, in some cases, previously ""misdiagnosed parasites"" with overlapping morphological features, biology or ecology, represent a major challenge when trying to correctly diagnose ""unknown parasites"" (for which only occasional reports are available). Further research is needed in order to provide the scientific community with more reliable, cost-effective diagnostic tools, which ultimately, will assist our understanding of some mis- or less-diagnosed parasitoses. "
2,Fish Parasites: A Growing Concern During Pregnancy.,"Intestinal parasitic worms affect more than 2 billion people worldwide according to the World Health Organization. Fish-borne parasitic infections are becoming more common with the increasing popularity of sushi, sashimi, Carpaccio, tartare, gefilte, and ceviche. The ingestion of these parasites can cause serve anemia, malabsorption, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, strong allergic reactions, and gastric ulcers. Knowledge about fish parasites and pregnancy is limited. A literature search on PubMed and Web of Science used the search terms ""fish parasites"" OR ""diphyllobothrium"" OR ""anisakiasis"" OR ""pseudoterranova"" OR (""food borne parasites"" AND ""fish"") AND ""pregnancy"" OR ""maternal"" OR ""fetus"" OR ""fetal"" OR ""newborn"" OR ""neonatal"" OR ""childbirth."" No limit was put on the number of years searched. There were 281 publications identified. The abstracts of all of these publications were read. After exclusion of the articles that were not relevant to pregnancy, pregnancy outcome, and fish parasites, there were 24 articles that became the basis of this review. The pathophysiology, altered maternal immunity related to the infection, limited information about fish-borne parasitic infections and pregnancy, and treatments are discussed. The main impact of a fish-borne parasitic infection on pregnant women is anemia and altered immunity, which may increase the risk of a maternal infection. The primary fetal effects include intrauterine growth restriction and preterm delivery. "
2,Gaining insights into the ecological role of the New Zealand sole (Peltorhamphus novaezeelandiae) through parasites.,"Despite the fact that tapeworms comprise the bulk of parasite communities of sharks in marine ecosystems, little is known about their life cycles and, more specifically, about the potential intermediate hosts they utilize as transmission routes. In the absence of morphological features required for specific identification of larval tapeworms from potential intermediate hosts, recent molecular advances have contributed to linking larval and adult parasites and, in some instances, uncovering unknown trophic links. Host-parasite checklists are often the first source of information consulted to assess the diversity and host specificity of parasites, and provide insights into parasite identification. However, these host-parasite checklists are only useful if they encompass the full spectrum of associations between hosts and parasites. A checklist of New Zealand fishes and their parasites has been published, but recent parasitological examinations of commercial fish species reveal that the checklist appears to be far from complete. We focused our current study on a comprehensive survey of macroparasites of a commercial species, the New Zealand sole (Peltorhamphus novaezeelandiae) off the coast of Otago, New Zealand. Specifically, we were expecting to recover marine tapeworms using sharks as their definitive hosts that are generally underreported in parasite surveys. The parasites recovered included tapeworms, flukes, round worms and thorny-headed worms. Surprisingly, a large proportion of the non-tapeworm parasites we recovered were not previously reported from this fish species. A discussion on the potential ecological roles played by this fish species in the transmission of parasites is included."
2,"Risk factors associated with intestinal parasitic infections among inmates of Kisii prison, Kisii county, Kenya.","Intestinal parasitic infections are a major health problem worldwide. In Kenya intestinal parasitic infections are highly prevalent especially in prisons due to poor and/or inadequate infrastructure. The aim of this study was to establish the risk factors associated with intestinal parasites infection among inmates of Kisii prison, Kisii county, Kenya.Fresh stool samples of 384 inmates in Kisii prison aged 20??years and above, were screened for intestinal parasitic infections between February and August 2015. Stool samples were processed using direct fecal smear and formol-ether sedimentation techniques for confirmation then they were examined microscopically. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to establish the relationship of various factors and practices with the occurrence of intestinal parasites. The differences were considered statistically significant at P??<??0.05.Of the 384 inmates screened, 95 (24.7??%) were infected with one or more intestinal parasites. Of the positive inmates, 58 (15.1??%) were infected with one species of protozoa while 24 (5.2??%) were infected with at least one species of helminthes and 13 (3.5??%) had mixed infections of species of intestinal parasites. Washing of hands before meals and after visiting toilets significantly reduced risk of infections (P??<??0.05). The level of education was inversely related to the risk of intestinal parasites infection where by inmates at post primary education were least infected with intestinal parasites infection as compared to unschooled inmates (P??<??0.05). Wearing of shoes was seen to significantly reduce parasitic infections (P???????0.05). Duties assigned to inmates did not significantly determine the risk of intestinal parasitic infection (P??>??0.05). Male inmates had significantly more intestinal parasites infections 57 (21.8??%) compared to females 28 (8.1??%) (P??<??0.05). Inmates within ages 20-29??years were more infected (11.3??%) compared to the age group of??>60??years (0.6??%) (P??<??0.05). There was no statistical significant difference between the number of infections among the length of the jail terms (P??<??0.05).Prevalence of intestinal parasites was high among inmates in the study area than the general population. Practices like wearing of shoes, washing of hands before meals after visiting a toilet and level of education affect the spread of the infections."
2,"Prevalence of intestinal parasites in HIV-positive patients on the island of Bioko, Equatorial Guinea: its relation to sanitary conditions and socioeconomic factors.","The prevalence of intestinal parasitic diseases and their associated factors has been investigated in HIV populations from the Island of Bioko, Equatorial Guinea. The feces of 310 participants from the island of Bioko (260 HIV-positive and 50 HIV-negative) were analyzed by microscopic observation. Immunochromatography was also used to diagnose Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptosporidium spp. In addition, patients were asked for sociodemographic, economic and academic status, and CD4+ T cell counts were recorded. For HIV-positive patients, the prevalence of infection by intestinal parasites was 81.5% (212/260), 83.8% (218/260) by pathogenic helminths and 55.4% (168/260) by pathogenic protozoa (E. histolytica/dispar and Giardia duodenalis). Gender association was found between the infection by Ascaris and Schistosoma, a higher proportion being found in women; and between Entamoeba and the place of residence, a higher proportion being observed in the urban belt. Strongyloides stercoralis and Chilomastix mesnili appeared only in the people of this group, all the cases of Chilomastix being in females. For HIV-negative participants, the prevalence of infection by intestinal parasites was 74.0% (37/50), 90.0% (45/50) by pathogenic helminths and 66.0% (43/50) by pathogenic protozoa. Gender, educational level and low hygiene were associated with intestinal parasitic infection. When comparing the two groups (HIV-positive and HIV-negative), statistical association between HIV co-infection and infection by Giardia and Entamoeba was found. Diarrhea was also associated with intestinal parasitic infection in the HIV-positive group. Not only do our findings reflect high rates of intestinal parasitic infections in HIV-positive people, but also in the HIV-negative group, suggesting a closer relationship between sanitary status and living conditions than with immune status, and thus they highlight the need to carry out health education policies in the population. In addition, Schistosoma intercalatum/guineensis has been detected for the first time as an autochthonous parasite on the island."
2,Intestinal parasitic diarrhea among children in Baghdad--Iraq.,"Parasitic diarrhea among children is a significant health problem worldwide. This cross sectional study described the burden of parasitic diarrhea among children. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of risk factors on the parasitic diarrhea, and to determine the parasitic profile among children in Baghdad-Iraq, during the period extending from September 2003 to June 2004. A total number of 2033 cases were included in the study. The estimated prevalence rate of parasitic diarrhea was 22%. We identified the following major diarrhea determinants were large households size, residential location, water source, low socioeconomic status, and low parent education. Giardia lamblia was found to be the most prevalent parasite with an infection rate of 45.54% followed by Entamoeba histolytica 23.44%, Enterobius vermicularis 12.7%, Hymenolepis nana 9.82%, Trichuris trichiura 5.4%, and Ascaris lumbricoides 2.2%. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that poor sanitation, inadequate environmental conditions, and low socioeconomic status are the main determining factors that predispose children to parasitic diarrhea. Mass deworming programs are recommended for school children, as this population is easily accessible. "
2,Flagellar motility in eukaryotic human parasites.,"A huge variety of protists rely on one or more motile flagella to either move themselves or move fluids and substances around them. Many of these flagellates have evolved a symbiotic or parasitic lifestyle. Several of the parasites have adapted to human hosts, and include agents of prevalent and serious diseases. These unicellular parasites have become specialised in colonising a wide range of biological niches within humans. They usually have diverse transmission cycles, and frequently manifest a variety of distinct morphological stages. The motility of the single or multiple flagella plays important but understudied roles in parasite transmission, host invasion, dispersal, survival, proliferation and pathology. In this review we provide an overview of the important human pathogens that possess a motile flagellum for at least part of their life cycle. We highlight recently published studies that aim to elucidate motility mechanisms, and their relevance for human disease. We then bring the physics of swimming at the microscale into context, emphasising the importance of interdisciplinary approaches for a full understanding of flagellate motility - especially in light of the parasites' microenvironments and population dynamics. Finally, we summarise some important technological aspects, describing challenges for the field and possibilities for motility analyses in the future. "
2,Environmental Parasitology: intestinal helminth parasites of the siganid fish Siganus rivulatus as bioindicators for trace metal pollution in the Red Sea.,"Studies on host-parasite systems as bioindicators for monitoring trace metal pollution in marine environments are still scarce. Here, 11, 14 and 17 infrapopulations of Gyliauchen volubilis (Trematoda: Digenea), Procamallanus elatensis (Nematoda) and Sclerocollum rubrimaris (Acanthocephala), respectively, were collected from the fish Siganus rivulatus (Siganidae) in the Red Sea, from a chronically polluted small bay at Sharm El-Sheikh, South Sinai, Egypt. Water and sediment samples from the bay, tissue samples (intestines, liver, and muscle) from each fish, and samples from each parasite were taken for heavy metal analyses of cadmium and lead. Cadmium concentrations in intestines, liver and muscle of non-infected and infected fishes were much lower than those of lead, and both metal concentrations decreased in the order: liver??>??intestines??>??muscle. Cadmium and lead concentrations in the tissues of fishes infected with G. volubilis or P. elatensis were slightly lower than those in non-infected ones, while in the tissues of fishes infected with Sc. rubrimaris, they were much lower. Low concentrations of cadmium and lead in G. volubilis and P. elatensis are associated with their limited ability or capacity to accumulate trace metals. Therefore, bioconcentration factors corresponding to these species were relatively low, and both are herein considered as weak bioindicators. By contrast, high concentrations of cadmium and lead in S. rubrimaris are associated with its high ability to accumulate trace metals. Of the present three host-parasite systems, only the Siganus rivulatus-Sclerocollum rubrimaris system seems to be promising for biomonitoring of metal pollution in the Red Sea."
2,Parasites and asthma.,"Nowadays, many studies have found low morbidity of asthma in epidemic areas of parasitic diseases, as shown by the hygiene hypothesis. It is obvious that some parasite infections can prevent asthma and studies have been carried out to clarify the mechanism of the preventive effect and search for the future asthmatic therapies. Previous findings have indicated that this mechanism may be related to the immune response switching from Th1 to Th2 and important cells induced by parasites, including the regulatory T cells, regulatory B cells, dendrite cells, and alternatively activated macrophages. Cytokine IL-10 also plays a nonredundant role in protection against allergic airway inflammation in asthma. This review focuses on the relationship between parasites and asthma, and the potential protection mechanism involved."
2,Genome mining offers a new starting point for parasitology research.,"Parasites including helminthes, protozoa, and medical arthropod vectors are a major cause of global infectious diseases, affecting one-sixth of the world's population, which are responsible for enormous levels of morbidity and mortality important and remain impediments to economic development especially in tropical countries. Prevalent drug resistance, lack of highly effective and practical vaccines, as well as specific and sensitive diagnostic markers are proving to be challenging problems in parasitic disease control in most parts of the world. The impressive progress recently made in genome-wide analysis of parasites of medical importance, including trematodes of Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini, Schistosoma haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni; nematodes of Brugia malayi, Loa loa, Necator americanus, Trichinella spiralis, and Trichuris suis; cestodes of Echinococcus granulosus, E. multilocularis, and Taenia solium; protozoa of Babesia bovis, B. microti, Cryptosporidium hominis, Eimeria falciformis, E. histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Leishmania braziliensis, L. donovani, L. major, Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, Trichomonas vaginalis, Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi; and medical arthropod vectors of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles darlingi, A. sinensis, and Culex quinquefasciatus, have been systematically covered in this review for a comprehensive understanding of the genetic information contained in nuclear, mitochondrial, kinetoplast, plastid, or endosymbiotic bacterial genomes of parasites, further valuable insight into parasite-host interactions and development of promising novel drug and vaccine candidates and preferable diagnostic tools, thereby underpinning the prevention and control of parasitic diseases."
2,Two's a crowd? Crowding effect in a parasitic castrator drives differences in reproductive resource allocation in single vs double infections.,"The 'crowding effect' is a result of competition by parasites within a host for finite resources. Typically, the severity of this effect increases with increasing numbers of parasites within a host and manifests in reduced body size and thus fitness. Evidence for the crowding effect is mixed - while some have found negative effects, others have found a positive effect of increased parasite load on parasite fitness. Parasites are consumers with diverse trophic strategies reflected in their life history traits. These distinctions are useful to predict the effects of crowding. We studied a parasitic castrator, a parasite that usurps host reproductive energy and renders the host sterile. Parasitic castrators typically occur as single infections within hosts. With multiple parasitic castrators, we expect strong competition and evidence of crowding. We directly assess the effect of crowding on reproductive success in a barnacle population infected by a unique parasitic castrator, Hemioniscus balani, an isopod parasite that infects and blocks reproduction of barnacles. We find (1) strong evidence of crowding in double infections, (2) increased frequency of double infections in larger barnacle hosts with more resources and (3) perfect compensation in egg production, supporting strong space limitation. Our results document that the effects of crowding are particularly severe for this parasitic castrator, and may be applicable to other castrators that are also resource or space limited."
2,IgE and mast cells in host defense against parasites and venoms.,"IgE-dependent mast cell activation is a major effector mechanism underlying the pathology associated with allergic disorders. The most dramatic of these IgE-associated disorders is the fatal anaphylaxis which can occur in some people who have developed IgE antibodies to otherwise innocuous antigens, such as those contained in certain foods and medicines. Why would such a highly ""maladaptive"" immune response develop in evolution and be retained to the present day? Host defense against parasites has long been considered the only beneficial function that might be conferred by IgE and mast cells. However, recent studies have provided evidence that, in addition to participating in host resistance to certain parasites, mast cells and IgE are critical components of innate (mast cells) and adaptive (mast cells and IgE) immune responses that can enhance host defense against the toxicity of certain arthropod and animal venoms, including enhancing the survival of mice injected with such venoms. Yet, in some people, developing IgE antibodies to insect or snake venoms puts them at risk for having a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction upon subsequent exposure to such venoms. Delineating the mechanisms underlying beneficial versus detrimental innate and adaptive immune responses associated with mast cell activation and IgE is likely to enhance our ability to identify potential therapeutic targets in such settings, not only for reducing the pathology associated with allergic disorders but perhaps also for enhancing immune protection against pathogens and animal venoms."
2,"Formalin-ethyl acetate concentration, FLOTAC Pellet and anal swab techniques for the diagnosis of intestinal parasites.","The aim of this study was to compare formalin-ethyl acetate concentration and FLOTAC Pellet techniques for the diagnosis of intestinal parasites in human stool samples. The anal swab method was used for the specific detection of Enterobius vermicularis. The study was performed in children and youth from Puerto Madryn (South Argentina). A total of 174 individuals were examined using the formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT), the FLOTAC Pellet technique with saturated sodium chloride and zinc sulphate flotation solutions and anal swabs. The performance of copromicroscopic techniques was evaluated according to sensitivity, negative predictive value and Kappa index. Overall, 39.1% of the individuals were parasitised. The most prevalent species was Blastocystis sp. (19%) followed by E. vermicularis (17.8%), Giardia lamblia (6.3%), Entamoeba coli (5.7%), Hymenolepis nana and Endolimax nana (1.1%). The FECT was the most sensitive technique for Blastocystis sp., G. lamblia and E. coli infections, whereas FLOTAC Pellet techniques were the most sensitive for H. nana diagnosis. Anal swabs detected the highest percentage of E. vermicularis infection. This was the first time that the FLOTAC Pellet technique was used to detect intestinal parasites in humans. The FECT continues to be a reliable method for detecting protozoa and the FLOTAC Pellet technique gains importance in the diagnosis of helminths. Anal swab test remains the method of choice for the detection of E. vermicularis. However, when comparing techniques, key factors as preservation methods, preservation times and flotation solutions should be taken into account."
2,"Urban Dog Parks as Sources of Canine Parasites: Contamination Rates and Pet Owner Behaviours in Lisbon, Portugal.","Dog parks represent a recent trend in western countries, enabling owners to spend quality time with their pets in a controlled environment. Despite their growing popularity, few studies have been performed to date on these parks to investigate dog intestinal parasitic infections and soil contamination. The present study examined 369 faecal and 18 soil samples collected from 3 dog parks in Greater Lisbon, Portugal. Additionally, 102 interviews were performed with dog owners to assess dog-walking behaviours and parasite risk. In total, 33% of the faecal dog samples were infected with at least one parasitic agent: hookworms (16.5%), <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. (11.9%), <i>Giardia</i> spp. (11.4%), <i>Toxascaris leonina</i> (1.1%), <i>Cystoisospora</i> spp. (1.1%), <i>Toxocara</i> spp. (0.5%), and <i>Sarcocystis</i> sp. (0.3%). The soil of all the parks was contaminated with hookworm eggs. This is the first study performed in a European urban area to assess canine faecal contamination and parasitic agents in dog parks. Our results highlight the potential of these parks as a source of transmission for canine parasites, including some with zoonotic potential. Public awareness and effective preventive measures should be promoted to minimise the health-risk impact to both animals and humans, under the scope of environmental and public health."
2,Analysis of a summary network of co-infection in humans reveals that parasites interact most via shared resources.,"Simultaneous infection by multiple parasite species (viruses, bacteria, helminths, protozoa or fungi) is commonplace. Most reports show co-infected humans to have worse health than those with single infections. However, we have little understanding of how co-infecting parasites interact within human hosts. We used data from over 300 published studies to construct a network that offers the first broad indications of how groups of co-infecting parasites tend to interact. The network had three levels comprising parasites, the resources they consume and the immune responses they elicit, connected by potential, observed and experimentally proved links. Pairs of parasite species had most potential to interact indirectly through shared resources, rather than through immune responses or other parasites. In addition, the network comprised 10 tightly knit groups, eight of which were associated with particular body parts, and seven of which were dominated by parasite-resource links. Reported co-infection in humans is therefore structured by physical location within the body, with bottom-up, resource-mediated processes most often influencing how, where and which co-infecting parasites interact. The many indirect interactions show how treating an infection could affect other infections in co-infected patients, but the compartmentalized structure of the network will limit how far these indirect effects are likely to spread. "
2,Morphological re-description and new geographical records for three digenean parasites infecting African sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus (Pisces: Clariidae) in Egypt.,"Sixty specimens of African sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus (Clariidae) were collected during the period of March 2014-February 2015 from boat landing sites and fishermen of the River Nile at Beni Suef Governorate, Egypt, and examined for the presence of digenean parasites. The morphology of these parasites was studied by using light microscopy to describe morphological and morphometrically measurements for different body parts. Three digenean species belonging to three different genera were collected from various organs within the examined fish species. A certain degree of site specificity was also observed, with Thaparotrema botswanensis being found only in the gall bladder of C. gariepinus, while both Pseudoholorchis clarii and Glossidium pedatum were found only in the intestine and thus seem to occupy a certain niche within their host. This study represent as the first record of T. botswanensis and G. pedatum from C. gariepinus, as well as the first report of the genera from the River Nile in Egypt. In addition, re-description of P. clarii clarifies measurements for some body parts."
2,Impairment of T cell function in parasitic infections.,"In mammals subverted as hosts by protozoan parasites, the latter and/or the agonists they release are detected and processed by sensors displayed by many distinct immune cell lineages, in a tissue(s)-dependent context. Focusing on the T lymphocyte lineage, we review our present understanding on its transient or durable functional impairment over the course of the developmental program of the intracellular parasites Leishmania spp., Plasmodium spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Trypanosoma cruzi in their mammalian hosts. Strategies employed by protozoa to down-regulate T lymphocyte function may act at the initial moment of na??ve T cell priming, rendering T cells anergic or unresponsive throughout infection, or later, exhausting T cells due to antigen persistence. Furthermore, by exploiting host feedback mechanisms aimed at maintaining immune homeostasis, parasites can enhance T cell apoptosis. We will discuss how infections with prominent intracellular protozoan parasites lead to a general down-regulation of T cell function through T cell anergy and exhaustion, accompanied by apoptosis, and ultimately allowing pathogen persistence. "
2,microRNAs in parasites and parasite infection.,"miRNAs, a subclass of small regulatory RNAs, are present from ancient unicellular protozoans to parasitic helminths and parasitic arthropods. The miRNA-silencing mechanism appears, however, to be absent in a number of protozoan parasites. Protozoan miRNAs and components of their silencing machinery possess features different from other eukaryotes, providing some clues on the evolution of the RNA-induced silencing machinery. miRNA functions possibly associate with neoblast biology, development, physiology, infection and immunity of parasites. Parasite infection can alter host miRNA expression that can favor both parasite clearance and infection. miRNA pathways are, thus, a potential target for the therapeutic control of parasitic diseases.

2,"Intestinal parasites and lungworms in stray, shelter and privately owned cats of Switzerland.","Endoparasitic infections represent relevant causes of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in cats. The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence of endoparasites in Swiss cats in order to evaluate the risk of onset of parasitic diseases and potential correlated zoonoses. Therefore 664 faecal samples from privately owned (n?€?=?€?299), shelter (n?€?=?€?197) and stray (n?€?=?€?168) cats were investigated by sedimentation-flotation and 468 samples additionally by the Baermann technique. Overall, 77.4% (n?€?=?€?130), 21.8% (n?€?=?€?43) and 11.7% (n?€?=?€?35) of stray, shelter and privately owned cats, respectively, were positive, with significant differences between the groups. Among infected cats, 58.7% (n?€?=?€?122) harboured a single, 30.8% (n?€?=?€?64) two and 10.6% (n?€?=?€?22) more than two parasite species. Toxocara cati, with an infection rate of 18.5% (n?€?=?€?123), was the most frequently detected parasite. The rates for other intestinal parasites were: Taenia sp. 11.1% (n?€?=?€?74), Isospora sp. 8.1% (n?€?=?€?54), Capillaria sp. 4.7% (n?€?=?€?31), hookworms 1.1% (n?€?=?€?7), Giardia duodenalis 0.8% (n?€?=?€?5), Dipylidium caninum 0.6% (n?€?=?€?4), Toxoplasma gondii 0.6% (n?€?=?€?4), Hammondia hammondi 0.5% (n?€?=?€?3), Sarcocystis sp. 0.2% (n?€?=?€?1) and Diphyllobothrium latum 0.2% (n?€?=?€?1). First-stage larvae of the lungworm Aelurostrongylus abstrusus were found in 2.3% (n?€?=?€?15) of all samples. The morphological identification of Taenia sp., T. gondii, H. hammondi and A. abstrusus was confirmed by molecular techniques. Overall, cats younger than one year and intact animals were more frequently infected with parasites than older and neutered animals. The observed infection rates were comparable to those from other European studies, except for Taenia sp. showing a significantly higher occurrence. This implicates that there is a persistent risk of environmental contamination with parasitic stages especially by stray cats, and a risk of infection for cat owners with potential zoonotic pathogens, emphasizing the need for appropriate parasite control measures."
2,Parasites and vector-borne pathogens in client-owned dogs in Albania. Blood pathogens and seroprevalences of parasitic and other infectious agents.,"Knowledge on the epidemiology of parasitic and vector-borne infections is still very limited for Albania, a country located in the Balkan Peninsula in southeast Europe. Recent publications indicated prevalence rates of up to 52% for vector-borne infections in less-cared dogs in Albania. To provide data on the epidemiological situation in dogs under veterinary care, a total of 602 client-owned dogs presented to four small animal clinics between March 2010 and April 2011 in Tirana, Albania, were screened by examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears, PCR, and serological methods for the presence of arthropod-borne infections, as well as Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii. Eight different pathogens, namely Babesia vogeli, Hepatozoon canis, Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia canis, and Mycoplasma haemocanis, were detected by direct methods with prevalence rates ranging from 1 to 9%. Seroprevalence for Babesia spp., L. infantum, Anaplasma spp., and E. canis were 6.6, 5.1, 24.1, and 20.8%, respectively. Dogs >1 year of age were positive for vector-borne infections significantly more often than younger dogs (p?€?=?€?0.003). More than half (51.7%) of the dogs were seroreactive to T. gondii and 18.3% to N. caninum. This is the first report on the detection of A. phagocytophilum, A. platys, E. canis, and M. haemocanis by PCR as well as the serological confirmation of exposure of dogs to N. caninum and T. gondii in Albania. The spectrum of pathogens and the seroprevalences for N. caninum and T. gondii in client-owned dogs from Tirana, Albania, are comparable to that reported in other countries in the Mediterranean Basin. The prevalence rates of vector-borne pathogens are at the lower range of that reported in studies from this geographical region. This is probably due to increased awareness of the owners of pet dogs, including better husbandry conditions and ectoparasiticidal treatment, thus limiting exposure of dogs to vectors."
2,Novel application of species richness estimators to predict the host range of parasites.,"Host range is a critical life history trait of parasites, influencing prevalence, virulence and ultimately determining their distributional extent. Current approaches to measure host range are sensitive to sampling effort, the number of known hosts increasing with more records. Here, we develop a novel application of results-based stopping rules to determine how many hosts should be sampled to yield stable estimates of the number of primary hosts within regions, then use species richness estimation to predict host ranges of parasites across their distributional ranges. We selected three mistletoe species (hemiparasitic plants in the Loranthaceae) to evaluate our approach: a strict host specialist (Amyema lucasii, dependent on a single host species), an intermediate species (Amyema quandang, dependent on hosts in one genus) and a generalist (Lysiana exocarpi, dependent on many genera across multiple families), comparing results from geographically-stratified surveys against known host lists derived from herbarium specimens. The results-based stopping rule (stop sampling bioregion once observed host richness exceeds 80% of the host richness predicted using the Abundance-based Coverage Estimator) worked well for most bioregions studied, being satisfied after three to six sampling plots (each representing 25 host trees) but was unreliable in those bioregions with high host richness or high proportions of rare hosts. Although generating stable predictions of host range with minimal variation among six estimators trialled, distribution-wide estimates fell well short of the number of hosts known from herbarium records. This mismatch, coupled with the discovery of nine previously unrecorded mistletoe-host combinations, further demonstrates the limited ecological relevance of simple host-parasite lists. By collecting estimates of host range of constrained completeness, our approach maximises sampling efficiency while generating comparable estimates of the number of primary hosts, with broad applicability to many host-parasite systems."
2,"Prevalence and factors associated with intestinal parasites among food handlers of food and drinking establishments in Aksum Town, Northern Ethiopia.","Various epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of intestinal parasites is high in developing countries and those parasites are major public health importance in Sub-Saharan Africa. Their distribution is mainly associated with poor personal hygiene, environmental sanitation and lack of access to clean water. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection and identify factors associated with intestinal parasitic infection among food handlers in the Aksum Town of Tigray Regional State, North Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study design was used among 400 randomly selected food handlers who were selected as respondents. Data were collected by face to face interviewer administered questionnaire supplemented with observational checklist. Fresh stool samples were collected from respondents and were examined microscopically for the presence of any of intestinal parasites using standard laboratory methods. Multivariable logistic regression model using Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was fitted to analyze the independent predictors of intestinal parasitic infections.The mean age of the food handlers included in this study was 26.0??years. Of the total respondents, 72.5% were females, 63% have completed at least secondary school educational level. Five species of Intestinal Parasites (IPs) were identified. The overall prevalence of being infected with at least one intestinal parasite was 14.5%, 95% CI (11.3, 18.0). The odds of being positive for at least one intestinal parasitic infection was 12.3 times higher among food handlers who practice medical checkup every 9 months compared to those who have a medical checkup every 3 months. The odds of being positive for intestinal parasitic infection was 3 times higher among food handlers with no formal education compared to those who have a level of education secondary school and above. Food handlers who received food hygiene and safety training were 66% less likely to be positive for at least one intestinal parasitic infection as compared to those who did not receive training.Prevalence of parasitic infection among food handlers observed in the current study is relatively low but is still a public health importance. Number of medical checkup, training in food hygiene and safety, feedback from customers and level of education were significantly associated with reduced odds of being infected with parasitic infection. Hence, these factors should be focused by policy makers and implementers to further bring the prevalence below the level of public health importance."
2,"Community ecology of parasites in four species of Corydoras (Callichthyidae), ornamental fish endemic to the eastern Amazon (Brazil).","This study compared the parasites community in Corydoras ephippifer, Corydoras melanistius, Corydoras amapaensis and Corydoras spilurus from tributaries from the Amapari River in State of Amap?? (Brazil). A total of 151 fish of these four ornamental species were examined, of which 66.2% were parasitized by one or more species, and a total of 732 parasites were collected. Corydoras ephippifer (91.2%) and C. spilurus (98.8%) were the most parasitized hosts, while C. amapaensis (9.6%) was the least parasitized. A high similarity (??? 75%) of parasite communities was found in the host species. Hosts were parasitized by Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus, Camallanus sp. and metacercariae of digeneans. The parasites had an aggregated dispersion pattern, but in C. ephippifer a random dispersion of P. (S.) inopinatus was found. The parasite community was characterized by a low species richness (1-4 parasites per host), low diversity and low evenness, and consisted mainly of endoparasites with high prevalence and low abundance. An important component in the determination of the helminth parasite community composition was the dominance of species that use these fish species as secondary intermediate or paratenic hosts. This was the first study on the parasite community for these four hosts. A checklist of parasite species in wild populations of Corydoras spp. from different localities was also reported here."
2,Understanding the role of parasites in food webs using the group model.,"Parasites are ubiquitous and have been shown to influence macroscopic measures of ecological network structure, such as connectance and robustness, as well as local structure, such as subgraph frequencies. Nevertheless, they are often under-represented in ecological studies due to their small size and often complex life cycles. We consider whether or not parasites play structurally unique roles in ecological networks; that is, can we distinguish parasites from other species using network structure alone? We partition the species in a community statistically using the group model, and we test whether or not parasites tend to cluster in their own groups, using a measure of ""imbalance."" We find that parasites form highly imbalanced groups, and that concomitant predation, in which a predator consumes a prey and its parasites, but not the number of interactions, improves the group model's ability to distinguish parasites from non-parasites. This work demonstrates that parasites and non-parasites interact in networks in statistically distinct ways, and that these differences are partly, but not entirely, due to the existence of concomitant predation."
2,"Veterinary parasitology teaching in China in the 21st century - Challenges, opportunities and perspectives.","China has made significant achievements in social-economic development in the last three decades, and the numbers of livestock and companion animals are rapidly increasing. Some advances have been made in the control and prevention of animal parasitic diseases, but there are still some significant challenges, particularly in relation to foodborne parasitic zoonoses and vector-borne diseases. In addition, new molecular (e.g., genomic and transcriptomic) technologies have been developed and are gradually being introduced into the veterinary parasitology field. Therefore, teaching of veterinary parasitology in Chinese universities has undergone significant changes over the years, in terms of topics, depth and breadth, and also in the ways in which courses are delivered. In this article, we describe the current status of veterinary parasitology teaching at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels in Chinese universities, summarise changes and improvement in veterinary parasitology teaching, and discuss the challenges and opportunities for veterinary parasitology teaching in the 21st century, including the use of new teaching technologies and the integration of the ""One Health"" concept into veterinary parasitology courses."
2,Operational modelling to guide implementation and scale-up of diagnostic tests within the health system: exploring opportunities for parasitic disease diagnostics based on example application for tuberculosis.,"Research and innovation in the diagnosis of infectious and parasitic diseases has led to the development of several promising diagnostic tools, for example in malaria there is extensive literature concerning the use of rapid diagnostic tests. This means policymakers in many low and middle income countries need to make difficult decisions about which of the recommended tools and approaches to implement and scale-up. The test characteristics (e.g. sensitivity and specificity) of the tools alone are not a sufficient basis on which to make these decisions as policymakers need to also consider the best combination of tools, whether the new tools should complement or replace existing diagnostics and who should be tested. Diagnostic strategies need dovetailing to different epidemiology and structural resource constraints (e.g. existing diagnostic pathways, human resources and laboratory capacity). We propose operational modelling to assist with these complex decisions. Projections of patient, health system and cost impacts are essential and operational modelling of the relevant elements of the health system could provide these projections and support rational decisions. We demonstrate how the technique of operational modelling applied in the developing world to support decisions on diagnostics for tuberculosis, could in a parallel way, provide useful insights to support implementation of appropriate diagnostic innovations for parasitic diseases."
2,"Structure of parasites community in Chaetobranchopsis orbicularis (Cichlidae), a host from the Amazon River system in northern Brazil.","The aim of this paper was to investigate the component communities of parasites in Chaetobranchopsis orbicularis from a tributary of the Amazon River system, in Northern Brazil. In 32 fish examined, 902,551 parasites were collected, including Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Piscinoodinium pillulare, Sciadicleithrum geophagi, Posthodiplostomum sp., Clinostomum marginatum, Echinorhynchus paranensis, Neoechinorhynchus pterodoridis, and Dolops longicauda. I. multifiliis was the dominant and abundant parasite species. The ectoparasites presented aggregate dispersion, but the endoparasites showed random dispersion pattern. Mean species richness was 4.0??????1.5 parasites, mean Brillouin diversity (HB) was 0.33??????0.28, mean evenness was 0.15??????0.13, and Berger-Parker dominance (d) was 0.85??????0.17. The species richness of parasites and HB were positively correlated with the length of hosts. There was positive correlation between the abundance of P. pillulare and length and weight, between the abundance of I. multifiliis and weight, as well as between the abundance of E. paranensis and N. pterodoridis and the length of hosts. Body condition of the hosts was not affected by moderate parasitism. The low diversity of endoparasites indicates that C. orbicularis is a host with low position in the food web. This is the first record of all these parasites for C. orbicularis."

1,The Heterologous Expression of the p22 RNA Silencing Suppressor of the Crinivirus Tomato Chlorosis Virus from Tobacco Rattle Virus and Potato Virus X Enhances Disease Severity but Does Not Complement Suppressor-Defective Mutant Viruses.,"To counteract host antiviral RNA silencing, plant viruses express suppressor proteins that function as pathogenicity enhancers. The genome of the Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) (genus <i>Crinivirus</i>, family <i>Closteroviridae</i>) encodes an RNA silencing suppressor, the protein p22, that has been described as having one of the longest lasting local suppressor activities when assayed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Since suppression of RNA silencing and the ability to enhance disease severity are closely associated, we analyzed the effect of expressing p22 in heterologous viral contexts. Thus, we studied the effect of the expression of ToCV p22 from viral vectors Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) and Potato virus X (PVX), and from attenuated suppressor mutants in <i>N. benthamiana</i> plants. Our results show that although an exacerbation of disease symptoms leading to plant death was observed in the heterologous expression of ToCV p22 from both viruses, only in the case of TRV did increased viral accumulation occur. The heterologous expression of ToCV p22 could not complement suppressor-defective mutant viruses."
1,Targeting CTCF to Control Virus Gene Expression: A Common Theme amongst Diverse DNA Viruses.,"All viruses target host cell factors for successful life cycle completion. Transcriptional control of DNA viruses by host cell factors is important in the temporal and spatial regulation of virus gene expression. Many of these factors are recruited to enhance virus gene expression and thereby increase virus production, but host cell factors can also restrict virus gene expression and productivity of infection. CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) is a host cell DNA binding protein important for the regulation of genomic chromatin boundaries, transcriptional control and enhancer element usage. CTCF also functions in RNA polymerase II regulation and in doing so can influence co-transcriptional splicing events. Several DNA viruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) utilize CTCF to control virus gene expression and many studies have highlighted a role for CTCF in the persistence of these diverse oncogenic viruses. CTCF can both enhance and repress virus gene expression and in some cases CTCF increases the complexity of alternatively spliced transcripts. This review article will discuss the function of CTCF in the life cycle of DNA viruses in the context of known host cell CTCF functions. "
1,Impact of Mutations in the Hemagglutinin of H10N7 Viruses Isolated from Seals on Virus Replication in Avian and Human Cells.,"Wild birds are the reservoir for low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses, which are frequently transmitted to domestic birds and occasionally to mammals. In 2014, an H10N7 virus caused severe mortality in harbor seals in northeastern Europe. Although the hemagglutinin (HA) of this virus was closely related to H10 of avian H10N4 virus, it possessed unique nonsynonymous mutations, particularly in the HA1 subunit in or adjacent to the receptor binding domain and proteolytic cleavage site. Here, the impact of these mutations on virus replication was studied in vitro. Using reverse genetics, an avian H10N4 virus was cloned, and nine recombinant viruses carrying one of eight unique mutations or the complete HA from the seal virus were rescued. Receptor binding affinity, replication in avian and mammalian cell cultures, cell-to-cell spread, and HA cleavability of these recombinant viruses were studied. Results show that wild-type recombinant H10N4 virus has high affinity to avian-type sialic acid receptors and no affinity to mammalian-type receptors. The H10N7 virus exhibits dual receptor binding affinity. Interestingly, Q220L (H10 numbering) in the rim of the receptor binding pocket increased the affinity of the H10N4 virus to mammal-type receptors and completely abolished the affinity to avian-type receptors. No remarkable differences in cell-to-cell spread or HA cleavability were observed. All viruses, including the wild-type H10N7 virus, replicated at higher levels in chicken cells than in human cells. These results indicate that H10N7 acquired adaptive mutations (e.g., Q220L) to enhance replication in mammals and retained replication efficiency in the original avian host."
1,Dinucleotide Composition in Animal RNA Viruses Is Shaped More by Virus Family than by Host Species.,"Viruses use the cellular machinery of their hosts for replication. It has therefore been proposed that the nucleotide and dinucleotide compositions of viruses should match those of their host species. If this is upheld, it may then be possible to use dinucleotide composition to predict the true host species of viruses sampled in metagenomic surveys. However, it is also clear that different taxonomic groups of viruses tend to have distinctive patterns of dinucleotide composition that may be independent of host species. To determine the relative strength of the effect of host versus virus family in shaping dinucleotide composition, we performed a comparative analysis of 20 RNA virus families from 15 host groupings, spanning two animal phyla and more than 900 virus species. In particular, we determined the odds ratios for the 16 possible dinucleotides and performed a discriminant analysis to evaluate the capability of virus dinucleotide composition to predict the correct virus family or host taxon from which it was isolated. Notably, while 81% of the data analyzed here were predicted to the correct virus family, only 62% of these data were predicted to their correct subphylum/class host and a mere 32% to their correct mammalian order. Similarly, dinucleotide composition has a weak predictive power for different hosts within individual virus families. We therefore conclude that dinucleotide composition is generally uniform within a virus family but less well reflects that of its host species. This has obvious implications for attempts to accurately predict host species from virus genome sequences alone.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Determining the processes that shape virus genomes is central to understanding virus evolution and emergence. One question of particular importance is why nucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies differ so markedly between viruses. In particular, it is currently unclear whether host species or virus family has the biggest impact on dinucleotide frequencies and whether dinucleotide composition can be used to accurately predict host species. Using a comparative analysis, we show that dinucleotide composition has a strong phylogenetic association across different RNA virus families, such that dinucleotide composition can predict the family from which a virus sequence has been isolated. Conversely, dinucleotide composition has a poorer predictive power for the different host species within a virus family and across different virus families, indicating that the host has a relatively small impact on the dinucleotide composition of a virus genome."
1,Concepts in Light Microscopy of Viruses.,"Viruses threaten humans, livestock, and plants, and are difficult to combat. Imaging of viruses by light microscopy is key to uncover the nature of known and emerging viruses in the quest for finding new ways to treat viral disease and deepening the understanding of virus&ndash;host interactions. Here, we provide an overview of recent technology for imaging cells and viruses by light microscopy, in particular fluorescence microscopy in static and live-cell modes. The review lays out guidelines for how novel fluorescent chemical probes and proteins can be used in light microscopy to illuminate cells, and how they can be used to study virus infections. We discuss advantages and opportunities of confocal and multi-photon microscopy, selective plane illumination microscopy, and super-resolution microscopy. We emphasize the prevalent concepts in image processing and data analyses, and provide an outlook into label-free digital holographic microscopy for virus research."
1,"Elimination of representative contaminant candidate list viruses, coxsackievirus, echovirus, hepatitis A virus, and norovirus, from water by coagulation processes.","We examined the removal of representative contaminant candidate list (CCL) viruses (coxsackievirus [CV] B5, echovirus type [EV] 11, and hepatitis A virus [HAV] IB), recombinant norovirus virus-like particles (rNV-VLPs), and murine norovirus (MNV) type 1 by coagulation. Water samples were subjected to coagulation with polyaluminum chloride (PACl, basicity 1.5) followed by either settling or settling and filtration. Together with our previously published results, the removal ratio order, as evaluated by a plaque-forming-unit method or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after settling, was HAV>EV=rNV-VLPs???CV=poliovirus type 1=MNV>adenovirus type 40 (range, 0.1-2.7-log<sub>10</sub>). Infectious HAV was likely inactivated by the PACl and therefore was removed to a greater extent than the other viruses. A nonsulfated high-basicity PACl (basicity 2.1), removed the CCL viruses more efficiently than did two other sulfated PACls (basicity 1.5 or 2.1), alum, or ferric chloride. We also examined the removal ratio of two bacteriophages. The removal ratios for MS2 tended to be larger than those of the CCL viruses, whereas those for ??X174 were comparable with or smaller than those of the CCL viruses. Therefore, ??X174 may be a useful conservative surrogate for CCL viruses during coagulation."
1,Metagenomic characterization of the virome associated with bovine respiratory disease in feedlot cattle identified novel viruses and suggests an etiologic role for influenza D virus.,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most costly disease affecting the cattle industry. The pathogenesis of BRD is complex and includes contributions from microbial pathogens as well as host, environmental and animal management factors. In this study, we utilized viral metagenomic sequencing to explore the virome of nasal swab samples obtained from feedlot cattle with acute BRD and asymptomatic pen-mates at six and four feedlots in Mexico and the USA, respectively, in April-October 2015. Twenty-one viruses were detected, with bovine rhinitis A (52.7?€?%) and B (23.7?€?%) virus, and bovine coronavirus (24.7?€?%) being the most commonly identified. The emerging influenza D virus (IDV) tended to be significantly associated (P=0.134; odds ratio=2.94) with disease, whereas viruses commonly associated with BRD such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza 3 virus were detected less frequently. The detection of IDV was further confirmed using a real-time PCR assay. Nasal swabs from symptomatic animals had significantly more IDV RNA than those collected from healthy animals (P=0.04). In addition to known viruses, new genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus and enterovirus E were identified and a newly proposed species of bocaparvovirus, Ungulate bocaparvovirus 6, was characterized. Ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 was also detected for the first time in North America to our knowledge. These results illustrate the complexity of the virome associated with BRD and highlight the need for further research into the contribution of other viruses to BRD pathogenesis."
1,Avian Influenza Virus PB1 Gene in H3N2 Viruses Evolved in Humans To Reduce Interferon Inhibition by Skewing Codon Usage toward Interferon-Altered tRNA Pools.,"Influenza A viruses cause an annual contagious respiratory disease in humans and are responsible for periodic high-mortality human pandemics. Pandemic influenza A viruses usually result from the reassortment of gene segments between human and avian influenza viruses. These avian influenza virus gene segments need to adapt to humans. Here we focus on the human adaptation of the synonymous codons of the avian influenza virus PB1 gene of the 1968 H3N2 pandemic virus. We generated recombinant H3N2 viruses differing only in codon usage of PB1 mRNA and demonstrated that codon usage of the PB1 mRNA of recent H3N2 virus isolates enhances replication in interferon (IFN)-treated human cells without affecting replication in untreated cells, thereby partially alleviating the interferon-induced antiviral state. High-throughput sequencing of tRNA pools explains the reduced inhibition of replication by interferon: the levels of some tRNAs differ between interferon-treated and untreated human cells, and evolution of the codon usage of H3N2 PB1 mRNA is skewed toward interferon-altered human tRNA pools. Consequently, the avian influenza virus-derived PB1 mRNAs of modern H3N2 viruses have acquired codon usages that better reflect tRNA availabilities in IFN-treated cells. Our results indicate that the change in tRNA availabilities resulting from interferon treatment is a previously unknown aspect of the antiviral action of interferon, which has been partially overcome by human-adapted H3N2 viruses.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Pandemic influenza A viruses that cause high human mortality usually result from reassortment of gene segments between human and avian influenza viruses. These avian influenza virus gene segments need to adapt to humans. Here we focus on the human adaptation of the avian influenza virus PB1 gene that was incorporated into the 1968 H3N2 pandemic virus. We demonstrate that the coding sequence of the PB1 mRNA of modern H3N2 viruses enhances replication in human cells in which interferon has activated a potent antiviral state. Reduced interferon inhibition results from evolution of PB1 mRNA codons skewed toward the pools of tRNAs in interferon-treated human cells, which, as shown here, differ significantly from the tRNA pools in untreated human cells. Consequently, avian influenza virus-derived PB1 mRNAs of modern H3N2 viruses have acquired codon usages that better reflect tRNA availabilities in IFN-treated cells and are translated more efficiently."
1,"Multiple Reassorted Viruses as Cause of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N8) Virus Epidemic, the Netherlands, 2016.","In 2016, an epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H5N8 in the Netherlands caused mass deaths among wild birds, and several commercial poultry farms and captive bird holdings were affected. We performed complete genome sequencing to study the relationship between the wild bird and poultry viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses are related to H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses detected in Russia in May 2016 but contained novel polymerase basic 2 and nucleoprotein gene segments and 2 different variants of the polymerase acidic segment. Molecular dating suggests that the reassortment events most likely occurred in wild birds in Russia or Mongolia. Furthermore, 2 genetically distinct H5N5 reassortant viruses were detected in wild birds in the Netherlands. Our study provides evidence for fast and continuing reassortment of H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses, which might lead to rapid changes in virus characteristics, such as pathogenicity, infectivity, transmission, and zoonotic potential."
1,Specific Mutations in the PB2 Protein of Influenza A Virus Compensate for the Lack of Efficient Interferon Antagonism of the NS1 Protein of Bat Influenza A-Like Viruses.,"Recently, two new influenza A-like viruses have been discovered in bats, A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/060/2010 (HL17NL10) and A/flat-faced bat/Peru/033/2010 (HL18NL11). The hemagglutinin (HA)-like (HL) and neuraminidase (NA)-like (NL) proteins of these viruses lack hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities, despite their sequence and structural homologies with the HA and NA proteins of conventional influenza A viruses. We have now investigated whether the NS1 proteins of the HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 viruses can functionally replace the NS1 protein of a conventional influenza A virus. For this purpose, we generated recombinant influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) H1N1 viruses containing the NS1 protein of the PR8 wild-type, HL17NL10, and HL18NL11 viruses. These viruses (r/NS1PR8, r/NS1HL17, and r/NS1HL18, respectively) were tested for replication in bat and nonbat mammalian cells and in mice. Our results demonstrate that the r/NS1HL17 and r/NS1HL18 viruses are attenuated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> However, the bat NS1 recombinant viruses showed a phenotype similar to that of the r/NS1PR8 virus in STAT1<sup>-/-</sup> human A549 cells and mice, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> systems being unable to respond to interferon (IFN). Interestingly, multiple mouse passages of the r/NS1HL17 and r/NS1HL18 viruses resulted in selection of mutant viruses containing single amino acid mutations in the viral PB2 protein. In contrast to the parental viruses, virulence and IFN antagonism were restored in the selected PB2 mutants. Our results indicate that the NS1 protein of bat influenza A-like viruses is less efficient than the NS1 protein of its conventional influenza A virus NS1 counterpart in antagonizing the IFN response and that this deficiency can be overcome by the influenza virus PB2 protein.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Significant gaps in our understanding of the basic features of the recently discovered bat influenza A-like viruses HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 remain. The basic biology of these unique viruses displays both similarities to and differences from the basic biology of conventional influenza A viruses. Here, we show that recombinant influenza A viruses containing the NS1 protein from HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 are attenuated. This attenuation was mediated by their inability to antagonize the type I IFN response. However, this deficiency could be compensated for by single amino acid replacements in the PB2 gene. Our results unravel a functional divergence between the NS1 proteins of bat influenza A-like and conventional influenza A viruses and demonstrate an interplay between the viral PB2 and NS1 proteins to antagonize IFN."
1,Analyses of Evolutionary Characteristics of the Hemagglutinin-Esterase Gene of Influenza C Virus during a Period of 68 Years Reveals Evolutionary Patterns Different from Influenza A and B Viruses.,"Infections with the influenza C virus causing respiratory symptoms are common, particularly among children. Since isolation and detection of the virus are rarely performed, compared with influenza A and B viruses, the small number of available sequences of the virus makes it difficult to analyze its evolutionary dynamics. Recently, we reported the full genome sequence of 102 strains of the virus. Here, we exploited the data to elucidate the evolutionary characteristics and phylodynamics of the virus compared with influenza A and B viruses. Along with our data, we obtained public sequence data of the hemagglutinin-esterase gene of the virus; the dataset consists of 218 unique sequences of the virus collected from 14 countries between 1947 and 2014. Informatics analyses revealed that (1) multiple lineages have been circulating globally; (2) there have been weak and infrequent selective bottlenecks; (3) the evolutionary rate is low because of weak positive selection and a low capability to induce mutations; and (4) there is no significant positive selection although a few mutations affecting its antigenicity have been induced. The unique evolutionary dynamics of the influenza C virus must be shaped by multiple factors, including virological, immunological, and epidemiological characteristics."
1,"Viruses in the environment - presence and diversity of bacteriophage and enteric virus populations in the Umhlangane River, Durban, South Africa.","Due to the continued persistence of waterborne viral-associated infections, the presence of enteric viruses is a concern. Notwithstanding the health implications, viral diversity and abundance is an indicator of water quality declination in the environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of viruses (bacteriophage and enteric viruses) in a highly polluted, anthropogenic-influenced river system over a 6-month period at five sampling points. Cytopathic-based tissue culture assays revealed that the isolated viruses were infectious when tested on Hep-G2, HEK293 and Vero cells. While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the majority of the viruses were bacteriophages, a number of presumptive enteric virus families were visualized, some of which include Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Polyomaviridae and Reoviridae. Finally, primer specific nested polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR)/reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) coupled with BLAST analysis identified human adenovirus, polyomavirus and hepatitis A and C virus genomes in river water samples. Taken together, the complexity of both bacteriophage and enteric virus populations in the river has potential health implications. Finally, a systematic integrated risk assessment and management plan to identify and minimize sources of faecal contamination is the most effective way of ensuring water safety and should be established in all future guidelines."
1,Establishment of the cross-clade antigen detection system for H5 subtype influenza viruses using peptide monoclonal antibodies specific for influenza virus H5 hemagglutinin.,"The H5 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5 HPAI) viruses is a threat to both animal and human public health and has the potential to cause a serious future pandemic in humans. Thus, specific and rapid detection of H5 HPAI viruses is required for infection control in humans. To develop a simple and rapid diagnostic system to detect H5 HPAI viruses with high specificity and sensitivity, we attempted to prepare monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically recognize linear epitopes in hemagglutinin (HA) of H5 subtype viruses. Nine mAb clones were obtained from mice immunized with a synthetic partial peptide of H5 HA molecules conserved among various H5 HPAI viruses. The antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the most suitable combination of these mAbs, which bound specifically to lysed H5 HA under an optimized detergent condition, was specific for H5 viruses and could broadly detect H5 viruses in multiple different clades. Taken together, these peptide mAbs, which recognize linear epitopes in a highly conserved region of H5 HA, may be useful for specific and highly sensitive detection of H5 HPAI viruses and can help in the rapid diagnosis of human, avian, and animal H5 virus infections."
1,"Evaluation of the suitability of a plant virus, pepper mild mottle virus, as a surrogate of human enteric viruses for assessment of the efficacy of coagulation-rapid sand filtration to remove those viruses.","Here, we evaluated the removal of three representative human enteric viruses - adenovirus (AdV) type 40, coxsackievirus (CV) B5, and hepatitis A virus (HAV) IB - and one surrogate of human caliciviruses - murine norovirus (MNV) type 1 - by coagulation-rapid sand filtration, using water samples from eight water sources for drinking water treatment plants in Japan. The removal ratios of a plant virus (pepper mild mottle virus; PMMoV) and two bacteriophages (MS2 and ??X174) were compared with the removal ratios of human enteric viruses to assess the suitability of PMMoV, MS2, and ??X174 as surrogates for human enteric viruses. The removal ratios of AdV, CV, HAV, and MNV, evaluated via the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, were 0.8-2.5-log<sub>10</sub> when commercially available polyaluminum chloride (PACl, basicity 1.5) and virgin silica sand were used as the coagulant and filter medium, respectively. The type of coagulant affected the virus removal efficiency, but the age of silica sand used in the rapid sand filtration did not. Coagulation-rapid sand filtration with non-sulfated, high-basicity PACls (basicity 2.1 or 2.5) removed viruses more efficiently than the other aluminum-based coagulants. The removal ratios of MS2 were sometimes higher than those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV, whereas the removal ratios of ??X174 tended to be smaller than those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV. In contrast, the removal ratios of PMMoV were similar to and strongly correlated with those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV. Thus, PMMoV appears to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric viruses for the assessment of the efficacy of coagulation-rapid sand filtration to remove viruses."
1,"High Risk Blueberry Viruses by Region in North America; Implications for Certification, Nurseries, and Fruit Production.","There is limited information on the distribution of blueberry viruses in the U.S. or around the world other than where the viruses were first discovered and characterized. A survey for blueberry viruses was carried out in the U.S. in 2015???2017. Most blueberry viruses have been characterized to the point that sensitive diagnostic assays have been developed. These assays are based on ELISA or variations of PCR, which were employed here to determine the presence of blueberry viruses in major blueberry production and nursery areas of the U.S. The viruses included in this study were: blueberry fruit drop (BFDaV), blueberry latent (BlLV), blueberry leaf mottle (BLMoV), blueberry mosaic (BlMaV), blueberry red ringspot (BRRV), blueberry scorch (BlScV), blueberry shock (BlShV), blueberry shoestring (BlSSV), blueberry virus A (BVA), peach rosette mosaic (PRMV), tobacco ringspot (TRSV), and tomato ringspot (ToRSV). In the Pacific Northwest BlShV was the most widespread virus, with BlScV and ToRSV detected in a limited number of fields in Oregon and Washington, but BlScV was widespread in British Columbia. In the upper midwest, the nematode-borne (ToRSV, TRSV), aphid-transmitted (BlSSV and BVA) and pollen-borne (BLMoV) viruses were most widespread. In the northeast, TRSV, ToRSV, and BlScV, were detected most frequently. In the southeast, BRRV and BNRBV were the most widespread viruses. BlLV, a cryptic virus with no known symptoms or effect on plant growth or yield was present in all regions. There are other viruses present at low levels in each of the areas, but with the lower incidence they pose minimal threat to nursery systems or fruit production. These results indicate that there are hotspots for individual virus groups that normally coincide with the presence of the vectors. The information presented highlights the high risk viruses for nursery and fruit production each pose a different challenge for control."
1,Infectious bursal disease virus in Algeria: Detection of highly pathogenic reassortant viruses.,"Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is an immunosuppressive viral disease, present worldwide, which causes mortality and immunosuppression in young chickens. The causative agent, the Avibirnavirus IBDV, is a non-enveloped virus whose genome consists of two segments (A and B) of double-stranded RNA. Different pathotypes of IBDV exist, ranging from attenuated vaccine strains to very virulent viruses (vvIBDV). In Algeria, despite the prophylactic measures implemented, cases of IBD are still often diagnosed clinically and the current molecular epidemiology of IBDV remains unknown. The presence of the virus and especially of strains genetically close to vvIBDV was confirmed in 2000 by an unpublished OIE report. In this study, nineteen IBDV isolates were collected in Algeria between September 2014 and September 2015 during clinical outbreaks. These isolates were analyzed at the genetic, antigenic and pathogenic levels. Our results reveal a broad genetic and phenotypic diversity of pathogenic IBDV strains in Algeria, with, i) the circulation of viruses with both genome segments related to European vvIBDV, which proved as pathogenic for specific pathogen-free chickens as vvIBDV reference strain, ii) the circulation of viruses closely related - yet with a specific segment B - to European vvIBDV, their pathogenicity being lower than reference vvIBDV, iii) the detection of reassortant viruses whose segment A was related to vvIBDV whereas their segment B did not appear closely related to any reference sequence. Interestingly, the pathogenicity of these potentially reassortant strains was comparable to that of reference vvIBDV. All strains characterized in this study exhibited an antigenicity similar to the cognate reference IBDV strains. These data reveal the continuous genetic evolution of IBDV strains in Algerian poultry through reassortment and acquisition of genetic material of unidentified origin. Continuous surveillance of the situation as well as good vaccination practice associated with appropriate biosecurity measures are necessary for disease control."
1,Seasonal Dynamics of Haptophytes and dsDNA Algal Viruses Suggest Complex Virus-Host Relationship.,"Viruses influence the ecology and diversity of phytoplankton in the ocean. Most studies of phytoplankton host-virus interactions have focused on bloom-forming species like <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> or <i>Phaeocystis</i> spp. The role of viruses infecting phytoplankton that do not form conspicuous blooms have received less attention. Here we explore the dynamics of phytoplankton and algal viruses over several sequential seasons, with a focus on the ubiquitous and diverse phytoplankton division Haptophyta, and their double-stranded DNA viruses, potentially with the capacity to infect the haptophytes. Viral and phytoplankton abundance and diversity showed recurrent seasonal changes, mainly explained by hydrographic conditions. By 454 tag-sequencing we revealed 93 unique haptophyte operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with seasonal changes in abundance. Sixty-one unique viral OTUs, representing Megaviridae and <i>Phycodnaviridae</i>, showed only distant relationship with currently isolated algal viruses. Haptophyte and virus community composition and diversity varied substantially throughout the year, but in an uncoordinated manner. A minority of the viral OTUs were highly abundant at specific time-points, indicating a boom-bust relationship with their host. Most of the viral OTUs were very persistent, which may represent viruses that coexist with their hosts, or able to exploit several host species."
1,"Protective hybrid coating containing silver, copper and zinc cations effective against human immunodeficiency virus and other enveloped viruses.","Healthcare-acquired infections by pathogenic microorganisms including viruses represent significant health concern worldwide. Next to direct transmission from person-to-person also indirect transmission from contaminated surfaces is well documented and important route of infections. Here, we tested antiviral properties of hybrid coating containing silver, copper and zinc cations that was previously shown to be effective against pathogenic bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Hybrid coatings containing silver, copper and zinc cations were prepared through radical polymerization via sol-gel method and applied on glass slides or into the wells of polymethylmethacrylate plates. A 10 ??l droplet of several viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), influenza, dengue virus, herpes simplex virus, and coxsackievirus was added to coated and uncoated slides or plates, incubated usually from 5 to 240 min and followed by titer determination of recovered virus.Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed better adhesion of coatings on glass surfaces, which resulted in 99.5-100 % HIV-1 titer reduction (3.1?€????€?0.8 log10TCID50, n?€?=?€?3) already after 20 min of exposure to coatings, than on coated polymethylmethacrylate plates with 75-100 % (1.7?€????€?1.1 log10TCID50, n?€?=?€?3) and 98-100 % (2.3?€????€?0.5 log10TCID50, n?€?=?€?3) HIV-1 titer reduction after 20 and 120 min of exposure, respectively. Slower virucidal kinetics was observed with other enveloped viruses, where 240 min exposure to coated slides lead to 97 % (dengue), 100 % (herpes simplex) and 77 % (influenza) reduction in virus titers. Interestingly, only marginal reduction in viral titer after 240 min of exposure was noticed for non-enveloped coxsackie B3 virus.Our hybrid coatings showed virucidal activity against HIV and other enveloped viruses thus providing further findings towards development of broad-spectrum antimicrobial coating suitable for surfaces in healthcare settings."
1,"Isolation and Genome Phylogenetic Analysis of Arthropod-Borne Viruses, Including Akabane Virus, from Mosquitoes Collected in Hunan Province, China.","This study investigated the abundance of mosquitoes and circulation of mosquito-borne arboviruses from 16 villages in 8 cities of Hunan Province, China, in July-August of 2010 and in August of 2011. In total, 16,076 mosquitoes consisting of seven species from four genera were collected by ultraviolet-light trap. Culex quinquefasciatus was the most common species, accounting for 50.63% (8140/16,076) of the total. Anopheles sinensis (24.26%, 3900/16,076) made up the second most common species, followed by Culex tritaeniorhynchus (9.76%, 1569/16,076). The proportions of Culex pipiens pallens, Armigeres subalbatus, and Culex modestus were 6.7%, 5.2%, and 3.31%, respectively. Fourteen Aedes albopictus were detected. The mosquitoes were identified by morphologic characteristics and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The mosquitoes were pooled, triturated, and centrifuged. The clarified supernatant was used to inoculate monolayers of C6/36 and baby hamster kidney-21 cells. We obtained six virus isolates that caused cytopathic effects. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two isolates were Akabane virus (AKAV, from A. sinensis and C. quinquefasciatus), two isolates were Japanese encephalitis virus (from C. pipiens pallens and C. quinquefasciatus), and two isolates were Tibet orbivirus (from C. quinquefasciatus and C. tritaeniorhynchus). This is the first report of AKAV isolated from A. sinensis and C. quinquefasciatus in nature in China. The detection of AKAV in these species confirms circulation of AKAV in Hunan province and suggests potential challenges to the prevention and control of arthropod-borne animal viruses in mainland China."
1,Attenuation of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses in Indonesia following the reassortment and acquisition of genes from low pathogenicity avian influenza A virus progenitors.,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus is endemic in Indonesian poultry and has caused sporadic human infection in Indonesia since 2005. Surveillance of H5N1 viruses in live bird markets (LBMs) during 2012 and 2013 was carried out to provide epidemiologic and virologic information regarding viral circulation and the risk of human exposure. Real-time RT-PCR of avian cloacal swabs and environmental samples revealed influenza A-positive specimens, which were then subjected to virus isolation and genomic sequencing. Genetic analysis of specimens collected at multiple LBMs in Indonesia identified both low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H3N8) and HPAI A(H5N1) viruses belonging to clade 2.1.3.2a. Comparison of internal gene segments among the LPAI and HPAI viruses revealed that the latter had acquired the PB2, PB1, and NS genes from LPAI progenitors and other viruses containing a wild type (wt) genomic constellation. Comparison of murine infectivity of the LPAI A(H3N8), wt HPAI A(H5N1) and reassortant HPAI A(H5N1) viruses showed that the acquisition of LPAI internal genes attenuated the reassortant HPAI virus, producing a mouse infectivity/virulence phenotype comparable to that of the LPAI virus. Comparison of molecular markers in each viral gene segment suggested that mutations in PB2 and NS1 may facilitate attenuation. The discovery of an attenuated HPAI A(H5N1) virus in mice that resulted from reassortment may have implications for the capability of these viruses to transmit and cause disease. In addition, surveillance suggests that LBMs in Indonesia may play a role in the generation of reassortant A(H5) viruses and should be monitored."
1,"Chikungunya, Influenza, Nipah, and Semliki Forest Chimeric Viruses with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus: Actions in the Brain.","Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based chimeric viruses that include genes from other viruses show promise as vaccines and oncolytic viruses. However, the critical safety concern is the neurotropic nature conveyed by the VSV glycoprotein. VSVs that include the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene, even in most recombinant attenuated strains, can still show substantial adverse or lethal actions in the brain. Here, we test 4 chimeric viruses in the brain, including those in which glycoprotein genes from Nipah, chikungunya (CHIKV), and influenza H5N1 viruses were substituted for the VSV glycoprotein gene. We also test a virus-like vesicle (VLV) in which the VSV glycoprotein gene is expressed from a replicon encoding the nonstructural proteins of Semliki Forest virus. VSV??G-CHIKV, VSV??G-H5N1, and VLV were all safe in the adult mouse brain, as were VSV??G viruses expressing either the Nipah F or G glycoprotein. In contrast, a complementing pair of VSV??G viruses expressing Nipah G and F glycoproteins were lethal within the brain within a surprisingly short time frame of 2 days. Intranasal inoculation in postnatal day 14 mice with VSV??G-CHIKV or VLV evoked no adverse response, whereas VSV??G-H5N1 by this route was lethal in most mice. A key immune mechanism underlying the safety of VSV??G-CHIKV, VSV??G-H5N1, and VLV in the adult brain was the type I interferon response; all three viruses were lethal in the brains of adult mice lacking the interferon receptor, suggesting that the viruses can infect and replicate and spread in brain cells if not blocked by interferon-stimulated genes within the brain.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) shows considerable promise both as a vaccine vector and as an oncolytic virus. The greatest limitation of VSV is that it is highly neurotropic and can be lethal within the brain. The neurotropism can be mostly attributed to the VSV G glycoprotein. Here, we test 4 chimeric viruses of VSV with glycoprotein genes from Nipah, chikungunya, and influenza viruses and nonstructural genes from Semliki Forest virus. Two of the four, VSV??G-CHIKV and VLV, show substantially attenuated neurotropism and were safe in the healthy adult mouse brain. VSV??G-H5N1 was safe in the adult brain but lethal in the younger brain. VSV??G Nipah F+G was even more neurotropic than wild-type VSV, evoking a rapid lethal response in the adult brain. These results suggest that while chimeric VSVs show promise, each must be tested with both intranasal and intracranial administration to ensure the absence of lethal neurotropism."
1,Virus like particle-based vaccines against emerging infectious disease viruses.,"Emerging infectious diseases are major threats to human health. Most severe viral disease outbreaks occur in developing regions where health conditions are poor. With increased international travel and business, the possibility of eventually transmitting infectious viruses between different countries is increasing. The most effective approach in preventing viral diseases is vaccination. However, vaccines are not currently available for numerous viral diseases. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are engineered vaccine candidates that have been studied for decades. VLPs are constructed by viral protein expression in various expression systems that promote the selfassembly of proteins into structures resembling virus particles. VLPs have antigenicity similar to that of the native virus, but are non-infectious as they lack key viral genetic material. VLP vaccines have attracted considerable research interest because they offer several advantages over traditional vaccines. Studies have shown that VLP vaccines can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses, which may offer effective antiviral protection. Here we review recent developments with VLP-based vaccines for several highly virulent emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases. The infectious agents discussed include RNA viruses from different virus families, such as the Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Togaviridae families. "
1,Tick-Borne Viruses and Biological Processes at the Tick-Host-Virus Interface.,"Ticks are efficient vectors of arboviruses, although less than 10% of tick species are known to be virus vectors. Most tick-borne viruses (TBV) are RNA viruses some of which cause serious diseases in humans and animals world-wide. Several TBV impacting human or domesticated animal health have been found to emerge or re-emerge recently. In order to survive in nature, TBV must infect and replicate in both vertebrate and tick cells, representing very different physiological environments. Information on molecular mechanisms that allow TBV to switch between infecting and replicating in tick and vertebrate cells is scarce. In general, ticks succeed in completing their blood meal thanks to a plethora of biologically active molecules in their saliva that counteract and modulate different arms of the host defense responses (haemostasis, inflammation, innate and acquired immunity, and wound healing). The transmission of TBV occurs primarily during tick feeding and is a complex process, known to be promoted by tick saliva constituents. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of TBV transmission are poorly understood. Immunomodulatory properties of tick saliva helping overcome the first line of defense to injury and early interactions at the tick-host skin interface appear to be essential in successful TBV transmission and infection of susceptible vertebrate hosts. The local host skin site of tick attachment, modulated by tick saliva, is an important focus of virus replication. Immunomodulation of the tick attachment site also promotes co-feeding transmission of viruses from infected to non-infected ticks in the absence of host viraemia (non-viraemic transmission). Future research should be aimed at identification of the key tick salivary molecules promoting virus transmission, and a molecular description of tick-host-virus interactions and of tick-mediated skin immunomodulation. Such insights will enable the rationale design of anti-tick vaccines that protect against disease caused by tick-borne viruses."
1,Assessment of the efficacy of membrane filtration processes to remove human enteric viruses and the suitability of bacteriophages and a plant virus as surrogates for those viruses.,"Here, we evaluated the efficacy of direct microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) to remove three representative human enteric viruses (i.e., adenovirus [AdV] type 40, coxsackievirus [CV] B5, and hepatitis A virus [HAV] IB), and one surrogate of human caliciviruses (i.e., murine norovirus [MNV] type 1). Eight different MF membranes and three different UF membranes were used. We also examined the ability of coagulation pretreatment with high-basicity polyaluminum chloride (PACl) to enhance virus removal by MF. The removal ratios of two bacteriophages (MS2 and ??X174) and a plant virus (pepper mild mottle virus; PMMoV) were compared with the removal ratios of the human enteric viruses to assess the suitability of these viruses to be used as surrogates for human enteric viruses. The virus removal ratios obtained with direct MF with membranes with nominal pore sizes of 0.1-0.22????m differed, depending on the membrane used; adsorptive interactions, particularly hydrophobic interactions between virus particles and the membrane surface, were dominant factors for virus removal. In contrast, direct UF with membranes with nominal molecular weight cutoffs of 1-100??kDa effectively removed viruses through size exclusion, and >4-log<sub>10</sub> removal was achieved when a membrane with a nominal molecular weight cutoff of 1??kDa was used. At pH 7 and 8, in-line coagulation-MF with nonsulfated high-basicity PACls containing Al<sub>30</sub> species had generally a better virus removal (i.e., >4-log<sub>10</sub> virus removal) than the other aluminum-based coagulants, except for ??X174. For all of the filtration processes, the removal ratios of AdV, CV, HAV, and MNV were comparable and strongly correlated with each other. The removal ratios of MS2 and PMMoV were comparable or smaller than those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV, and were strongly correlated with those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV. The removal ratios obtained with coagulation-MF for ??X174 were markedly smaller than those obtained for the three human enteric viruses and MNV. However, because MS2 was inactivated after contact with PACl during coagulation pretreatment, unlike AdV, CV, MNV, and PMMoV, the removal ratios of infectious MS2 were probably an overestimation of the ability of coagulation-MF to remove infectious AdV, CV, and caliciviruses. Thus, PMMoV appears to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric viruses, whereas MS2 and ??X174 do not, for the assessment of the efficacy of membrane filtration processes to remove viruses."
1,HCIV-1 and Other Tailless Icosahedral Internal Membrane-Containing Viruses of the Family Sphaerolipoviridae.,"Members of the virus family <i>Sphaerolipoviridae</i> include both archaeal viruses and bacteriophages that possess a tailless icosahedral capsid with an internal membrane. The genera <i>Alpha-</i> and <i>Betasphaerolipovirus</i> comprise viruses that infect halophilic euryarchaea, whereas viruses of thermophilic <i>Thermus</i> bacteria belong to the genus <i>Gammasphaerolipovirus</i>. Both sequence-based and structural clustering of the major capsid proteins and ATPases of sphaerolipoviruses yield three distinct clades corresponding to these three genera. Conserved virion architectural principles observed in sphaerolipoviruses suggest that these viruses belong to the PRD1-adenovirus structural lineage. Here we focus on archaeal alphasphaerolipoviruses and their related putative proviruses. The highest sequence similarities among alphasphaerolipoviruses are observed in the core structural elements of their virions: the two major capsid proteins, the major membrane protein, and a putative packaging ATPase. A recently described tailless icosahedral haloarchaeal virus, <i>Haloarcula californiae</i> icosahedral virus 1 (HCIV-1), has a double-stranded DNA genome and an internal membrane lining the capsid. HCIV-1 shares significant similarities with the other tailless icosahedral internal membrane-containing haloarchaeal viruses of the family <i>Sphaerolipoviridae</i>. The proposal to include a new virus species, <i>Haloarcula virus HCIV1</i>, into the genus <i>Alphasphaerolipovirus</i> was submitted to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 2016."
1,Interactions between Enteric Bacteria and Eukaryotic Viruses Impact the Outcome of Infection.,"Enteric viruses encounter a multitude of environments as they traverse the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction of enteric eukaryotic viruses with members of the host microbiota impacts the outcome of infection. Infection with several enteric viruses is impaired in the absence of the gut microbiota, specifically bacteria. The effects of bacteria on virus biology are diverse. Poliovirus capsid stability and receptor engagement are positively impacted by bacteria and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Norovirus utilizes histo-blood group antigens produced by enteric bacteria to attach and productively infect B cells. Lipopolysaccharides on the envelope of mouse mammary tumor virus promote a tolerogenic environment that allows for the establishment of viral persistence. Reovirus binds Gram negative and Gram-positive bacteria through bacterial envelope components to enhance virion thermostability. Through the direct engagement of bacteria and bacterial components, viruses evolved diverse ways to impact the outcome of infection."
1,Viral Metagenomic-Based Screening of Sugarcane from Florida Reveals Occurrence of Six Sugarcane-Infecting Viruses and High Prevalence of Sugarcane yellow leaf virus.,"A viral metagenomics study of the sugarcane virome in Florida was carried out in 2013 to 2014 to analyze occurrence of known and potentially new viruses. In total, 214 sugarcane leaf samples were collected from different commercial sugarcane (Saccharum interspecific hybrids) fields in Florida and from other Saccharum and related species taken from two local germplasm collections. Virion-associated nucleic acids (VANA) metagenomics was used for detection and identification of viruses present within the collected leaf samples. VANA sequence reads were obtained for 204 leaf samples and all four previously reported sugarcane viruses occurring in Florida were detected: Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (SCYLV, 150 infected samples out of 204), Sugarcane mosaic virus (1 of 204), Sugarcane mild mosaic virus (13 of 204), and Sugarcane bacilliform virus (54 of 204). High prevalence of SCYLV in Florida commercial fields and germplasm collections was confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analyses revealed the presence of SCYLV isolates belonging to two different phylogenetic clades (I and II), including a new genotype of this virus. This viral metagenomics approach also resulted in the detection of a new sugarcane-infecting mastrevirus (recently described and named Sugarcane striate virus), and two potential new viruses in the genera Chrysovirus and Umbravirus."
1,Co-infection with Influenza Viruses and Influenza-Like Virus During the 2015/2016 Epidemic Season.,"Concerning viral infection of the respiratory system, a single virus can cause a variety of clinical symptoms and the same set of symptoms can be caused by different viruses. Moreover, infection is often caused by a combination of viruses acting at the same time. The present study demonstrates, using multiplex RT-PCR and real-time qRT-PCR, that in the 2015/2016 influenza season, co-infections were confirmed in patients aged 1 month to 90 years. We found 73 co-infections involving influenza viruses, 17 involving influenza viruses and influenza-like viruses, and six involving influenza-like viruses. The first type of co-infections above mentioned was the most common, amounting to 51 cases, with type A and B viruses occurring simultaneously. There also were four cases of co-infections with influenza virus A/H1N1/pdm09 and A/H1N1/ subtypes and two cases with A/H1N1/pdm09 and A/H3N2/ subtypes. The 2015/2016 epidemic season was characterized by a higher number of confirmed co-infections compared with the previous seasons. Infections by more than one respiratory virus were most often found in children and in individuals aged over 65."
1,Development of Clade-Specific and Broadly Reactive Live Attenuated Influenza Virus Vaccines against Rapidly Evolving H5 Subtype Viruses.,"We have developed pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccines (pLAIVs) against clade 1 H5N1 viruses on an Ann Arbor cold-adapted (<i>ca</i>) backbone that induced long-term immune memory. In 2015, many human infections caused by a new clade (clade 2.2.1.1) of goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage H5N1 viruses were reported in Egypt, which prompted updating of the H5N1 pLAIV. We explored two strategies to generate suitable pLAIVs. The first approach was to modify the hemagglutinin gene of a highly pathogenic wild-type (<i>wt</i>) clade 2.2.1.1 virus, A/Egypt/N03434/2009 (Egy/09) (H5N1), with its unmodified neuraminidase (NA) gene; this virus was designated Egy/09 <i>ca</i> The second approach was to select a low-pathogenicity avian influenza H5 virus that elicited antibodies that cross-reacted with a broad range of H5 viruses, including the Egypt H5N1 viruses, and contained a novel NA subtype for humans. We selected the low-pathogenicity A/duck/Hokkaido/69/2000 (H5N3) (dk/Hok/00) virus for this purpose. Both candidate vaccines were attenuated and immunogenic in ferrets, inducing antibodies that neutralized homologous and heterologous H5 viruses with different degrees of cross-reactivity; Egy/09 <i>ca</i> vaccine antisera were more specific for the gs/GD lineage viruses but did not neutralize recent North American isolates (clade 2.3.4.4), whereas antisera from dk/Hok/69 <i>ca</i>-vaccinated ferrets cross-reacted with clade 2.3.4.4 and 2.2.1 viruses but not clade 1 or 2.1 viruses. When vaccinated ferrets were challenged with homologous and heterologous H5 viruses, challenge virus replication was reduced in the respiratory tract. Thus, the two H5 pLAIV candidates are suitable for clinical development to protect humans from infection with different clades of H5 viruses.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In response to the continuing evolution of H5N1 avian influenza viruses and human infections, new candidate H5 live attenuated vaccines were developed by using two different approaches: one targeted a specific circulating strain in Egypt, and the other was based on a virus that elicits broadly cross-reactive antibodies against a wide range of H5 viruses. Both candidate vaccines were immunogenic and exhibited protective efficacy in ferrets. Our study permits a comparison of the two approaches, and the data support the further development of both vaccine viruses to optimally prepare for the further spread of clade 2.2.1 or 2.3.4.4 viruses."
1,Susceptibility Genes to Plant Viruses.,"Plant viruses use cellular factors and resources to replicate and move. Plants respond to viral infection by several mechanisms, including innate immunity, autophagy, and gene silencing, that viruses must evade or suppress. Thus, the establishment of infection is genetically determined by the availability of host factors necessary for virus replication and movement and by the balance between plant defense and viral suppression of defense responses. Host factors may have antiviral or proviral activities. Proviral factors condition susceptibility to viruses by participating in processes essential to the virus. Here, we review current advances in the identification and characterization of host factors that condition susceptibility to plant viruses. Host factors with proviral activity have been identified for all parts of the virus infection cycle: viral RNA translation, viral replication complex formation, accumulation or activity of virus replication proteins, virus movement, and virion assembly. These factors could be targets of gene editing to engineer resistance to plant viruses."
1,Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies against HA Protein of H1N1 Swine Influenza Virus and Protective Efficacy against H1 Viruses in Mice.,"H1N1 swine influenza viruses (SIV) are prevalent in pigs globally, and occasionally emerge in humans, which raises concern about their pandemic threats. To stimulate hemagglutination (HA) of A/Swine/Guangdong/LM/2004 (H1N1) (SW/GD/04) antibody response, eukaryotic expression plasmid pCI-neo-HA was constructed and used as an immunogen to prepare monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Five mAbs (designed 8C4, 8C6, 9D6, 8A4, and 8B1) against HA protein were obtained and characterized. Western blot showed that the 70 kDa HA protein could be detected by all mAbs in MDCK cells infected with SW/GD/04. Three mAbs-8C4, 8C6, and 9D6-have hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralization test (NT) activities, and 8C6 induces the highest HI and NT titers. The protection efficacy of 8C6 was investigated in BALB/c mice challenged with homologous or heterologous strains of the H1 subtype SIV. The results indicate that mAb 8C6 protected the mice from viral infections, especially the homologous strain, which was clearly demonstrated by the body weight changes and reduction of viral load. Thus, our findings document for the first time that mAb 8C6 might be of potential therapeutic value for H1 subtype SIV infection."
1,Genes for Membrane Transport Proteins: Not So Rare in Viruses.,"Some viruses have genes encoding proteins with membrane transport functions. It is unknown if these types of proteins are rare or are common in viruses. In particular, the evolutionary origin of some of the viral genes is obscure, where other viral proteins have homologs in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. We searched virus genomes in databases looking for transmembrane proteins with possible transport function. This effort led to the detection of 18 different types of putative membrane transport proteins indicating that they are not a rarity in viral genomes. The most abundant proteins are K??? channels. Their predicted structures vary between different viruses. With a few exceptions, the viral proteins differed significantly from homologs in their current hosts. In some cases the data provide evidence for a recent gene transfer between host and virus, but in other cases the evidence indicates a more complex evolutionary history."
1,"Association of interferon lambda-1 with herpes simplex viruses-1 and -2, Epstein-Barr virus, and human cytomegalovirus in chronic periodontitis.","Periodontal tissues facilitate the homing of herpes viruses that elicit the immune-inflammatory response releasing the interferons (IFN). IFN lambda-1 (??1) can suppress the replication of viruses, and induces the antiviral mechanism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between IFN-??1 and periodontal herpes viruses in the immunoregulation of chronic periodontal disease.The cross-sectional study design included 30 chronic periodontitis patients with a mean age of 42.30??????8.63??years. Gingival crevicular fluid collected was assessed for IFN-??1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and four herpes viruses were detected using multiplex polymerase chain reaction technique. IFN-??1 levels were compared between virus-positive and -negative patients for individual and total viruses.Fifty per cent (n??=??15) of patients were positive for the four herpes viruses together; 50% (n??=??15), 30% (n??=??9), 26.7% (n??=??8), and 40% (n??=??12) were positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, Epstein-Barr virus, HSV-2, and human cytomegalovirus, respectively. The mean concentrations of IFN-??1 in virus-positive patients (14.38??????13.95) were lower than those of virus-negative patients (228.26??????215.35). INF-??1 levels in individual virus groups were also lower in virus-positive patients compared to virus-negative patients, with P??<??0.001.These results suggest that IFN-??1 could have antiviral and therapeutic value against the viruses in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis."
1,Immunology of bats and their viruses: challenges and opportunities.,"Bats are reservoir hosts of several high-impact viruses that cause significant human diseases, including Nipah virus, Marburg virus and rabies virus. They also harbor many other viruses that are thought to have caused disease in humans after spillover into intermediate hosts, including SARS and MERS coronaviruses. As is usual with reservoir hosts, these viruses apparently cause little or no pathology in bats. Despite the importance of bats as reservoir hosts of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic agents, virtually nothing is known about the host/virus relationships; principally because few colonies of bats are available for experimental infections, a lack of reagents, methods and expertise for studying bat antiviral responses and immunology, and the difficulty of conducting meaningful field work. These challenges can be addressed, in part, with new technologies that are species-independent that can provide insight into the interactions of bats and viruses, which should clarify how the viruses persist in nature, and what risk factors might facilitate transmission to humans and livestock."
1,"Replication of H9 influenza viruses in the human ex vivo respiratory tract, and the influence of neuraminidase on virus release.","H9N2 viruses are the most widespread influenza viruses in poultry in Asia. We evaluated the infection and tropism of human and avian H9 influenza virus in the human respiratory tract using ex vivo respiratory organ culture. H9 viruses infected the upper and lower respiratory tract and the majority of H9 viruses had a decreased ability to release virus from the bronchus rather than the lung. This may be attributed to a weak neuraminidase (NA) cleavage of carbon-6-linked sialic acid (Sia) rather than carbon-3-linked Sia. The modified cleavage of N-acetlylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) by NA in H9 virus replication was observed by reverse genetics, and recombinant H9N2 viruses with amino acids (38KQ) deleted in the NA stalk, and changing the amino acid at position 431 from Proline-to-Lysine. Using recombinant H9 viruses previously evaluated in the ferret, we found that viruses which replicated well in the ferret did not replicate to the same extent in the human ex vivo cultures. The existing risk assessment models for H9N2 viruses in ferrets may not always have a strong correlation with the replication in the human upper respiratory tract. The inclusion of the human ex vivo cultures would further strengthen the future risk-assessment strategies."
1,"Amalga-like virus infecting Antonospora locustae, a microsporidian pathogen of grasshoppers, plus related viruses associated with other arthropods.","A previously reported Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) library from spores of microsporidian Antonospora locustae includes a number of clones with sequence similarities to plant amalgaviruses. Reexamining the sequence accessions from that library, we found additional such clones, contributing to a 3247-nt contig that approximates the length of an amalga-like virus genome. Using A. locustae spores stored from that previous study, and new ones obtained from the same source, we newly visualized the putative dsRNA genome of this virus and obtained amplicons yielding a 3387-nt complete genome sequence. Phylogenetic analyses suggested it as prototype strain of a new genus in family Amalgaviridae. The genome contains two partially overlapping long ORFs, with downstream ORF2 in the +1 frame relative to ORF1 and a proposed motif for +1 ribosomal frameshifting in the region of overlap. Subsequent database searches using the predicted fusion protein sequence of this new amalga-like virus identified related sequences in the transcriptome of a basal hexapod, the springtail species Tetrodontophora bielanensis. We speculate that this second new amalga-like virus (contig length, 3475 nt) likely also derived from a microsporidian, or related organism, which was associated with the springtail specimens at the time of sampling for transcriptome analysis. Other findings of interest include evidence that the ORF1 translation products of these two new amalga-like viruses contain a central region of predicted ??-helical coiled coil, as recently reported for plant amalgaviruses, and transcriptome-based evidence for another new amalga-like virus in the transcriptome of another basal hexapod, the two-pronged bristletail species Campodea augens."
1,"Comparison of Adjuvanted-Whole Inactivated Virus and Live-Attenuated Virus Vaccines against Challenge with Contemporary, Antigenically Distinct H3N2 Influenza A Viruses.","Influenza A viruses in swine (IAV-S) circulating in the United States of America are phylogenetically and antigenically distinct. A human H3 hemagglutinin (HA) was introduced into the IAV-S gene pool in the late 1990s, sustained continued circulation, and evolved into five monophyletic genetic clades, H3 clades IV-A to -E, after 2009. Across these phylogenetic clades, distinct antigenic clusters were identified, with three clusters (cyan, red, and green antigenic cluster) among the most frequently detected antigenic phenotypes (Abente EJ, Santos J, Lewis NS, Gauger PC, Stratton J, et al. J Virol 90:8266-8280, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01002-16). Although it was demonstrated that antigenic diversity of H3N2 IAV-S was associated with changes at a few amino acid positions in the head of the HA, the implications of this diversity for vaccine efficacy were not tested. Using antigenically representative H3N2 viruses, we compared whole inactivated virus (WIV) and live-attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines for protection against challenge with antigenically distinct H3N2 viruses in pigs. WIV provided partial protection against antigenically distinct viruses but did not prevent virus replication in the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, LAIV provided complete protection from disease and virus was not detected after challenge with antigenically distinct viruses.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Due to the rapid evolution of the influenza A virus, vaccines require continuous strain updates. Additionally, the platform used to deliver the vaccine can have an impact on the breadth of protection. Currently, there are various vaccine platforms available to prevent influenza A virus infection in swine, and we experimentally tested two: adjuvanted-whole inactivated virus and live-attenuated virus. When challenged with an antigenically distinct virus, adjuvanted-whole inactivated virus provided partial protection, while live-attenuated virus provided effective protection. Additional strategies are required to broaden the protective properties of inactivated virus vaccines, given the dynamic antigenic landscape of cocirculating strains in North America, whereas live-attenuated vaccines may require less frequent strain updates, based on demonstrated cross-protection. Enhancing vaccine efficacy to control influenza infections in swine will help reduce the impact they have on swine production and reduce the risk of swine-to-human transmission."
1,Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are the major respiratory viruses detected from prospective testing of pediatric and adult coronial autopsies.,"To ascertain the full mortality of influenza and other respiratory viruses, the testing of community autopsy specimens is essential.Respiratory virus PCR and culture were performed on 2418 fresh unfrozen respiratory samples collected from 1611 coronial cases where the death was either unknown or infection was suspected, from July 2007 to June 2011, to detect the common respiratory viruses in children and adults, using standardized microbiological testing.The respiratory virus positive rate was 8??3% (134 cases) with a peak of 28% (42 of 151 cases) in children under 10??years of age. Influenza virus was the commonest respiratory virus (50 cases, 3%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (30 cases, 2%). All tested respiratory viruses were found in children, most commonly adenovirus, enterovirus and RSV, and influenza A and RSV predominated in those over 60??years, but coinfection was uncommon. Almost all influenza cases occurred when influenza was widely circulating in the community but few were diagnosed pre-mortem. Influenza and RSV detection was associated with bronchitis or bronchiolitis in 7 (9%) of the 80 cases and caused pneumonia in 14 (0??8%) deaths overall.Our prospective review of respiratory viruses using standardized testing found a single lower respiratory tract autopsy specimen for respiratory virus PCR would detect most community infections at the time of death."
1,Challenge for One Health: Co-Circulation of Zoonotic H5N1 and H9N2 Avian Influenza Viruses in Egypt.,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses are currently endemic in poultry in Egypt. Eradication of the viruses has been unsuccessful due to improper application of vaccine-based control strategies among other preventive measures. The viruses have evolved rapidly with increased bird-to-human transmission efficacy, thus affecting both animal and public health. Subsequent spread of potentially zoonotic low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H9N2 in poultry has also hindered efficient control of avian influenza. The H5N1 viruses acquired enhanced bird-to-human transmissibility by (1) altering amino acids in hemagglutinin (HA) that enable binding affinity to human-type receptors, (2) loss of the glycosylation site and 130 loop in the HA protein and (3) mutation of E627K in the PB2 protein to enhance viral replication in mammalian hosts. The receptor binding site of HA of Egyptian H9N2 viruses has been shown to contain the Q234L substitution along with a H191 mutation, which can increase human-like receptor specificity. Therefore, co-circulation of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses in poultry farming and live bird markets has increased the risk of human exposure, resulting in complication of the epidemiological situation and raising a concern for potential emergence of a new influenza A virus pandemic. For efficient control of infection and transmission, the efficacy of vaccine and vaccination needs to be improved with a comprehensive control strategy, including enhanced biosecurity, education, surveillance, rapid diagnosis and culling of infected poultry."
1,Generation of a reassortant avian influenza virus H5N2 vaccine strain capable of protecting chickens against infection with Egyptian H5N1 and H9N2 viruses.,"Avian influenza H5N1 viruses have been enzootic in Egyptian poultry since 2006. Avian influenza H9N2 viruses which have been circulating in Egyptian poultry since 2011 showed high replication rates in embryonated chicken eggs and mammalian cells.To investigate which gene segment was responsible for increasing replication, we constructed reassortant influenza viruses using the low pathogenic H1N1 PR8 virus as backbone and included individual genes from A/chicken/Egypt/S4456B/2011(H9N2) virus. Then, we invested this finding to improve a PR8-derived H5N1 influenza vaccine strain by incorporation of the NA segment of H9N2 virus instead of the NA of H5N1. The growth properties of this virus and several other forms of reassortant H5 viruses were compared. Finally, we tested the efficacy of this reassortant vaccine strain in chickens.We observed an increase in replication for a reassortant virus expressing the neuraminidase gene (N2) of H9N2 virus relative to that of either parental viruses or reassortant PR8 viruses expressing other genes. Then, we generated an H5N2 vaccine strain based on the H5 from an Egyptian H5N1 virus and the N2 from an Egyptian H9N2 virus on a PR8 backbone. This strain had better replication rates than an H5N2 reassortant strain on an H9N2 backbone and an H5N1 reassortant on a PR8 backbone. This virus was then used to develop a killed, oil-emulsion vaccine and tested for efficacy against H5N1 and H9N2 viruses in chickens. Results showed that this vaccine was immunogenic and reduced mortality and shedding.Our findings suggest that an inactivated PR8-derived H5N2 influenza vaccine is efficacious in poultry against H5N1 and H9N2 viruses and the vaccine seed replicates at a high rate thus improving vaccine production."
1,European bats as carriers of viruses with zoonotic potential.,"Bats are being increasingly recognized as reservoir hosts of highly pathogenic and zoonotic emerging viruses (Marburg virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Rabies virus, and coronaviruses). While numerous studies have focused on the mentioned highly human-pathogenic bat viruses in tropical regions, little is known on similar human-pathogenic viruses that may be present in European bats. Although novel viruses are being detected, their zoonotic potential remains unclear unless further studies are conducted. At present, it is assumed that the risk posed by bats to the general public is rather low. In this review, selected viruses detected and isolated in Europe are discussed from our point of view in regard to their human-pathogenic potential. All European bat species and their roosts are legally protected and some European species are even endangered. Nevertheless, the increasing public fear of bats and their viruses is an obstacle to their protection. Educating the public regarding bat lyssaviruses might result in reduced threats to both the public and the bats. "
1,Strengthening the Interaction of the Virology Community with the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) by Linking Virus Names and Their Abbreviations to Virus Species.,"The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is tasked with classifying viruses into taxa (orders to species) and devising taxon names. Virus names and virus name abbreviations are currently not within the ICTV's official remit and are not regulated by an official entity. Many scientists, medical/veterinary professionals, and regulatory agencies do not address evolutionary questions nor are they concerned with the hierarchical organization of the viral world and therefore have limited use for ICTV-devised taxa. Instead, these professionals look to the ICTV as an expert point source that provides the most current taxonomic affiliations of viruses of interests to facilitate document writing. These needs are currently unmet as an ICTV-supported, easily-searchable database that includes all published virus names and abbreviations linked to their taxa is not available. In addition, in stark contrast to other biological taxonomic frameworks, virus taxonomy currently permits individual species to have several members. Consequently, confusion emerges among those who are not aware of the difference between taxa and viruses, and because certain well-known viruses cannot be located in ICTV publications or be linked to their species. In addition, the number of duplicate names and abbreviations has increased dramatically in the literature. To solve this conundrum, the ICTV could mandate listing all viruses of established species and all reported unclassified viruses in forthcoming online ICTV Reports and create a searchable webpage using this information. The International Union of Microbiology Societies could also consider changing the mandate of the ICTV to include the nomenclature of all viruses in addition to taxon considerations. With such a mandate expansion, official virus names and name abbreviations could be catalogued and virus nomenclature could be standardized. As a result, the ICTV would become an even more useful resource for all stakeholders in virology."
1,Comprehensive Surveys of Bean common mosaic virus and Bean common mosaic necrosis virus and Molecular Evidence for Occurrence of Other Phaseolus vulgaris Viruses in Tanzania.,"Virus diseases are among the main biotic factors constraining common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production in Tanzania. Disease management requires information on types, distribution, incidence, and genetic variation of the causal viruses, which is currently limited. Thus, a countrywide comprehensive survey was conducted. Use of a next-generation sequencing technique enabled simultaneous detection of 15 viruses belonging to 11 genera. De novo assembly resulted in many contigs, including complete or nearly complete sequences of Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV), and Southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV). Some viruses (for example, SBMV and Tomato leaf curl Uganda virus-related begomovirus) were detected for the first time in common bean in Tanzania. Visually assessed virus-like disease incidence ranged from 0 to 98% but reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-based incidence of BCMV and BCMNV (7,756 samples) was mostly less than 40%. The Sanger-based nucleotide sequences encoding coat proteins of BCMV and BCMNV isolates were 90.2 to 100% and 97.1 to 100% identical to each other, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BCMV isolates were more diverse than BCMNV isolates. The information generated in this study will contribute to the development of molecular diagnostic tools and strategies for management of virus diseases nationally and internationally.

1,"The use of pseudotypes to study viruses, virus sero-epidemiology and vaccination.","The globalization of the world's economies, accompanied by increasing international travel, changing climates, altered human behaviour and demographics is leading to the emergence of different viral diseases, many of which are highly pathogenic and hence are considered of great public and animal health importance. To undertake basic research and therapeutic development, many of these viruses require handling by highly trained staff in BSL-3/4 facilities not readily available to the majority of the global R&D community. In order to circumvent the enhanced biosafety requirement, the development of non-pathogenic, replication-defective pseudotyped viruses is an effective and established solution to permit the study of many aspects of virus biology in a low containment biosafety level (BSL)-1/2 laboratory. Under the spectre of the unfolding Ebola crisis, this timely conference (the second to be organised by the Viral Pseudotype Unit, www.viralpseudotypeunit.info*) discusses the recent advances in pseudotype technology and how it is revolutionizing the study of important human and animal pathogens (human and avian influenza viruses, rabies/lyssaviruses, HIV, Marburg and Ebola viruses). Key topics addressed in this conference include the exploitation of pseudotypes for serology and serosurveillance, immunogenicity testing of current and next-generation vaccines and new pseudotype assay formats (multiplexing, kit development). The first pseudotype-focused Euroscicon conference organised by the Viral Pseudotype Unit was recently reviewed [1]."
1,The first phlebo-like virus infecting plants: a case study on the adaptation of negative-stranded RNA viruses to new hosts.,"A novel negative-stranded (ns) RNA virus associated with a severe citrus disease reported more than 80 years ago has been identified. Transmission electron microscopy showed that this novel virus, tentatively named citrus concave gum-associated virus, is flexuous and non-enveloped. Notwithstanding, its two genomic RNAs share structural features with members of the genus Phlebovirus, which are enveloped arthropod-transmitted viruses infecting mammals, and with a group of still unclassified phlebo-like viruses mainly infecting arthropods. CCGaV genomic RNAs code for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a nucleocapsid protein and a putative movement protein showing structural and phylogenetic relationships with phlebo-like viruses, phleboviruses and the unrelated ophioviruses, respectively, thus providing intriguing evidence of a modular genome evolution. Phylogenetic reconstructions identified an invertebrate-restricted virus as the most likely ancestor of this virus, revealing that its adaptation to plants was independent from and possibly predated that of the other nsRNA plant viruses. These data are consistent with an evolutionary scenario in which trans-kingdom adaptation occurred several times during the history of nsRNA viruses and followed different evolutionary pathways, in which genomic RNA segments were gained or lost. The need to create a new genus for this bipartite nsRNA virus and the impact of the rapid and specific detection methods developed here on citrus sanitation and certification are also discussed."
1,A two dose immunization with an inactivated reassortant H5N2 virus protects chickens against lethal challenge with homologous 2.3.2.1 clade and heterologous 2.2 clade highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses.,"The present study was aimed at generating a reassortant vaccine candidate virus with clade 2.3.2.1 Hemagglutinin (HA) and its evaluation in a challenge study for protection against homologous (2.3.2.1 clade) and heterologous (2.2 clade) highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses. Plasmid-based reverse genetics technique was used to rescue a 5?€?+?€?3 reassortant H5N2 strain containing the modified HA of H5N1 (clade 2.3.2.1), the Neuraminidase (NA) of H9N2, the Matrix (M) of H5N1 and the internal genes of A/WSN/33 H1N1. In addition, another 6?€?+?€?2 reassortant virus containing modified HA from H5N1 (clade 2.3.2.1), the NA from H9N2 and the internal genes of A/WSN/33 H1N1 was also rescued. The 5?€?+?€?3 reassortant H5N2 virus could grow to a higher titer in both MDCK cells and chicken eggs compared to the 6?€?+?€?2 reassortant H5N2 virus. The vaccine containing the inactivated 5?€?+?€?3 reassortant H5N2 virus was used in a two-dose immunization regime which protected specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens against two repeated challenges with homologous 2.3.2.1 clade and heterologous 2.2 clade HPAI H5N1 viruses. The 5?€?+?€?3 reassortant H5N2 virus based on clade 2.3.2.1 generated in this study can be effective in protecting chickens in the case of an outbreak caused by antigenically different clade 2.2 HPAI H5N1 viruses and opens the way to explore its applicability as potential vaccine candidate especially in the Asian countries reporting these clades frequently. The study also indicates that sequential immunization can broaden protection level against antigenically diverse strains of H5N1 viruses."
1,"Varroa destructor Macula-like virus, Lake Sinai virus and other new RNA viruses in wild bumblebee hosts (Bombus pascuorum, Bombus lapidarius and Bombus pratorum).","Pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in decline worldwide which poses a threat not only for ecosystem biodiversity but also to human crop production services. One main cause of pollinator decline may be the infection and transmission of diseases including RNA viruses. Recently, new viruses have been discovered in honeybees, but information on the presence of these in wild bumblebees is largely not available. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of new RNA viruses in Bombus species, and can report for the first time Varroa destructor Macula-like virus (VdMLV) and Lake Sinai virus (LSV) infection in multiple wild bumblebee hosts of Bombus pascuorum, Bombus lapidarius and Bombus pratorum. We sampled in 4 locations in Flanders, Belgium. Besides, we confirmed Slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV) in wild bumblebees, but no positive samples were obtained for Big Sioux river virus (BSRV). Secondly, we screened for the influence of apiaries on the prevalence of these viruses. Our results indicated a location effect for the prevalence of VdMLV in Bombus species, with a higher prevalence in the proximity of honeybee apiaries mainly observed in one location. For LSV, the prevalence was not different in the proximity or at a 1.5 km-distance of apiaries, but we reported a different isolate with similarities to LSV-2 and ""LSV-clade A"" as described by Ravoet et al. (2015), which was detected both in Apis mellifera and Bombus species. In general, our results indicate the existence of a disease pool of new viruses that seems to be associated to a broad range of Apoidae hosts, including multiple Bombus species."
1,"Viruses of Eukaryotic Algae: Diversity, Methods for Detection, and Future Directions.","The scope for ecological studies of eukaryotic algal viruses has greatly improved with the development of molecular and bioinformatic approaches that do not require algal cultures. Here, we review the history and perceived future opportunities for research on eukaryotic algal viruses. We begin with a summary of the 65 eukaryotic algal viruses that are presently in culture collections, with emphasis on shared evolutionary traits (e.g., conserved core genes) of each known viral type. We then describe how core genes have been used to enable molecular detection of viruses in the environment, ranging from PCR-based amplification to community scale ""-omics"" approaches. Special attention is given to recent studies that have employed network-analyses of -omics data to predict virus-host relationships, from which a general bioinformatics pipeline is described for this type of approach. Finally, we conclude with acknowledgement of how the field of aquatic virology is adapting to these advances, and highlight the need to properly characterize new virus-host systems that may be isolated using preliminary molecular surveys. Researchers can approach this work using lessons learned from the <i>Chlorella</i> virus system, which is not only the best characterized algal-virus system, but is also responsible for much of the foundation in the field of aquatic virology."
1,Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent Viruses Compensate for Microbial Metabolism in Virus-Host Interactions.,"Viruses are believed to be responsible for the mortality of host organisms. However, some recent investigations reveal that viruses may be essential for host survival. To date, it remains unclear whether viruses are beneficial or harmful to their hosts. To reveal the roles of viruses in the virus-host interactions, viromes and microbiomes of sediment samples from three deep-sea hydrothermal vents were explored in this study. To exclude the influence of exogenous DNAs on viromes, the virus particles were purified with nuclease (DNase I and RNase A) treatments and cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. The metagenomic analysis of viromes without exogenous DNA contamination and microbiomes of vent samples indicated that viruses had compensation effects on the metabolisms of their host microorganisms. Viral genes not only participated in most of the microbial metabolic pathways but also formed branched pathways in microbial metabolisms, including pyrimidine metabolism; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; nitrogen metabolism and assimilation pathways of the two-component system; selenocompound metabolism; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. As is well known, deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems exist in relatively isolated environments which are barely influenced by other ecosystems. The metabolic compensation of hosts mediated by viruses might represent a very important aspect of virus-host interactions.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the oceans and have very important roles in regulating microbial community structure and biogeochemical cycles. The relationship between virus and host microbes is broadly thought to be that of predator and prey. Viruses can lyse host cells to control microbial population sizes and affect community structures of hosts by killing specific microbes. However, viruses also influence their hosts through manipulation of bacterial metabolism. We found that viral genes not only participated in most microbial metabolic pathways but also formed branched pathways in microbial metabolisms. The metabolic compensation of hosts mediated by viruses may help hosts to adapt to extreme environments and may be essential for host survival."

1,Recent progress on gene silencing/suppression by virus-derived small interfering RNAs in rice viruses especially Rice grassy stunt virus.,"Noncoding RNAs play essential functions during epigenetic regulation of gene expression and development in numerous organisms. Three type of small noncoding RNAs found in eukaryotes, which are small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Small RNAs (sRNAs) originated from infecting viruses are known as virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs), are responsible for RNA silencing in plants. However, Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is mainly dependent on RNA silencing (RNAi). Interestingly, RNA silencing happens in plants and insects during viral infections. VsiRNAs originate from dsRNA molecules which further require hosts Dicer-like (DCL) proteins, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) proteins, and Argonaute (AGO) proteins. RdRP uses ssRNA for complete RNA amplification process as well as DCL dependent secondary vsiRNA formation. Viral Suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) interfere with the movement of signals during silencing mechanism. Moreover, intercellular movement of viruses is facilitated by virus-encoded movement proteins. Proteomic and Transcriptomic mechanisms regulated by specific factors like microRNAs, which has become an essential factor of gene regulation. RNAi is also involved in gene suppression by regulating the transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression in many eukaryotes. Rice grassy stunt virus (RGSV) is a member of genus Tenuivirus. Although, there is no much work done on RGSV, but this virus has become very potent and destructive, and effects rice crop in many Asian countries, particularly in China. In this review, we have highlighted the rice viruses' biology and silencing suppressors. This work will be helpful for plant virologists in understanding the role of vsiRNAs mechanism in rice viruses especially RGSV."
1,Collection of Viable Aerosolized Influenza Virus and Other Respiratory Viruses in a Student Health Care Center through Water-Based Condensation Growth.,"The dynamics and significance of aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses are still controversial, for the major reasons that virus aerosols are inefficiently collected by commonly used air samplers and that the collected viruses are inactivated by the collection method. Without knowledge of virus viability, infection risk analyses lack accuracy. This pilot study was performed to (i) determine whether infectious (viable) respiratory viruses in aerosols could be collected from air in a real world environment by the <i>vi</i>able <i>v</i>irus <i>a</i>erosol <i>s</i>ampler (VIVAS), (ii) compare and contrast the efficacy of the standard bioaerosol sampler, the BioSampler, with that of the VIVAS for the collection of airborne viruses in a real world environment, and (iii) gain insights for the use of the VIVAS for respiratory virus sampling. The VIVAS operates via a water vapor condensation process to enlarge aerosolized virus particles to facilitate their capture. A variety of viable human respiratory viruses, including influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses, were collected by the VIVAS located at least 2??m from seated patients, during a late-onset 2016 influenza virus outbreak. Whereas the BioSampler when operated following our optimized parameters also collected virus aerosols, it was nevertheless overall less successful based on a lower frequency of virus isolation in most cases. This side-by-side comparison highlights some limitations of past studies based on impingement-based sampling, which may have generated false-negative results due to either poor collection efficiency and/or virus inactivation due to the collection process. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The significance of virus aerosols in the natural transmission of respiratory diseases has been a contentious issue, primarily because it is difficult to collect or sample virus aerosols using currently available air sampling devices. We tested a new air sampler based on water vapor condensation for efficient sampling of viable airborne respiratory viruses in a student health care center as a model of a real world environment. The new sampler outperformed the industry standard device (the SKC BioSampler) in the collection of natural virus aerosols and in maintaining virus viability. These results using the VIVAS indicate that respiratory virus aerosols are more prevalent and potentially pose a greater inhalation biohazard than previously thought. The VIVAS thus appears to be a useful apparatus for microbiology air quality tests related to the detection of viable airborne viruses."
1,Archaeal Haloarcula californiae Icosahedral Virus 1 Highlights Conserved Elements in Icosahedral Membrane-Containing DNA Viruses from Extreme Environments.,"Despite their high genomic diversity, all known viruses are structurally constrained to a limited number of virion morphotypes. One morphotype of viruses infecting bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes is the tailless icosahedral morphotype with an internal membrane. Although it is considered an abundant morphotype in extreme environments, only seven such archaeal viruses are known. Here, we introduce Haloarcula californiae icosahedral virus 1 (HCIV-1), a halophilic euryarchaeal virus originating from salt crystals. HCIV-1 also retains its infectivity under low-salinity conditions, showing that it is able to adapt to environmental changes. The release of progeny virions resulting from cell lysis was evidenced by reduced cellular oxygen consumption, leakage of intracellular ATP, and binding of an indicator ion to ruptured cell membranes. The virion contains at least 12 different protein species, lipids selectively acquired from the host cell membrane, and a 31,314-bp-long linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The overall genome organization and sequence show high similarity to the genomes of archaeal viruses in the Sphaerolipoviridae family. Phylogenetic analysis based on the major conserved components needed for virion assembly-the major capsid proteins and the packaging ATPase-placed HCIV-1 along with the alphasphaerolipoviruses in a distinct, well-supported clade. On the basis of its virion morphology and sequence similarities, most notably, those of its core virion components, we propose that HCIV-1 is a member of the PRD1-adenovirus structure-based lineage together with other sphaerolipoviruses. This addition to the lineage reinforces the notion of the ancient evolutionary links observed between the viruses and further highlights the limits of the choices found in nature for formation of a virion.Under conditions of extreme salinity, the majority of the organisms present are archaea, which encounter substantial selective pressure, being constantly attacked by viruses. Regardless of the enormous viral sequence diversity, all known viruses can be clustered into a few structure-based viral lineages based on their core virion components. Our description of a new halophilic virus-host system adds significant insights into the largely unstudied field of archaeal viruses and, in general, of life under extreme conditions. Comprehensive molecular characterization of HCIV-1 shows that this icosahedral internal membrane-containing virus exhibits conserved elements responsible for virion organization. This places the virus neatly in the PRD1-adenovirus structure-based lineage. HCIV-1 further highlights the limited diversity of virus morphotypes despite the astronomical number of viruses in the biosphere. The observed high conservation in the core virion elements should be considered in addressing such fundamental issues as the origin and evolution of viruses and their interplay with their hosts."
1,Development of high-yield influenza B virus vaccine viruses.,"The burden of human infections with influenza A and B viruses is substantial, and the impact of influenza B virus infections can exceed that of influenza A virus infections in some seasons. Over the past few decades, viruses of two influenza B virus lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) have circulated in humans, and both lineages are now represented in influenza vaccines, as recommended by the World Health Organization. Influenza B virus vaccines for humans have been available for more than half a century, yet no systematic efforts have been undertaken to develop high-yield candidates. Therefore, we screened virus libraries possessing random mutations in the six ""internal"" influenza B viral RNA segments [i.e., those not encoding the major viral antigens, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase NA)] for mutants that confer efficient replication. Candidate viruses that supported high yield in cell culture were tested with the HA and NA genes of eight different viruses of the Victoria and Yamagata lineages. We identified combinations of mutations that increased the titers of candidate vaccine viruses in mammalian cells used for human influenza vaccine virus propagation and in embryonated chicken eggs, the most common propagation system for influenza viruses. These influenza B virus vaccine backbones can be used for improved vaccine virus production."
1,Emetine inhibits replication of RNA and DNA viruses without generating drug-resistant virus variants.,"At a noncytotoxic concentration, emetine was found to inhibit replication of DNA viruses [buffalopoxvirus (BPXV) and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1)] as well as RNA viruses [peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV)]. Using the time-of-addition and virus step-specific assays, we showed that emetine treatment resulted in reduced synthesis of viral RNA (PPRV and NDV) and DNA (BPXV and BHV-1) as well as inhibiting viral entry (NDV and BHV-1). In addition, emetine treatment also resulted in decreased synthesis of viral proteins. In a cell free endogenous viral polymerase assay, emetine was found to significantly inhibit replication of NDV, but not BPXV genome, suggesting that besides directly inhibiting specific viral polymerases, emetine may also target other factors essentially required for efficient replication of the viral genome. Moreover, emetine was found to significantly inhibit BPXV-induced pock lesions on chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) along with associated mortality of embryonated chicken eggs. At a lethal dose 50 (LD<sub>50</sub>) of 126.49 ng/egg and at an effective concentration 50 (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 3.03 ng/egg, the therapeutic index of the emetine against BPXV was determined to be 41.74. Emetine was also found to significantly delay NDV-induced mortality in chicken embryos associated with reduced viral titers. Further, emetine-resistant mutants were not observed upon long-term (P??=??25) sequential passage of BPXV and NDV in cell culture. Collectively, we have extended the effective antiviral activity of emetine against diverse groups of DNA and RNA viruses and propose that emetine could provide significant therapeutic value against some of these viruses without inducing an antiviral drug-resistant phenotype."
1,"Curating viscoelastic properties of icosahedral viruses, virus-based nanomaterials, and protein cages.","The beauty, symmetry, and functionality of icosahedral virus capsids has attracted the attention of biologists, physicists, and mathematicians ever since they were first observed. Viruses and protein cages assemble into functional architectures in a range of sizes, shapes, and symmetries. To fulfill their biological roles, these structures must self-assemble, resist stress, and are often dynamic. The increasing use of icosahedral capsids and cages in materials science has driven the need to quantify them in terms of structural properties such as rigidity, stiffness, and viscoelasticity. In this study, we employed Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation technology (QCM-D) to characterize and compare the mechanical rigidity of different protein cages and viruses. We attempted to unveil the relationships between rigidity, radius, shell thickness, and triangulation number. We show that the rigidity and triangulation numbers are inversely related to each other and the comparison of rigidity and radius also follows the same trend. Our results suggest that subunit orientation, protein-protein interactions, and protein-nucleic acid interactions are important for the resistance to deformation of these complexes, however, the relationships are complex and need to be explored further. The QCM-D based viscoelastic measurements presented here help us elucidate these relationships and show the future prospect of this technique in the field of physical virology and nano-biotechnology."
1,Progress toward an enhanced vaccine: Eight marked attenuated viruses to porcine reproductive and respiratory disease virus.,"Recombinant viruses of strain Ingelvac?? PRRS porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) modified live virus vaccine were produced with two individual small in-frame deletions in nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2; ??23 and ??87) and also the same deletions supplanted with foreign tags (??23-V5, ??23-FLAG, ??23-S, ??87-V5, ??87-FLAG, ??87-S). The viruses, but one (??87-FLAG), were stable for 10 passages and showed minimal effects on in vitro growth. Northern hybridization showed that the ??23-tagged probe detected intracellular viral genome RNA as well as shorter RNAs that may represent heteroclite species, while the ??87-tagged probe detected predominantly only genome length RNAs. When the tagged viruses were used to probe nsp2 protein in infected cells, perinuclear localization similar to native nsp2 was seen. Dual infection of ??23-S and ??87-S viruses allowed some discrimination of individual tagged nsp2 protein, facilitating future research. The mutants could potentially also be used to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals."
1,The Pandemic Threat of Emerging H5 and H7 Avian Influenza Viruses.,"The 1918 H1N1 Spanish Influenza pandemic was the most severe pandemic in modern history. Unlike more recent pandemics, most of the 1918 H1N1 virus' genome was derived directly from an avian influenza virus. Recent avian-origin H5 A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (GsGd) and Asian H7N9 viruses have caused several hundred human infections with high mortality rates. While these viruses have not spread beyond infected individuals, if they evolve the ability to transmit efficiently from person-to-person, specifically via the airborne route, they will initiate a pandemic. Therefore, this review examines H5 GsGd and Asian H7N9 viruses that have caused recent zoonotic infections with a focus on viral properties that support airborne transmission. Several GsGd H5 and Asian H7N9 viruses display molecular changes that potentiate transmission and/or exhibit ability for limited transmission between ferrets. However, the hemagglutinin of these viruses is unstable; this likely represents the most significant obstacle to the emergence of a virus capable of efficient airborne transmission. Given the global disease burden of an influenza pandemic, continued surveillance and pandemic preparedness efforts against H5 GsGd and Asian lineage H7N9 viruses are warranted."
1,Long-term evolution of viruses: A Janus-faced balance.,"The popular textbook image of viruses as noxious and selfish genetic parasites greatly underestimates the beneficial contributions of viruses to the biosphere. Given the crucial dependency of viruses to reproduce in an intracellular environment, viruses that engage in excessive killing (lysis) can drive their cellular hosts to extinction and will not survive. The lytic mode of virus propagation must, therefore, be tempered and balanced by non-lytic modes of virus latency and symbiosis. Here, we review recent bioinformatics and metagenomic studies to argue that viral endogenization and domestication may be more frequent mechanisms of virus persistence than lysis. We use a triangle diagram to explain the three major virus persistence strategies that explain the global scope of virus-cell interactions including lysis, latency and virus-cell symbiosis. This paradigm can help identify novel directions in virology research where scientists could artificially gain control over switching lytic and beneficial viral lifestyles. Also see the Video Abstract: http://youtu.be/GwXWz4N8o8."
1,Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 blocks fusion of sensitive but not resistant viruses by partitioning into virus-carrying endosomes.,"Late endosome-resident interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits fusion of diverse viruses, including Influenza A virus (IAV), by a poorly understood mechanism. Despite the broad antiviral activity of IFITM3, viruses like Lassa virus (LASV), are fully resistant to its inhibitory effects. It is currently unclear whether resistance arises from a highly efficient fusion machinery that is capable of overcoming IFITM3 restriction or the ability to enter from cellular sites devoid of this factor. Here, we constructed and validated a functional IFITM3 tagged with EGFP or other fluorescent proteins. This breakthrough allowed live cell imaging of virus co-trafficking and fusion with endosomal compartments in cells expressing fluorescent IFITM3. Three-color single virus and endosome tracking revealed that sensitive (IAV), but not resistant (LASV), viruses become trapped within IFITM3-positive endosomes where they underwent hemifusion but failed to release their content into the cytoplasm. IAV fusion with IFITM3-containing compartments could be rescued by amphotericin B treatment, which has been previously shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of this protein. By comparison, virtually all LASV particles trafficked and fused with endosomes lacking detectable levels of fluorescent IFITM3, implying that this virus escapes restriction by utilizing endocytic pathways that are distinct from the IAV entry pathways. The importance of virus uptake and transport pathways is further reinforced by the observation that LASV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion is inhibited by IFITM3 and other members of the IFITM family expressed in target cells. Together, our results strongly support a model according to which IFITM3 accumulation at the sites of virus fusion is a prerequisite for its antiviral activity and that this protein traps viral fusion at a hemifusion stage by preventing the formation of fusion pores. We conclude that the ability to utilize alternative endocytic pathways for entry confers IFITM3-resistance to otherwise sensitive viruses."
1,Interaction of Human Enteric Viruses with Microbial Compounds: Implication for Virus Persistence and Disinfection Treatments.,"Although the interaction between phages and bacteria has already been well described, it only recently emerged that human viruses also interact with bacteria in the mammalian gut. We studied whether this interaction could occur in tap water and thus confer enteric viruses protection against temperature and the classical disinfection treatments used in drinking water production. We demonstrated that the addition of lipopolysaccharide or peptidoglycan of bacterial origin to enterovirus provides thermal protection through stabilization of the viral capsid. This interaction plays a role when viruses are exposed to disinfection that targets the capsid, but less so when the virus genome is directly targeted. The interaction seems to be serotype-specific, suggesting that the capsid protein sequence could be important. The protection is linked to a direct association between viral particles and bacterial compounds as observed by microscopy. These results show that bacterial compounds present in the environment can affect virus inactivation."
1,Supplemented vaccination with tandem repeat M2e virus-like particles enhances protection against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5 viruses in chickens.,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 viruses derived from A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 have been continuously circulating globally, severely affecting the public health and poultry industries. The matrix 2 protein ectodomain (M2e) is considered a promising candidate for a universal cross-protective influenza vaccine that provides more effective control over HPAI H5 viruses harboring variant hemagglutinin (HA)-antigens. Here, we evaluated the protective efficacy of a tandem repeat construct of heterologous M2e presented on virus-like particles (M2e5x VLPs) either alone or as a supplement against HPAI H5 viruses in a chicken model. Chickens immunized with M2e5x VLPs alone induced M2e-specific antibodies but were not protected against HPAI H5. The homo- and cross-protective efficacy of M2e5x VLP-supplemented vaccination of chickens was also examined. Importantly, supplementation with M2e5x VLPs induced significantly higher levels of antibodies specific for M2e and different viruses as well as provided improved protection against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5 viruses. Considering the limited efficacy of inactivated vaccines, supplement vaccination with M2e5x VLPs may be an effective measure for preventing outbreaks of HPAI viruses that have the ability to constantly change their antigenic properties in poultry. "
1,Detection of pathogenic viruses in sewage provided early warnings of hepatitis A virus and norovirus outbreaks.,"Most persons infected with enterically transmitted viruses shed large amounts of virus in feces for days or weeks, both before and after onset of symptoms. Therefore, viruses causing gastroenteritis may be detected in wastewater, even if only a few persons are infected. In this study, the presence of eight pathogenic viruses (norovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, Aichi virus, parechovirus, hepatitis A virus [HAV], and hepatitis E virus) was investigated in sewage to explore whether their identification could be used as an early warning of outbreaks. Samples of the untreated sewage were collected in proportion to flow at Ryaverket, Gothenburg, Sweden. Daily samples collected during every second week between January and May 2013 were pooled and analyzed for detection of viruses by concentration through adsorption to milk proteins and PCR. The largest amount of noroviruses was detected in sewage 2 to 3 weeks before most patients were diagnosed with this infection in Gothenburg. The other viruses were detected at lower levels. HAV was detected between weeks 5 and 13, and partial sequencing of the structural VP1protein identified three different strains. Two strains were involved in an ongoing outbreak in Scandinavia and were also identified in samples from patients with acute hepatitis A in Gothenburg during spring of 2013. The third strain was unique and was not detected in any patient sample. The method used may thus be a tool to detect incipient outbreaks of these viruses and provide early warning before the causative pathogens have been recognized in health care. "
1,Special Issue: Honey Bee Viruses.,"Pollination of flowering plants is an important ecosystem service provided by wild insect pollinators and managed honey bees. Hence, losses and declines of pollinating insect species threaten human food security and are of major concern not only for apiculture or agriculture but for human society in general. Honey bee colony losses and bumblebee declines have attracted intensive research interest over the last decade and although the problem is far from being solved we now know that viruses are among the key players of many of these bee losses and bumblebee declines. With this special issue on bee viruses we, therefore, aimed to collect high quality original papers reflecting the current state of bee virus research. To this end, we focused on newly discovered viruses (Lake Sinai viruses, bee macula-like virus), or a so far neglected virus species (Apis mellifera filamentous virus), and cutting edge technologies (mass spectrometry, RNAi approach) applied in the field."
1,Influenza virus-like particles composed of conserved influenza proteins and GPI-anchored CCL28/GM-CSF fusion proteins enhance protective immunity against homologous and heterologous viruses.,"Influenza viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality and pose a substantial threat to public health. Vaccination represents the principle means of preventing influenza virus infection. Current vaccine approaches are hindered by the need to routinely reformulate vaccine compositions in an effort to account for the progressive antigenic changes that occur as influenza viruses circulate in the human population. In this study, we evaluated chimeric virus-like particle (cVLP) vaccines containing conserved elements of influenza proteins (HL5M2e (HA stem gene with 5M2e gene inserted) and NP), with or without glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CCL28 (GPI-CCL28) and/or GM-CSF (GPI-GM-CSF) fusion proteins as molecular adjuvants. cVLPs elicited strong humoral and cellular immune responses against homologous and heterologous viruses, and improved survival following lethal challenge with both homologous and heterologous viruses. Inclusion of GPI-anchored adjuvants in cVLP vaccines augmented the generation of influenza-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice in comparison to the non-adjuvanted cVLP vaccines. VLPs containing GPI-anchored adjuvants reduced morbidity and improved survival to lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous influenza viruses. This work suggests that VLP vaccines incorporating conserved influenza virus proteins and GPI-anchored molecular adjuvants may serve as a platform for a broadly protective ""universal"" influenza vaccine."
1,Influenza A virus targets a cGAS-independent STING pathway that controls enveloped RNA viruses.,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is known be involved in control of DNA viruses but has an unexplored role in control of RNA viruses. During infection with DNA viruses STING is activated downstream of cGAMP synthase (cGAS) to induce type I interferon. Here we identify a STING-dependent, cGAS-independent pathway important for full interferon production and antiviral control of enveloped RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). Further, IAV interacts with STING through its conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide (FP). Interestingly, FP antagonizes interferon production induced by membrane fusion or IAV but not by cGAMP or DNA. Similar to the enveloped RNA viruses, membrane fusion stimulates interferon production in a STING-dependent but cGAS-independent manner. Abolishment of this pathway led to reduced interferon production and impaired control of enveloped RNA viruses. Thus, enveloped RNA viruses stimulate a cGAS-independent STING pathway, which is targeted by IAV. "
1,"Oncogenic Viruses and Breast Cancer: Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV), Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV).","Although the risk factors for breast cancer are well established, namely female gender, early menarche and late menopause plus the protective influence of early pregnancy, the underlying causes of breast cancer remain unknown. The development of substantial recent evidence indicates that a handful of viruses may have a role in breast cancer. These viruses are mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), bovine leukemia virus (BLV), human papilloma viruses (HPVs), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV-also known as human herpes virus type 4). Each of these viruses has documented oncogenic potential. The aim of this review is to inform the scientific and general community about this recent evidence.MMTV and human breast cancer-the evidence is detailed and comprehensive but cannot be regarded as conclusive. BLV and human breast cancer-the evidence is limited. However, in view of the emerging information about BLV in human breast cancer, it is prudent to encourage the elimination of BLV in cattle, particularly in the dairy industry. HPVs and breast cancer-the evidence is substantial but not conclusive. The availability of effective preventive vaccines is a major advantage and their use should be encouraged. EBV and breast cancer-the evidence is also substantial but not conclusive. Currently, there are no practical means of either prevention or treatment. Although there is evidence of genetic predisposition, and cancer in general is a culmination of events, there is no evidence that inherited genetic traits are causal.The influence of oncogenic viruses is currently the major plausible hypothesis for a direct cause of human breast cancer."
1,Differences in the ease with which mutant viruses escape from human monoclonal antibodies against the HA stem of influenza A virus.,"Broadly protective human monoclonal antibodies that recognize the conserved epitopes in the HA of influenza A virus are being developed as therapeutic agents. Emergence of resistant viruses must always be considered when developing therapeutic agents against influenza.We examined human hetero-reactive mAbs against the HA stem of influenza A virus for the ease with which escape mutant viruses emerged.We attempted to generate the mutant viruses escaped from the hetero-reactive anti-HA stem antibodies. We also evaluated their protective efficacy, binding affinity, and epitopes.We obtained several human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that react with the HA of different HA subtypes of influenza A virus belonging to group 1. Upon attempting to generate escape mutant viruses, we found that the ease with which such viruses emerged differed among the mAbs; viruses barely escaped from two of the mAbs (clones S9-3-37 and F20C77), whereas escape from the third mAb (clone F5B7) occurred readily. Comparisons of the mAbs revealed that the HA stem epitopes, in vitro neutralization potency, binding affinity to H1-HA, and protective efficacy against lethal challenge with H1N1pdm09 virus were all comparable.These results demonstrate the importance of determining the ease with which escape mutant viruses emerge when evaluating anti-HA stem antibodies as antiviral agents during preclinical testing."
1,Record linkage study of the pathogen-specific burden of respiratory viruses in children.,"Reliance on hospital discharge diagnosis codes alone will likely underestimate the burden of respiratory viruses.To describe the epidemiology of respiratory viruses more accurately, we used record linkage to examine data relating to all children hospitalized in Western Australia between 2000 and 2012.We extracted hospital, infectious disease notification and laboratory data of a cohort of children born in Western Australia between 1996 and 2012. Laboratory records of respiratory specimens collected within 48??hours of admission were linked to hospitalization records. We calculated the frequency and rates of virus detection. To identify groups where under-ascertainment for respiratory viruses was greatest, we used logistic regression to determine factors associated with failure to test.Nine percentage of 484??992 admissions linked to a laboratory record for respiratory virus testing. While 62% (n??=??26??893) of laboratory-confirmed admissions received respiratory infection diagnosis codes, 38% (n??=??16??734) had other diagnoses, notably viral infection of unspecified sites. Of those tested, incidence rates were highest for respiratory syncytial virus (247 per 100??000 child-years) followed by parainfluenza (63 per 100??000 child-years). Admissions among older children and those without a respiratory diagnosis were associated with failure to test for respiratory viruses. Linked data can significantly enhance diagnostic codes when estimating the true burden of disease. In contrast to current emphasis on influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza were the most common viral pathogens among hospitalized children. By characterizing those failing to be tested, we can begin to quantify the under-ascertainment of respiratory viruses."
1,Evaluation of seasonal influenza vaccines for H1N1pdm09 and type B viruses based on a replication-incompetent PB2-KO virus.,"Vaccination is the first line of protection against influenza virus infection in humans. Although inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines are available, each vaccine has drawbacks in terms of immunogenicity and safety. To overcome these issues, our group has developed a replication-incompetent PB2-knockout (PB2-KO) influenza virus that replicates only in PB2-expressing cells. Here we generated PB2-KO viruses possessing the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments from H1N1pdm09 or type B viruses and tested their vaccine potential. The two PB2-KO viruses propagated efficiently in PB2-expressing cells, and expressed chimeric HA as expected. Virus-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in mice immunized with the viruses, and the immunized mice showed milder clinical signs and/or lower virus replication levels in the respiratory tract upon virus challenge. Our results indicate that these PB2-KO viruses have potential as vaccine candidates."
1,Identification and genome analysis of tomato chlorotic spot virus and dsRNA viruses from coinfected vegetables in the??Dominican Republic by high-throughput sequencing.,"The Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV) was first reported in the 1980s, having its occurrence limited to Brazil and Argentina. Due to an apparent mild severity in the past, molecular studies concerning TCSV were neglected. However, TCSV has disseminated over the USA and Caribbean countries. In Dominican Republic TCSV has been recently reported on important cultivated crops such as pepper and beans. In this work, we provide the first complete genome of a TCSV isolate from symptomatic plants in Dominican Republic, which was obtained by high-throughput sequencing. In addition, three dsRNA viruses from different virus families were identified coinfecting these plants Bell pepper endornavirus (BPEV), Southern tomato virus (STV) and Pepper cryptic virus 2 (PCV-2). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Dominican Republic TCSV isolate has a close relationship with other TCSV isolates and a reassortant isolate between TCSV and Groundnut ringspot virus (GRSV), all found in USA. BPEV, STV and PCV-2 isolates from Dominican Republic were close related to corresponding American isolates. The possible biological implications of these virus-mixed infections are discussed."
1,Evaluation of rapid and simple techniques for the enrichment of viruses prior to metagenomic virus discovery.,"The discovery of new or divergent viruses using metagenomics and high-throughput sequencing has become more commonplace. The preparation of a sample is known to have an effect on the representation of virus sequences within the metagenomic dataset yet comparatively little attention has been given to this. Physical enrichment techniques are often applied to samples to increase the number of viral sequences and therefore enhance the probability of detection. With the exception of virus ecology studies, there is a paucity of information available to researchers on the type of sample preparation required for a viral metagenomic study that seeks to identify an aetiological virus in an animal or human diagnostic sample. A review of published virus discovery studies revealed the most commonly used enrichment methods, that were usually quick and simple to implement, namely low-speed centrifugation, filtration, nuclease-treatment (or combinations of these) which have been routinely used but often without justification. These were applied to a simple and well-characterised artificial sample composed of bacterial and human cells, as well as DNA (adenovirus) and RNA viruses (influenza A and human enterovirus), being either non-enveloped capsid or enveloped viruses. The effect of the enrichment method was assessed by both quantitative real-time PCR and metagenomic analysis that incorporated an amplification step. Reductions in the absolute quantities of bacteria and human cells were observed for each method as determined by qPCR, but the relative abundance of viral sequences in the metagenomic dataset remained largely unchanged. A 3-step method of centrifugation, filtration and nuclease-treatment showed the greatest increase in the proportion of viral sequences. This study provides a starting point for the selection of a purification method in future virus discovery studies, and highlights the need for more data to validate the effect of enrichment methods on different sample types, amplification, bioinformatics approaches and sequencing platforms. This study also highlights the potential risks that may attend selection of a virus enrichment method without any consideration for the sample type being investigated. "
1,Comparison of Different <i>In Situ</i> Hybridization Techniques for the Detection of Various RNA and DNA Viruses.,"<i>In situ</i> hybridization (ISH) is a technique to determine potential correlations between viruses and lesions. The aim of the study was to compare ISH techniques for the detection of various viruses in different tissues. Tested RNA viruses include atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV) in the cerebellum of pigs, equine and bovine hepacivirus (EqHV, BovHepV) in the liver of horses and cattle, respectively, and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in the cerebrum of goats. Examined DNA viruses comprise canine bocavirus 2 (CBoV-2) in the intestine of dogs, porcine bocavirus (PBoV) in the spinal cord of pigs and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) in cerebrum, lymph node, and lung of pigs. ISH with self-designed digoxigenin-labelled RNA probes revealed a positive signal for SBV, CBoV-2, and PCV-2, whereas it was lacking for APPV, BovHepV, EqHV, and PBoV. Commercially produced digoxigenin-labelled DNA probes detected CBoV-2 and PCV-2, but failed to detect PBoV. ISH with a commercially available fluorescent ISH (FISH)-RNA probe mix identified nucleic acids of all tested viruses. The detection rate and the cell-associated positive area using the FISH-RNA probe mix was highest compared to the results using other probes and protocols, representing a major benefit of this method. Nevertheless, there are differences in costs and procedure time."
1,Inactivated Recombinant Rabies Viruses Displaying Canine Distemper Virus Glycoproteins Induce Protective Immunity against Both Pathogens.,"The development of multivalent vaccines is an attractive methodology for the simultaneous prevention of several infectious diseases in vulnerable populations. Both canine distemper virus (CDV) and rabies virus (RABV) cause lethal disease in wild and domestic carnivores. While RABV vaccines are inactivated, the live-attenuated CDV vaccines retain residual virulence for highly susceptible wildlife species. In this study, we developed recombinant bivalent vaccine candidates based on recombinant vaccine strain rabies virus particles, which concurrently display the protective CDV and RABV glycoprotein antigens. The recombinant viruses replicated to near-wild-type titers, and the heterologous glycoproteins were efficiently expressed and incorporated in the viral particles. Immunization of ferrets with beta-propiolactone-inactivated recombinant virus particles elicited protective RABV antibody titers, and animals immunized with a combination of CDV attachment protein- and fusion protein-expressing recombinant viruses were protected from lethal CDV challenge. However, animals that were immunized with only a RABV expressing the attachment protein of CDV vaccine strain Onderstepoort succumbed to infection with a more recent wild-type strain, indicating that immune responses to the more conserved fusion protein contribute to protection against heterologous CDV strains.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Rabies virus and canine distemper virus (CDV) cause high mortality rates and death in many carnivores. While rabies vaccines are inactivated and thus have an excellent safety profile and high stability, live-attenuated CDV vaccines can retain residual virulence in highly susceptible species. Here we generated recombinant inactivated rabies viruses that carry one of the CDV glycoproteins on their surface. Ferrets immunized twice with a mix of recombinant rabies viruses carrying the CDV fusion and attachment glycoproteins were protected from lethal CDV challenge, whereas all animals that received recombinant rabies viruses carrying only the CDV attachment protein according to the same immunization scheme died. Irrespective of the CDV antigens used, all animals developed protective titers against rabies virus, illustrating that a bivalent rabies virus-based vaccine against CDV induces protective immune responses against both pathogens."
1,"Phylogenetic characterization of circulating Dengue and Alkhumra Hemorrhagic Fever viruses in western Saudi Arabia and lack of evidence of Zika virus in the region: A retrospective study, 2010-2015.","Flaviviruses represent a global public health concern. They consist of ???70 viruses with almost half of them causing human diseases with unspecified febrile illnesses. Cities in western Saudi Arabia are endemic for viruses (DENV) with sporadic infections due to Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV). They also represent a major destination for travelers coming for annual religious pilgrimages (Hajj and Umrah) from all over the world. However, whether other flaviviruses are circulating is not known because of the limited number of surveillance studies. Here, we retrospectively screened 690 samples for flaviviruses in samples from patients with unexplained febrile illnesses between 2010 and 2015 in western Saudi Arabia using a pan-flaviviruses RT-PCR assay. Despite Zika virus RNA was not detected, this study confirms circulation and/or sporadic spread of DENV-2, DENV-3, and AHFV, higher prevalence of DENV-2, and a role for visitors from DENV endemic countries in DENV importation into the Kingdom. Further analysis also showed very low genetic diversity of AHFV confirming its slow microevolution. Accordingly, continuous and prospective surveillance for flaviviruses using such assay are warranted in Saudi Arabia which receives millions of Muslims annually to implement effective control measures in light of the global widespread and outbreaks of several flaviviruses."
1,Virus world as an evolutionary network of viruses and capsidless selfish elements.,"Viruses were defined as one of the two principal types of organisms in the biosphere, namely, as capsid-encoding organisms in contrast to ribosome-encoding organisms, i.e., all cellular life forms. Structurally similar, apparently homologous capsids are present in a huge variety of icosahedral viruses that infect bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. These findings prompted the concept of the capsid as the virus ""self"" that defines the identity of deep, ancient viral lineages. However, several other widespread viral ""hallmark genes"" encode key components of the viral replication apparatus (such as polymerases and helicases) and combine with different capsid proteins, given the inherently modular character of viral evolution. Furthermore, diverse, widespread, capsidless selfish genetic elements, such as plasmids and various types of transposons, share hallmark genes with viruses. Viruses appear to have evolved from capsidless selfish elements, and vice versa, on multiple occasions during evolution. At the earliest, precellular stage of life's evolution, capsidless genetic parasites most likely emerged first and subsequently gave rise to different classes of viruses. In this review, we develop the concept of a greater virus world which forms an evolutionary network that is held together by shared conserved genes and includes both bona fide capsid-encoding viruses and different classes of capsidless replicons. Theoretical studies indicate that selfish replicons (genetic parasites) inevitably emerge in any sufficiently complex evolving ensemble of replicators. Therefore, the key signature of the greater virus world is not the presence of a capsid but rather genetic, informational parasitism itself, i.e., various degrees of reliance on the information processing systems of the host."
1,Viruses causing lower respiratory symptoms in young children: findings from the ORChID birth cohort.,"Viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause substantial child morbidity. Sensitive molecular-based assays aid virus detection, but the clinical significance of positive tests remains uncertain as some viruses may be found in both acutely ill and healthy children. We describe disease-pathogen associations of respiratory viruses and quantify virus-specific attributable risk of ARIs in healthy children during the first 2?€?years of life.One hundred fifty-eight term newborn babies in Brisbane, Australia, were recruited progressively into a longitudinal, community-based, birth cohort study conducted between September 2010 and October 2014. A daily tick-box diary captured predefined respiratory symptoms from birth until their second birthday. Weekly parent-collected nasal swabs were batch-tested for 17 respiratory viruses by PCR assays, allowing calculation of virus-specific attributable fractions in the exposed (AFE) to determine the proportion of virus-positive children whose ARI symptoms could be attributed to that particular virus.Of 8100 nasal swabs analysed, 2646 (32.7%) were virus-positive (275 virus codetections, 3.4%), with human rhinoviruses accounting for 2058/2646 (77.8%) positive swabs. Viruses were detected in 1154/1530 (75.4%) ARI episodes and in 984/4308 (22.8%) swabs from asymptomatic periods. Respiratory syncytial virus (AFE: 68% (95% CI 45% to 82%)) and human metapneumovirus (AFE: 69% (95% CI 43% to 83%)) were strongly associated with higher risk of lower respiratory symptoms.The strong association of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus with ARIs and lower respiratory symptoms in young children managed within the community indicates successful development of vaccines against these two viruses should provide substantial health benefits."
1,Viral exploitation of the MEK/ERK pathway - A tale of vaccinia virus and other viruses.,"The VACV replication cycle is remarkable in the sense that it is performed entirely in the cytoplasmic compartment of vertebrate cells, due to its capability to encode enzymes required either for regulating the macromolecular precursor pool or the biosynthetic processes. Although remarkable, this gene repertoire is not sufficient to confer the status of a free-living microorganism to the virus, and, consequently, the virus relies heavily on the host to successfully generate its progeny. During the complex virus-host interaction, viruses must deal not only with the host pathways to accomplish their temporal demands but also with pathways that counteract viral infection, including the inflammatory, innate and acquired immune responses. This review focuses on VACV and other DNA or RNA viruses that stimulate the MEK (MAPK - Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase)/ERK- Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase) pathway as part of their replication cycle."
1,Systematic analysis of protein identity between Zika virus and other arthropod-borne viruses.,"To analyse the proportions of protein identity between Zika virus and dengue, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, West Nile and chikungunya viruses as well as polymorphism between different Zika virus strains.We used published protein sequences for the Zika virus and obtained protein sequences for the other viruses from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database or the NCBI virus variation resource. We used BLASTP to find regions of identity between viruses. We quantified the identity between the Zika virus and each of the other viruses, as well as within-Zika virus polymorphism for all amino acid <i>k</i>-mers across the proteome, with <i>k</i> ranging from 6 to 100. We assessed accessibility of protein fragments by calculating the solvent accessible surface area for the envelope and nonstructural-1 (NS1) proteins.In total, we identified 294 Zika virus protein fragments with both low proportion of identity with other viruses and low levels of polymorphisms among Zika virus strains. The list includes protein fragments from all Zika virus proteins, except NS3. NS4A has the highest number (190 <i>k</i>-mers) of protein fragments on the list.We provide a candidate list of protein fragments that could be used when developing a sensitive and specific serological test to detect previous Zika virus infections."
1,Neuraminidase as an enzymatic marker for detecting airborne Influenza virus and other viruses.,"Little information is available regarding the effectiveness of air samplers to collect viruses and regarding the effects of sampling processes on viral integrity. The neuraminidase enzyme is present on the surface of viruses that are of agricultural and medical importance. It has been demonstrated that viruses carrying this enzyme can be detected using commercial substrates without having to process the sample by methods such as RNA extraction. This project aims at evaluating the effects of 3 aerosol-sampling devices on the neuraminidase enzyme activity of airborne viruses. The purified neuraminidase enzymes from Clostridium perfringens, a strain of Influenza A (H1N1) virus, the FluMist influenza vaccine, and the Newcastle disease virus were used as models. The neuraminidase models were aerosolized in aerosol chambers and sampled with 3 different air samplers (SKC BioSampler, 3-piece cassettes with polycarbonate filters, and Coriolis ??) to assess the effect on neuraminidase enzyme activity. Our results demonstrated that Influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus neuraminidase enzymes are resistant to aerosolization and sampling with all air samplers tested. Moreover, we demonstrated that the enzymatic neuraminidase assay is as sensitive as RT-qPCR for detecting low concentrations of Influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus. Therefore, given the sensitivity of the assay and its compatibility with air sampling methods, viruses carrying the neuraminidase enzyme can be rapidly detected from air samples using neuraminidase activity assay without having to preprocess the samples."
1,Inhibition of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus by a peptide derived from vFLIP through its direct destabilization of viruses.,"The antiviral activities of synthesized K??2-helix peptide, which was derived from the viral FLICE-like inhibitor protein (vFLIP) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), against influenza A virus (IAV) were investigated in vitro and in vivo, and mechanisms of action were suggested. In addition to the robust autophagy activity of the K??2-helix peptide, the present study showed that treatment with the K??2 peptide fused with the TAT peptide significantly inhibited IAV replication and transmission. Moreover, TAT-K??2 peptide protected the mice, that were challenged with lethal doses of highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 or H1N1 viruses. Mechanistically, we found that TAT-K??2 peptide destabilized the viral membranes, depending on their lipid composition of the viral envelop. In addition to IAV, the K??2 peptide inhibited infections with enveloped viruses, such as Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), without cytotoxicity. These results suggest that TAT-K??2 peptide is a potential antiviral agent for controlling emerging or re-emerging enveloped viruses, particularly diverse subtypes of IAVs."
1,Optimization and validation of sample preparation for metagenomic sequencing of viruses in clinical samples.,"Sequence-specific PCR is the most common approach for virus identification in diagnostic laboratories. However, as specific PCR only detects pre-defined targets, novel virus strains or viruses not included in routine test panels will be missed. Recently, advances in high-throughput sequencing allow for virus-sequence-independent identification of entire virus populations in clinical samples, yet standardized protocols are needed to allow broad application in clinical diagnostics. Here, we describe a comprehensive sample preparation protocol for high-throughput metagenomic virus sequencing using random amplification of total nucleic acids from clinical samples.In order to optimize metagenomic sequencing for application in virus diagnostics, we tested different enrichment and amplification procedures on plasma samples spiked with RNA and DNA viruses. A protocol including filtration, nuclease digestion, and random amplification of RNA and DNA in separate reactions provided the best results, allowing reliable recovery of viral genomes and a good correlation of the relative number of sequencing reads with the virus input. We further validated our method by sequencing a multiplexed viral pathogen reagent containing a range of human viruses from different virus families. Our method proved successful in detecting the majority of the included viruses with high read numbers and compared well to other protocols in the field validated against the same reference reagent. Our sequencing protocol does work not only with plasma but also with other clinical samples such as urine and throat swabs.The workflow for virus metagenomic sequencing that we established proved successful in detecting a variety of viruses in different clinical samples. Our protocol supplements existing virus-specific detection strategies providing opportunities to identify atypical and novel viruses commonly not accounted for in routine diagnostic panels."
1,Avian Influenza Viruses in Wild Birds: Virus Evolution in a Multihost Ecosystem.,"Wild ducks and gulls are the major reservoirs for avian influenza A viruses (AIVs). The mechanisms that drive AIV evolution are complex at sites where various duck and gull species from multiple flyways breed, winter, or stage. The Republic of Georgia is located at the intersection of three migratory flyways: the Central Asian flyway, the East Africa/West Asia flyway, and the Black Sea/Mediterranean flyway. For six complete study years (2010 to 2016), we collected AIV samples from various duck and gull species that breed, migrate, and overwinter in Georgia. We found a substantial subtype diversity of viruses that varied in prevalence from year to year. Low-pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) subtypes included H1N1, H2N3, H2N5, H2N7, H3N8, H4N2, H6N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N1, H9N3, H10N4, H10N7, H11N1, H13N2, H13N6, H13N8, and H16N3, and two highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs) belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, H5N5 and H5N8, were found. Whole-genome phylogenetic trees showed significant host species lineage restriction for nearly all gene segments and significant differences in observed reassortment rates, as defined by quantification of phylogenetic incongruence, and in nucleotide sequence diversity for LPAIVs among different host species. Hemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses, which circulated in Eurasia during 2014 and 2015, did not reassort, but analysis after their subsequent dissemination during 2016 and 2017 revealed reassortment in all gene segments except NP and NS. Some virus lineages appeared to be unrelated to AIVs in wild bird populations in other regions, with maintenance of local AIVs in Georgia, whereas other lineages showed considerable genetic interrelationships with viruses circulating in other parts of Eurasia and Africa, despite relative undersampling in the area.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Waterbirds (e.g., gulls and ducks) are natural reservoirs of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and have been shown to mediate the dispersal of AIVs at intercontinental scales during seasonal migration. The segmented genome of influenza viruses enables viral RNA from different lineages to mix or reassort when two viruses infect the same host. Such reassortant viruses have been identified in most major human influenza pandemics and several poultry outbreaks. Despite their importance, we have only recently begun to understand AIV evolution and reassortment in their natural host reservoirs. This comprehensive study illustrates AIV evolutionary dynamics within a multihost ecosystem at a stopover site where three major migratory flyways intersect. Our analysis of this ecosystem over a 6-year period provides a snapshot of how these viruses are linked to global AIV populations. Understanding the evolution of AIVs in the natural host is imperative to mitigating both the risk of incursion into domestic poultry and the potential risk to mammalian hosts, including humans."
1,Elicitation of Protective Antibodies against 20 Years of Future H3N2 Cocirculating Influenza Virus Variants in Ferrets Preimmune to Historical H3N2 Influenza Viruses.,"The vast majority of people already have preexisting immune responses to influenza viruses from one or more subtypes. However, almost all preclinical studies evaluate new influenza vaccine candidates in immunologically naive animals. Recently, our group demonstrated that priming naive ferrets with broadly reactive H1 COBRA HA-based vaccines boosted preexisting antibodies induced by wild-type H1N1 virus infections. These H1 COBRA hemagglutinin (HA) antigens induced antibodies with HAI activity against multiple antigenically different H1N1 viral variants. In this study, ferrets, preimmune to historical H3N2 viruses, were vaccinated with virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines expressing either an HA from a wild-type H3 influenza virus or a COBRA H3 HA antigen (T6, T7, T10, or T11). The elicited antisera had the ability to neutralize virus infection against either a panel of viruses representing vaccine strains selected by the World Health Organization or a set of viral variants that cocirculated during the same time period. Preimmune animals vaccinated with H3 COBRA T10 HA antigen elicited sera with higher hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers than antisera elicited by VLP vaccines with wild-type HA VLPs in preimmune ferrets. However, while the T11 COBRA vaccine did not elicit HAI activity, the elicited antibodies did neutralize antigenically distinct H3N2 influenza viruses. Overall, H3 COBRA-based HA vaccines were able to neutralize both historical H3 and contemporary, as well as future, H3N2 viruses with higher titers than vaccines with wild-type H3 HA antigens. This is the first report demonstrating the effectiveness of a broadly reactive H3N3 vaccine in a preimmune ferret model.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> After exposure to influenza virus, the host generates neutralizing anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibodies against that specific infecting influenza strain. These antibodies can also neutralize some, but not all, cocirculating strains. The goal of next-generation influenza vaccines, such as HA head-based COBRA, is to stimulate broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against all strains circulating within a subtype, in particular those that persist over multiple influenza seasons, without requiring an update to the vaccine. To mimic the human condition, COBRA HA virus-like particle vaccines were tested in ferrets that were previously exposed to historical H3N2 influenza viruses. In this model, these vaccines elicited broadly protective antibodies that neutralized cocirculating H3N2 influenza viruses isolated over a 20-year period. This is the first study to show the effectiveness of H3N3 COBRA HA vaccines in a host with preexisting immunity to influenza."
1,Comparative genome analysis of Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus with Kyasanur forest disease and tick-borne encephalitis viruses by the in silico approach.,"Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV), a relatively new member of the Flaviviruses, was discovered in Saudi Arabia 23 years ago. AHFV is classified in the tick-borne encephalitis virus serocomplex, along with the Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Currently, very little is known about the pathologies of AHFV. In this study, using the available genome information of AHFV, KFDV and TBEV, we have predicted and compared the following aspects of these viruses: evolution, nucleotide and protein compositions, recombination, codon frequency, substitution rate, N- and O-glycosylation sites, signal peptide and cleavage site, transmembrane region, secondary structure of 5' and 3' UTRs and RNA-RNA interactions. Additionally, we have modeled the 3D protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase structures for AHFV, KFDV and TBEV. Recombination analysis showed no evidence of recombination in the AHFV genome with that of either KFDV or TBEV, although single break point analysis showed that nucleotide position 7399 (in the NS4B) is a breakpoint location. AHFV, KFDV and TBEV are very similar in terms of codon frequency, the number of transmembrane regions, properties of the polyprotein, RNA-RNA interaction sequences, NS3 protease and NS5 polymerase structures and 5' UTR structure. Using genome sequences, we showed the similarities between these closely- related viruses on several different areas."
1,"Isolation and Characterization of Metallosphaera Turreted Icosahedral Virus, a Founding Member of a New Family of Archaeal Viruses.","Our understanding of archaeal virus diversity and structure is just beginning to emerge. Here we describe a new archaeal virus, tentatively named Metallosphaera turreted icosahedral virus (MTIV), that was isolated from an acidic hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Two strains of the virus were identified and were found to replicate in an archaeal host species closely related to <i>Metallosphaera yellowstonensis</i> Each strain encodes a 9.8- to 9.9-kb linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome with large inverted terminal repeats. Each genome encodes 21 open reading frames (ORFs). The ORFs display high homology between the strains, but they are quite distinct from other known viral genes. The 70-nm-diameter virion is built on a T=28 icosahedral lattice. Both single particle cryo-electron microscopy and cryotomography reconstructions reveal an unusual structure that has 42 turret-like projections: 12 pentameric turrets positioned on the icosahedral 5-fold axes and 30 turrets with apparent hexameric symmetry positioned on the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Both the virion structural properties and the genome content support MTIV as the founding member of a new family of archaeal viruses.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Many archaeal viruses are quite different from viruses infecting bacteria and eukaryotes. Initial characterization of MTIV reveals a virus distinct from other known bacterial, eukaryotic, and archaeal viruses; this finding suggests that viruses infecting <i>Archaea</i> are still an understudied group. As the first known virus infecting a <i>Metallosphaera</i> sp., MTIV provides a new system for exploring archaeal virology by examining host-virus interactions and the unique features of MTIV structure-function relationships. These studies will likely expand our understanding of virus ecology and evolution."
1,Eradication of bovine viral diarrhea virus in Germany-Diversity of subtypes and detection of live-vaccine viruses.,"Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) causes high economic losses in the cattle population worldwide. In Germany, an obligatory control program with detection and removal of persistently infected animals is in force since 2011. For molecular tracing of virus transmission, a comprehensive sequence data base of the currently circulating BVD viruses was established. Partial sequences of 1007 samples collected between 2008 and 2016 were generated. As dominant viruses, subtypes 1b (47.0%) and 1d (26.5%) could be identified with no marked geographic or sampling year effect, a much higher amount of BVDV-2c was detected in 2013 compared to other years, predominantly in Western Germany. In addition, subtypes 1a, 1e, 1f, 1h, 1g, 1k, and 2a were found. Interestingly, besides field-viruses, two different live-vaccine viruses were detected in tissue samples of newborn calves (n=37) whose mothers were immunized during pregnancy."
1,His-tag based in situ labelling of progeny viruses for real-time single virus tracking in living cells.,"Tracking virus infection events in live cells is useful for understanding the mechanism of virus infection, and fluorescent labelling is a critical step. Herein a noninvasive strategy for labelling viruses with His-tags was developed by in situ modifying the cell surface proteins with polypeptides containing His-tags during progeny virus assembly. The His-tagged viruses were further conjugated with Ni<sup>2+</sup>-nitrilotriacetate complex modified quantum dots, and retained their infectivity for real-time single virus tracking in living cells."
1,A virus of hyperthermophilic archaea with a unique architecture among DNA viruses.,"Viruses package their genetic material in diverse ways. Most known strategies include encapsulation of nucleic acids into spherical or filamentous virions with icosahedral or helical symmetry, respectively. Filamentous viruses with dsDNA genomes are currently associated exclusively with Archaea. Here, we describe a filamentous hyperthermophilic archaeal virus, Pyrobaculum filamentous virus 1 (PFV1), with a type of virion organization not previously observed in DNA viruses. The PFV1 virion, 400 ?? 20 ?? 32 ?? 3 nm, contains an envelope and an inner core consisting of two structural units: a rod-shaped helical nucleocapsid formed of two 14-kDa major virion proteins and a nucleocapsid-encompassing protein sheath composed of a single major virion protein of 18 kDa. The virion organization of PFV1 is superficially similar to that of negative-sense RNA viruses of the family Filoviridae, including Ebola virus and Marburg virus. The linear dsDNA of PFV1 carries 17,714 bp, including 60-bp-long terminal inverted repeats, and contains 39 predicted ORFs, most of which do not show similarities to sequences in public databases. PFV1 is a lytic virus that completely disrupts the host cell membrane at the end of the infection cycle. "
1,Deep Sequencing Analysis of RNAs from Citrus Plants Grown in a Citrus Sudden Death-Affected Area Reveals Diverse Known and Putative Novel Viruses.,"Citrus sudden death (CSD) has caused the death of approximately four million orange trees in a very important citrus region in Brazil. Although its etiology is still not completely clear, symptoms and distribution of affected plants indicate a viral disease. In a search for viruses associated with CSD, we have performed a comparative high-throughput sequencing analysis of the transcriptome and small RNAs from CSD-symptomatic and -asymptomatic plants using the Illumina platform. The data revealed mixed infections that included Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) as the most predominant virus, followed by the Citrus sudden death-associated virus (CSDaV), Citrus endogenous pararetrovirus (CitPRV) and two putative novel viruses tentatively named Citrus jingmen-like virus (CJLV), and Citrus virga-like virus (CVLV). The deep sequencing analyses were sensitive enough to differentiate two genotypes of both viruses previously associated with CSD-affected plants: CTV and CSDaV. Our data also showed a putative association of the CSD-symptomatic plants with a specific CSDaV genotype and a likely association with CitPRV as well, whereas the two putative novel viruses showed to be more associated with CSD-asymptomatic plants. This is the first high-throughput sequencing-based study of the viral sequences present in CSD-affected citrus plants, and generated valuable information for further CSD studies."
1,Combined H5ND inactivated vaccine protects chickens against challenge by different clades of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses subtype H5 and virulent Newcastle disease virus.,"The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of a trivalent-inactivated oil-emulsion vaccine against challenge by different clades highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses including HPAI-H5N8 and the virulent genotype VII Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (vNDV).The vaccine studied herein is composed of reassortant AI viruses rgA/Chicken/Egypt/ME1010/2016 (clade 2.2.1.1), H5N1 rgA/Chicken/Egypt/RG-173CAL/2017 (clade 2.2.1.2), and ""NDV"" (LaSota NDV/CK/Egypt/11478AF/11); all used at a concentration of 10<sup>8</sup> EID<sub>50</sub>/bird and mixed with Montanide-ISA70 oil adjuvant. Two-week-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens were immunized subcutaneously with 0.5 ml of the vaccine, and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers were monitored weekly. The intranasal challenge was conducted 4 weeks post-vaccination (PV) using 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub>/0.1 ml of the different virulent HPAI-H5N1 viruses representing clades 2.2.1, 2.2.1.1, 2.2.1.2, 2.3.4.4b-H5N8, and the vNDV.The vaccine induced HI antibody titers of >6log<sub>2</sub> against both H5N1 and NDV viruses at 2 weeks PV. Clinical protection against all HPAI H5N1 viruses and vNDV was 100%, except for HPAI H5N1 clade-2.2.1 and HPAI H5N8 clade-2.3.4.4b viruses that showed 93.3% protection. Challenged SPF chickens showed significant decreases in the virus shedding titers up to <3log<sub>10</sub> compared to challenge control chickens. No virus shedding was detected 6 ""days post-challenge"" in all vaccinated challenged groups.Our results indicate that the trivalent H5ND vaccine provides significant clinical protection against different clades of the HPAI viruses including the newly emerging H5N8 HPAI virus. Availability of such potent multivalent oil-emulsion vaccine offers an effective tool against HPAI control in endemic countries and promises simpler vaccination programs."
1,Multisubunit DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases from Vaccinia Virus and Other Nucleocytoplasmic Large-DNA Viruses: Impressions from the Age of Structure.,"The past 17 years have been marked by a revolution in our understanding of cellular multisubunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (MSDDRPs) at the structural level. A parallel development over the past 15 years has been the emerging story of the giant viruses, which encode MSDDRPs. Here we link the two in an attempt to understand the specialization of multisubunit RNA polymerases in the domain of life encompassing the large nucleocytoplasmic DNA viruses (NCLDV), a superclade that includes the giant viruses and the biochemically well-characterized poxvirus vaccinia virus. The first half of this review surveys the recently determined structural biology of cellular RNA polymerases for a microbiology readership. The second half discusses a reannotation of MSDDRP subunits from NCLDV families and the apparent specialization of these enzymes by virus family and by subunit with regard to subunit or domain loss, subunit dissociability, endogenous control of polymerase arrest, and the elimination/customization of regulatory interactions that would confer higher-order cellular control. Some themes are apparent in linking subunit function to structure in the viral world: as with cellular RNA polymerases I and III and unlike cellular RNA polymerase II, the viral enzymes seem to opt for speed and processivity and seem to have eliminated domains associated with higher-order regulation. The adoption/loss of viral RNA polymerase proofreading functions may have played a part in matching intrinsic mutability to genome size."
1,Adoptive Transfer of Engineered Rhesus Simian Immunodeficiency Virus-Specific CD8+ T Cells Reduces the Number of Transmitted/Founder Viruses Established in Rhesus Macaques.,"AIDS virus infections are rarely controlled by cell-mediated immunity, in part due to viral immune evasion and immunodeficiency resulting from CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell infection. One likely aspect of this failure is that antiviral cellular immune responses are either absent or present at low levels during the initial establishment of infection. To test whether an extensive, timely, and effective response could reduce the establishment of infection from a high-dose inoculum, we adoptively transferred large numbers of T cells that were molecularly engineered with anti-simian immunodeficiency virus (anti-SIV) activity into rhesus macaques 3 days following an intrarectal SIV inoculation. To measure in vivo antiviral activity, we assessed the number of viruses transmitted using SIVmac239X, a molecularly tagged viral stock containing 10 genotypic variants, at a dose calculated to transmit 12 founder viruses. Single-genome sequencing of plasma virus revealed that the two animals receiving T cells expressing SIV-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) had significantly fewer viral genotypes than the two control animals receiving non-SIV-specific T cells (means of 4.0 versus 7.5 transmitted viral genotypes; P = 0.044). Accounting for the likelihood of transmission of multiple viruses of a particular genotype, the calculated means of the total number of founder viruses transmitted were 4.5 and 14.5 in the experimental and control groups, respectively (P = 0.021). Thus, a large antiviral T-cell response timed with virus exposure can limit viral transmission. The presence of strong, preexisting T-cell responses, including those induced by vaccines, might help prevent the establishment of infection at the lower-exposure doses in humans that typically transmit only a single virus.The establishment of AIDS virus infection in an individual is essentially a race between the spreading virus and host immune defenses. Cell-mediated immune responses induced by infection or vaccination are important contributors in limiting viral replication. However, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/SIV infection, the virus usually wins the race, irreversibly crippling the immune system before an effective cellular immune response is developed and active. We found that providing an accelerated response by adoptively transferring large numbers of antiviral T cells shortly after a high-dose mucosal inoculation, while not preventing infection altogether, limited the number of individual viruses transmitted. Thus, the presence of strong, preexisting T-cell responses, including those induced by vaccines, might prevent infection in humans, where the virus exposure is considerably lower."
1,"Double-Stranded RNA Is Detected by Immunofluorescence Analysis in RNA and DNA Virus Infections, Including Those by Negative-Stranded RNA Viruses.","Early biochemical studies of viral replication suggested that most viruses produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is essential for the induction of the host immune response. However, it was reported in 2006 that dsRNA could be detected by immunofluorescence antibody staining in double-stranded DNA and positive-strand RNA virus infections but not in negative-strand RNA virus infections. Other reports in the literature seemed to support these observations. This suggested that negative-strand RNA viruses produce little, if any, dsRNA or that more efficient viral countermeasures to mask dsRNA are mounted. Because of our interest in the use of dsRNA antibodies for virus discovery, particularly in pathological specimens, we wanted to determine how universal immunostaining for dsRNA might be in animal virus infections. We have detected the in situ formation of dsRNA in cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus, measles virus, influenza A virus, and Nyamanini virus, which represent viruses from different negative-strand RNA virus families. dsRNA was also detected in cells infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, an ambisense RNA virus, and minute virus of mice (MVM), a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) parvovirus, but not hepatitis B virus. Although dsRNA staining was primarily observed in the cytoplasm, it was also seen in the nucleus of cells infected with influenza A virus, Nyamanini virus, and MVM. Thus, it is likely that most animal virus infections produce dsRNA species that can be detected by immunofluorescence staining. The apoptosis induced in several uninfected cell lines failed to upregulate dsRNA formation.An effective antiviral host immune response depends on recognition of viral invasion and an intact innate immune system as a first line of defense. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a viral product essential for the induction of innate immunity, leading to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and the activation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. The present study demonstrates that infections, including those by ssDNA viruses and positive- and negative-strand RNA viruses, produce dsRNAs detectable by standard immunofluorescence staining. While dsRNA staining was primarily observed in the cytoplasm, nuclear staining was also present in some RNA and DNA virus infections. The nucleus is unlikely to have pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors for dsRNA because of the presence of host dsRNA molecules. Thus, it is likely that most animal virus infections produce dsRNA species detectable by immunofluorescence staining, which may prove useful in viral discovery as well."
1,The Battle of RNA Synthesis: Virus versus Host.,"Transcription control is the foundation of gene regulation. Whereas a cell is fully equipped for this task, viruses often depend on the host to supply tools for their transcription program. Over the course of evolution and adaptation, viruses have found diverse ways to optimally exploit cellular host processes such as transcription to their own benefit. Just as cells are increasingly understood to employ nascent RNAs in transcription regulation, recent discoveries are revealing how viruses use nascent RNAs to benefit their own gene expression. In this review, we first outline the two different transcription programs used by viruses, i.e., transcription (DNA-dependent) and RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Subsequently, we use the distinct stages (initiation, elongation, termination) to describe the latest insights into nascent RNA-mediated regulation in the context of each relevant stage."
1,Mosquito-Associated Viruses in China.,"Mosquitoes are classified into approximately 3500 species and further grouped into 41 genera. Epidemiologically, they are considered to be among the most important disease vectors in the world and they can harbor a wide variety of viruses. Several mosquito viruses are considered to be of significant medical importance and can cause serious public health issues throughout the world. Such viruses are Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Others are the newly recognized mosquito viruses such as Banna virus (BAV) and Yunnan orbivirus (YNOV) with unclear medical significance. The remaining mosquito viruses are those that naturally infect mosquitoes but do not appear to infect humans or other vertebrates. With the continuous development and improvement of mosquito and mosquito-associated virus surveillance systems in China, many novel mosquito-associated viruses have been discovered in recent years. This review aims to systematically outline the history, characteristics, distribution, and/or current epidemic status of mosquito-associated viruses in China."
1,Geometric Defects and Icosahedral Viruses.,"We propose that viruses with geometric defects are not necessarily flawed viruses. A geometric defect may be a reactive site. Defects may facilitate assembly, dissociation, or accessibility of cellular proteins to virion components. In single molecule studies of hepadnavirus assembly, defects and overgrowth are common features. Icosahedral alphaviruses and flaviviruses, among others, have capsids with geometric defects. Similarly, immature retroviruses, which are non-icosahedral, have numerous ""errors"". In many viruses, asymmetric exposure of interior features allows for regulated genome release or supports intracellular trafficking. In these viruses, the defects likely serve a biological function. Commonly used approaches for spherical virus structure determination use symmetry averaging, which obscures defects. We suggest that there are three classes of asymmetry: regular asymmetry as might be found in a tailed phage, irregular asymmetry as found, for example, in defects randomly trapped during assembly, and dynamic asymmetry due to Brownian dynamics of virus capsids. Awareness of their presence and recent advances in electron microscopy will allow unprecedented investigation of capsid irregularities to investigate their biological relevance."
1,"Helper T Cell Responses to Respiratory Viruses in the Lung: Development, Virus Suppression, and Pathogenesis.","The lung is an important line of defense that is exposed to respiratory infectious pathogens, including viruses. Lung epithelial cells and/or alveolar macrophages are initially targeted by respiratory viruses. Once respiratory viruses invade the cells of the lung, innate immunity is activated to inhibit viral replication. Innate immune signaling also activates virus-specific adaptive immune responses. The helper T cells play pivotal roles in the humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. Helper T cells are categorized into several distinct subsets (e.g., T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2, T<sub>FH</sub>, T<sub>H</sub>17, and Treg), differentiated by their corresponding signature cytokine production profiles. Helper T cells migrate into the airways and the lung after respiratory virus infections. The behavior of the helper T cells differs with each respiratory virus-in some cases, the response is beneficial; in other cases, it is harmful. Here, the general mechanisms underlying helper T cell responses to viral infections are summarized, and functions and reactions of the helper T cells against some respiratory viral infections are discussed. In influenza virus infections, T<sub>H</sub>1 cells, which regulate the cytotoxic T lymphocytes and IgG2 responses, are efficiently activated. T<sub>FH</sub> cells required for highly specific and memory humoral responses are also activated on influenza infections. In infections with respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus, T<sub>H</sub>2 cells develop in the lung and contribute to pathogenesis. In many cases, Treg cells inhibit excessive virus-specific T cell responses that can contribute to viral pathogenicity."
1,Construction of the influenza A virus transmission tree in a college-based population: co-transmission and interactions between influenza A viruses.,"Co-infection of different influenza A viruses is known to occur but how viruses interact within co-infection remains unknown. An outbreak in a college campus during the 2009 pandemic involved two subtypes of influenza A: persons infected with pandemic A/H1N1; persons infected with seasonal A/H3N2 viruses; and persons infected with both at the same time (co-infection). This provides data to analyse the possible interaction between influenza A viruses within co-infection.We extend a statistical inference method designed for outbreaks caused by one virus to that caused by two viruses. The method uses knowledge of which subtype each case is infected with (and whether they were co-infected), contact information and symptom onset date of each case in the influenza outbreak. We then apply it to construct the most likely transmission tree during the outbreak in the college campus.Analysis of the constructed transmission tree shows that the simultaneous presence of the two influenza viruses increases the infectivity and the transmissibility of A/H1N1 virus but whether it changes the infectivity of A/H3N2 is unclear. The estimation also shows that co-transmission of both subtypes from co-infection is low and therefore co-infection cannot be sustained on its own.This study suggests that influenza A viruses within co-infected patients can interact in some ways rather than transmit independently, and this can enhance the spread of influenza A virus infection."
1,Reverse genetics in high throughput: rapid generation of complete negative strand RNA virus cDNA clones and recombinant viruses thereof.,"Reverse genetics approaches are indispensable tools for proof of concepts in virus replication and pathogenesis. For negative strand RNA viruses (NSVs) the limited number of infectious cDNA clones represents a bottleneck as clones are often generated from cell culture adapted or attenuated viruses, with limited potential for pathogenesis research. We developed a system in which cDNA copies of complete NSV genomes were directly cloned into reverse genetics vectors by linear-to-linear RedE/T recombination. Rapid cloning of multiple rabies virus (RABV) full length genomes and identification of clones identical to field virus consensus sequence confirmed the approache's reliability. Recombinant viruses were recovered from field virus cDNA clones. Similar growth kinetics of parental and recombinant viruses, preservation of field virus characters in cell type specific replication and virulence in the mouse model were confirmed. Reduced titers after reporter gene insertion indicated that the low level of field virus replication is affected by gene insertions. The flexibility of the strategy was demonstrated by cloning multiple copies of an orthobunyavirus L genome segment. This important step in reverse genetics technology development opens novel avenues for the analysis of virus variability combined with phenotypical characterization of recombinant viruses at a clonal level.

1,Recent Advances on Detection and Characterization of Fruit Tree Viruses Using High-Throughput Sequencing Technologies.,"Perennial crops, such as fruit trees, are infected by many viruses, which are transmitted through vegetative propagation and grafting of infected plant material. Some of these pathogens cause severe crop losses and often reduce the productive life of the orchards. Detection and characterization of these agents in fruit trees is challenging, however, during the last years, the wide application of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has significantly facilitated this task. In this review, we present recent advances in the discovery, detection, and characterization of fruit tree viruses and virus-like agents accomplished by HTS approaches. A high number of new viruses have been described in the last 5 years, some of them exhibiting novel genomic features that have led to the proposal of the creation of new genera, and the revision of the current virus taxonomy status. Interestingly, several of the newly identified viruses belong to virus genera previously unknown to infect fruit tree species (e.g., <i>Fabavirus</i>, <i>Luteovirus</i>) a fact that challenges our perspective of plant viruses in general. Finally, applied methodologies, including the use of different molecules as templates, as well as advantages and disadvantages and future directions of HTS in fruit tree virology are discussed."
1,Antiviral Activity of Porcine Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 against Swine Viruses in Cell Culture.,"Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), as an important transcription factor, is abundantly induced upon virus infections and participates in host antiviral immune responses. However, the roles of porcine IRF1 (poIRF1) in host antiviral defense remain poorly understood. In this study, we determined that poIRF1 was upregulated upon infection with viruses and distributed in nucleus in porcine PK-15 cells. Subsequently, we tested the antiviral activities of poIRF1 against several swine viruses in cells. Overexpression of poIRF1 can efficiently suppress the replication of viruses, and knockdown of poIRF1 promotes moderately viral replication. Interestingly, overexpression of poIRF1 enhances dsRNA-induced IFN-?? and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activation, whereas knockdown of poIRF1 cannot significantly affect the activation of IFN-?? promoter induced by RNA viruses. This study suggests that poIRF1 plays a significant role in cellular antiviral response against swine viruses, but might be dispensable for IFN-?? induction triggered by RNA viruses in PK-15 cells. Given these results, poIRF1 plays potential roles in cellular antiviral responses against swine viruses. "
1,Structural studies of <i>Acidianus</i> tailed spindle virus reveal a structural paradigm used in the assembly of spindle-shaped viruses.,"The spindle-shaped virion morphology is common among archaeal viruses, where it is a defining characteristic of many viral families. However, structural heterogeneity intrinsic to spindle-shaped viruses has seriously hindered efforts to elucidate the molecular architecture of these lemon-shaped capsids. We have utilized a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography to study <i>Acidianus</i> tailed spindle virus (ATSV). These studies reveal the architectural principles that underlie assembly of a spindle-shaped virus. Cryo-electron tomography shows a smooth transition from the spindle-shaped capsid into the tubular-shaped tail and allows low-resolution structural modeling of individual virions. Remarkably, higher-dose 2D micrographs reveal a helical surface lattice in the spindle-shaped capsid. Consistent with this, crystallographic studies of the major capsid protein reveal a decorated four-helix bundle that packs within the crystal to form a four-start helical assembly with structural similarity to the tube-shaped tail structure of ATSV and other tailed, spindle-shaped viruses. Combined, this suggests that the spindle-shaped morphology of the ATSV capsid is formed by a multistart helical assembly with a smoothly varying radius and allows construction of a pseudoatomic model for the lemon-shaped capsid that extends into a tubular tail. The potential advantages that this novel architecture conveys to the life cycle of spindle-shaped viruses, including a role in DNA ejection, are discussed."
1,"Detection of Usutu, Sindbis, and Batai Viruses in Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) Collected in Germany, 2011???2016.","Due to the emergence of non-endemic mosquito vectors and the recent outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases, mosquito-borne pathogens are considered an increasing risk to public and animal health in Europe. To obtain a status quo regarding mosquito-borne viruses and their vectors in Germany, 97,648 mosquitoes collected from 2011 to 2016 throughout the country were screened for arboviruses. Mosquitoes were identified to species, pooled in groups of up to 50 individuals according to sampling location and date, and screened with different PCR assays for <i>Flavi-</i>, <i>Alpha-</i> and <i>Orthobunyavirus</i> RNA. Two pools tested positive for Usutu virus-RNA, two for Sindbis virus-RNA, and 24 for Batai virus-RNA. The pools consisted of <i>Culex pipiens</i> s.l., <i>Culex modestus</i>, <i>Culex torrentium</i>, <i>Culiseta</i> sp., <i>Aedes vexans</i>, <i>Anopheles daciae</i>, and <i>Anopheles messeae</i> mosquitoes and could be assigned to nine different collection sites, with seven of them located in northeastern Germany. Phylogenetic analyses of the viral RNA sequences showed relationships with strains of the viruses previously demonstrated in Germany. These findings confirm continuing mosquito-borne zoonotic arbovirus circulation even though only a rather small percentage of the screened samples tested positive. With respect to sampling sites and periods, virus circulation seems to be particularly intense in floodplains and after flooding events when mosquitoes develop in excessive numbers and where they have numerous avian hosts available to feed on."
1,"Comparative analysis of chrysanthemum transcriptome in response to three RNA viruses: Cucumber mosaic virus, Tomato spotted wilt virus and Potato virus X.","The chrysanthemum is one of popular flowers in the world and a host for several viruses. So far, molecular interaction studies between the chrysanthemum and viruses are limited. In this study, we carried out a transcriptome analysis of chrysanthemum in response to three different viruses including Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and Potato virus X (PVX). A chrysanthemum 135K microarray derived from expressed sequence tags was successfully applied for the expression profiles of the chrysanthemum at early stage of virus infection. Finally, we identified a total of 125, 70 and 124 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for CMV, TSWV and PVX, respectively. Many DEGs were virus specific; however, 33 DEGs were commonly regulated by three viruses. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified a total of 132 GO terms, and of them, six GO terms related stress response and MCM complex were commonly identified for three viruses. Several genes functioning in stress response such as chitin response and ethylene mediated signaling pathway were up-regulated indicating their involvement in establishment of host immune system. In particular, TSWV infection significantly down-regulated genes related to DNA metabolic process including DNA replication, chromatin organization, histone modification and cytokinesis, and they are mostly targeted to nucleosome and MCM complex. Taken together, our comparative transcriptome analysis revealed several genes related to hormone mediated viral stress response and DNA modification. The identified chrysanthemums genes could be good candidates for further functional study associated with resistant to various plant viruses. "
1,Functional Evolution of Influenza Virus NS1 Protein in Currently Circulating Human 2009 Pandemic H1N1 Viruses.,"In 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza virus emerged in humans, causing a global pandemic. It was previously shown that the NS1 protein from this human 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus was an effective interferon (IFN) antagonist but could not inhibit general host gene expression, unlike other NS1 proteins from seasonal human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Here we show that the NS1 protein from currently circulating pH1N1 viruses has evolved to encode 6 amino acid changes (E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S) with respect to the original protein. Notably, these 6 residue changes restore the ability of pH1N1 NS1 to inhibit general host gene expression, mainly by their ability to restore binding to the cellular factor CPSF30. This is the first report describing the ability of the pH1N1 NS1 protein to naturally acquire mutations that restore this function. Importantly, a recombinant pH1N1 virus containing these 6 amino acid changes in the NS1 protein (pH1N1/NSs-6mut) inhibited host IFN and proinflammatory responses to a greater extent than that with the parental virus (pH1N1/NS1-wt), yet virus titers were not significantly increased in cell cultures or in mouse lungs, and the disease was partially attenuated. The pH1N1/NSs-6mut virus grew similarly to pH1N1/NSs-wt in mouse lungs, but infection with pH1N1/NSs-6mut induced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, likely due to a general inhibition of gene expression mediated by the mutated NS1 protein. This lower level of inflammation induced by the pH1N1/NSs-6mut virus likely accounts for the attenuated disease phenotype and may represent a host-virus adaptation affecting influenza virus pathogenesis.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs) are among the most common causes of respiratory infections in humans. In addition, occasional pandemics are caused when IAVs circulating in other species emerge in the human population. In 2009, a swine-origin H1N1 IAV (pH1N1) was transmitted to humans, infecting people then and up to the present. It was previously shown that the NS1 protein from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus is not able to inhibit general gene expression. However, currently circulating pH1N1 viruses have evolved to encode 6 amino acid changes (E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S) that allow the NS1 protein of contemporary pH1N1 strains to inhibit host gene expression, which correlates with its ability to interact with CPSF30. Infection with a recombinant pH1N1 virus encoding these 6 amino acid changes (pH1N1/NSs-6mut) induced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in viral attenuation <i>in vivo</i> This might represent an adaptation of pH1N1 virus to humans."
1,A multiplex PCR for detection of six viruses in ducks.,"In this study, six pairs of specific primers that can amplify DNA fragments of different sizes were designed and synthesized according to viral protein gene sequences published in GenBank. Then, a multiplex PCR method was established for rapid detection of duck hepatitis virus 1, duck plague virus, duck Tembusu virus, muscovy duck parvovirus, muscovy duck reovirus, and duck H9N2 avian influenza virus, and achieve simple and rapid detection of viral diseases in ducks. Single PCR was used to confirm primer specificity, and PCR conditions were optimized to construct a multiplex PCR system. Specificity and sensitivity assays were also developed. The multiplex PCR was used to detect duck embryos infected with mixed viruses and those with clinically suspected diseases to verify the feasibility of the multiplex PCR. Results show that the primers can specifically amplify target fragments, without any cross-amplification with other viruses. The multiplex PCR system can amplify six DNA fragments from the pooled viral genomes and specifically detect nucleic acids of the six duck susceptible viruses when the template amount is 10<sup>2</sup> copies/??l. In addition, the system can be used to detect viral nucleic acids in duck embryos infected with the six common viruses. The detection results for clinical samples are consistent with those detected by single PCR. Therefore, the established multiplex PCR method can perform specific, sensitive, and high-throughput detection of six duck-infecting viruses and can be applied to clinical identification and diagnosis of viral infection in ducks."
1,"Experimental Zika virus infection in <i>Aedes aegypti</i>: Susceptibility, transmission & co-infection with dengue & chikungunya viruses.","There are reports about the susceptibility of Aedes mosquitoes to ZIKV from various countries, however, no such information is available from Indian sub-continent, although, high level of group cross-reactivity of ZIKV with other flaviviruses has been reported. During outbreak situations, many cases of Dengue (DEN) and Chikungunya (CHIK) are reported. In such scenario, vector mosquitoes are likely to get co-infection/secondary-infection with one or other virus. The present study was carried out to determine the susceptibility of Indian strain of Aedes aegypti to Zika virus (ZIKV) strain (MR-766) and the effect of co-infection/super-infection with either dengue virus (serotype-2) (DENV) or chikungunya virus (CHIKV) on ZIKV replication.Ae. aegypti mosquitoes used in this study were reared for many generations since 1980 at laboratory colony maintained at the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, India. Transmissibility of ZIKV from infected mosquitoes to suckling mice was also studied. Mosquitoes were experimentally infected with ZIKV and super-infected with either DENV or CHIKV via membrane-feeding route and incubated for 14 days at 28??2??C and humidity of 85??5 per cent. Replication of these viruses in mosquitoes was confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence assay. Twenty infected mosquitoes were allowed to feed upon four suckling CD1 mice for about 30 min. Transmission of the ZIKV by infected mosquitoes to suckling mice was confirmed by the appearance of clinical signs and the presence of viral RNA in different organs.Concomitant infection of mosquitoes with all the three viruses showed simultaneous propagation of all three viruses, confirmed by real time RT-PCR and IFA. Infection of mosquitoes with CHIKV followed by ZIKV showed positivity in individual head squashes (7%) for both viruses using IFA; only 8.3 per cent showed dual positivity with primary infection of ZIKV followed by DENV; 8.3 per cent dual infection positivity was observed when infected with DENV followed by ZIKV; 5 per cent showed dual infection was observed when infected with ZIKV followed by CHIKV. Ae. aegypti was found to be susceptible to ZIKV strain as ZIKV could be detected from the second post-infection day (PID) in infected mosquitoes. Transmission of ZIKV to mice by the bite of infected Ae. aegypti establishes this species as a potential vector.From super-infection experiments, it was concluded that ZIKV might have a relative advantage in replication dynamics over DENV. Vertical transmission was not observed for ZIKV in experimentally infected mosquitoes (n=920 larvae). Further studies are required to understand the possibility of silently circulating ZIKV in India, which remain non-detected because of lack of surveillance."
1,"Waterborne Viruses and F-Specific Coliphages in Mixed-Use Watersheds: Microbial Associations, Host Specificities, and Affinities with Environmental/Land Use Factors.","From the years 2008 to 2014, a total of 1,155 water samples were collected (spring to fall) from 24 surface water sampling sites located in a mixed-used but predominantly agricultural (i.e., dairy livestock production) river basin in eastern Ontario, Canada. Water was analyzed for viable F-specific DNA (F-DNA) and F-specific RNA (F-RNA) (genogroup I [GI] to GIV) coliphage and a suite of molecularly detected viruses (norovirus [GI to GIV], torque teno virus [TTV], rotavirus, kobuvirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, hepatitis A, and hepatitis E). F-DNA and F-RNA coliphage were detected in 33 and 28% of the samples at maximum concentrations of 2,000 and 16,300 PFU ?? 100 ml<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Animal TTV, human TTV, kobuvirus, astrovirus, and norovirus GIII were the most prevalent viruses, found in 23, 20, 13, 12, and 11% of samples, respectively. Viable F-DNA coliphage was found to be a modest positive indicator of molecularly detected TTV. F-RNA coliphage, unlike F-DNA coliphage, was a modest positive predictor of norovirus and rotavirus. There were, however, a number of significant negative associations among F-specific coliphage and viruses. F-DNA coliphage densities of >142 PFU ?? 100 ml<sup>-1</sup> delineated conditions when ???95% of water samples contained some type of virus. Kobuvirus was the virus most strongly related to detection of any other virus. Land use had some associations with virus/F-specific coliphage detection, but season and surface water flow were the variables that were most important for broadly delineating detection. Higher relative levels of detection of human viruses and human F-RNA coliphage were associated with higher relative degrees of upstream human land development in a catchment.This study is one of the first, to our knowledge, to evaluate relationships among F-specific coliphages and a large suite of enteric viruses in mixed-use but agriculturally dominated surface waters in Canada. This study suggested that relationships between viable F-specific coliphages and molecularly detected viruses do exist, but they are not always positive. Caution should be employed if viable F-specific coliphages are to be used as indicators of virus presence in surface waters. This study elucidates relative effects of agriculture, wildlife, and human activity on virus and F-specific coliphage detection. Seasonal and meteorological attributes play a strong role in the detection of most virus and F-specific coliphage targets."
1,Enteric Viruses in Surface Waters from Argentina: Molecular and Viable-Virus Detection.,"Water resources contaminated with wastewater are an important source for the dissemination of enteric viruses with an impact on the health of the population. The aim of the study was to assess the viral contamination of freshwater from a dam in Argentina by using infectious enterovirus detection, viral RNA amplification, and a genetic characterization of five enteric viruses associated with diarrhea and hepatitis. Enterovirus infectivity (iEV) was evaluated by cell culture and direct immunofluorescence. The detection of the viral genome of rotavirus (RV), human astrovirus (HAstV), norovirus (NoV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV) was performed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). A total of 48 water samples from 4 monitoring points on the body of the dam from January to December 2012 and 66 water samples from 3 tourist beaches on the edge of the dam from October 2013 to October 2015 were collected monthly. During the first period, the overall viral frequency detection was 52.1% for group A RV, 50% for HAstV, 60.4% for NoV, 22.9% for HAV, 2.1% for HEV, and 64.6% for iEV. The overall frequency detection for the second sampling was 18.2% for RV and HAstV, 31.8% for NoV, 7.57% for HEV, and 66.7% for iEV. There was no detection of HAV during this period. The genotypes and genogroups detected through the study correlated with the most common genomic variants associated with human gastrointestinal and hepatitis illnesses. The results obtained could alert the health systems and environmental sanitation to make decisions for viral control and prevention in our environment.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The study shows the impact of anthropic contamination of one of the most important tourist water resources in Argentina. This course of recreational water would be a favorable scenario for infection, as well as a reservoir for the enteric viruses, creating a risk for the population exposed to these waters. The results obtained could alert the health systems and environmental sanitation to make decisions for the control and prevention of viral diseases in this environment."
1,Fecal Respiratory Viruses in Acute Viral Respiratory Infection and Nasopharyngeal Diarrheal Viruses in Acute Viral Gastroenteritis: Clinical Impact of Ectopic Viruses Is Questionable.,"Our aim was to determine the detection rate of respiratory viruses (RVs) in feces of patients with acute viral respiratory infection (AVRI) and the detection rate of diarrheal viruses (DVs) in nasopharyngeal samples from patients with acute viral gastroenteritis. The relationships between the presence of fecal RVs or nasopharyngeal DVs and their impacts on the clinical severity were also investigated. A total of 144 fecal specimens were collected from AVRI patients and 95 nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from acute viral gastroenteritis patients. Clinical characteristics and laboratory profiles were compared between subgroups on the basis of the presence or absence of virus in the specimens. The detection rate of RVs in feces was 17.4% (25/144), whereas the detection rate for viruses identical to the respiratory pathogen was 10.4% (identical group, 15/144). Within the identical group, adenovirus (86.7%, 13/15) was most commonly found. Patients in the identical group showed statistically higher values for C-reactive protein, mean age, increased frequency of vomiting, and decreased frequency of chest film involvement and cough (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The detection rate of nasopharyngeal DVs among acute viral gastroenteritis patients was 19.0% (18/95), and in the identical group it was 15.8% (15/95). Norovirus group II and enteric adenovirus were the major pathogens detected in the identical group. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics and laboratory profiles between the subgroups. In conclusion, the major pathogens of fecal RV and nasopharyngeal DV were adenovirus and norovirus group II, respectively. However, their relationship with the clinical symptoms or disease severity is unclear."
1,"Mixed Infections of Four Viruses, the Incidence and Phylogenetic Relationships of Sweet Potato Chlorotic Fleck Virus (Betaflexiviridae) Isolates in Wild Species and Sweetpotatoes in Uganda and Evidence of Distinct Isolates in East Africa.","Viruses infecting wild flora may have a significant negative impact on nearby crops, and vice-versa. Only limited information is available on wild species able to host economically important viruses that infect sweetpotatoes (Ipomoea batatas). In this study, Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV; Carlavirus, Betaflexiviridae) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV; Crinivirus, Closteroviridae) were surveyed in wild plants of family Convolvulaceae (genera Astripomoea, Ipomoea, Hewittia and Lepistemon) in Uganda. Plants belonging to 26 wild species, including annuals, biannuals and perennials from four agro-ecological zones, were observed for virus-like symptoms in 2004 and 2007 and sampled for virus testing. SPCFV was detected in 84 (2.9%) of 2864 plants tested from 17 species. SPCSV was detected in 66 (5.4%) of the 1224 plants from 12 species sampled in 2007. Some SPCSV-infected plants were also infected with Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV; Potyvirus, Potyviridae; 1.3%), Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV; Ipomovirus, Potyviridae; 0.5%) or both (0.4%), but none of these three viruses were detected in SPCFV-infected plants. Co-infection of SPFMV with SPMMV was detected in 1.2% of plants sampled. Virus-like symptoms were observed in 367 wild plants (12.8%), of which 42 plants (11.4%) were negative for the viruses tested. Almost all (92.4%) the 419 sweetpotato plants sampled from fields close to the tested wild plants displayed virus-like symptoms, and 87.1% were infected with one or more of the four viruses. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of the 3'-proximal genomic region of SPCFV, including the silencing suppressor (NaBP)- and coat protein (CP)-coding regions implicated strong purifying selection on the CP and NaBP, and that the SPCFV strains from East Africa are distinguishable from those from other continents. However, the strains from wild species and sweetpotato were indistinguishable, suggesting reciprocal movement of SPCFV between wild and cultivated Convolvulaceae plants in the field."
1,Generation of influenza A viruses as live but replication-incompetent virus vaccines.,"The conversion of life-threatening viruses into live but avirulent vaccines represents a revolution in vaccinology. In a proof-of-principle study, we expanded the genetic code of the genome of influenza A virus via a transgenic cell line containing orthogonal translation machinery. This generated premature termination codon (PTC)-harboring viruses that exerted full infectivity but were replication-incompetent in conventional cells. Genome-wide optimization of the sites for incorporation of multiple PTCs resulted in highly reproductive and genetically stable progeny viruses in transgenic cells. In mouse, ferret, and guinea pig models, vaccination with PTC viruses elicited robust humoral, mucosal, and T cell-mediated immunity against antigenically distinct influenza viruses and even neutralized existing infecting strains. The methods presented here may become a general approach for generating live virus vaccines that can be adapted to almost any virus."
1,"Viruses, Artificial Viruses and Virus-Based Structures for Biomedical Applications.","Nanobiomaterials such as virus particles and artificial virus particles offer tremendous opportunities to develop new biomedical applications such as drug- or gene-delivery, imaging and sensing but also improve understanding of biological mechanisms. Recent advances within the field of virus-based systems give insights in how to mimic viral structures and virus assembly processes as well as understanding biodistribution, cell/tissue targeting, controlled and triggered disassembly or release and circulation times. All these factors are of high importance for virus-based functional systems. This review illustrates advances in mimicking and enhancing or controlling these aspects to a high degree toward delivery and imaging applications."
1,Reassortant H5N1 avian influenza viruses containing PA or NP gene from an H9N2 virus significantly increase the pathogenicity in mice.,"Reassortment between different influenza viruses is a crucial way to generate novel influenza viruses with unpredictable virulence and transmissibility, which may threaten the public health. As currently in China, avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of H9N2 and H5N1 subtypes are endemic in poultry in many areas, while they are prone to reassort with each other naturally. In order to evaluate the risk of the reassortment to public health, A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403/2010 [GS/10(H5N1)] virus was used as a backbone to generate a series of reassortants, each contained a single internal gene derived from the predominant S genotype of the A/Chicken/Jiangsu/WJ57/2012 [WJ/57(H9N2)]. We next assessed the biological characteristics of these assortments, including pathogenicity, replication efficiency and polymerase activity. We found that the parental WJ/57(H9N2) and GS/10(H5N1) viruses displayed high genetic compatibility. Notably, the H5N1 reassortants containing the PA or NP gene from WJ/57(H9N2) virus significantly increased virulence and replication ability in mice, as well as markedly enhanced polymerase activity. Our results indicate that the endemicity of H9N2 and H5N1 in domestic poultry greatly increases the possibility of generating new viruses by reassortment that may pose a great threat to poultry industry and public health.

1,Multiple oncogenic viruses are present in human breast tissues before development of virus associated breast cancer.,"Multiple oncogenic viruses including, mouse mammary tumor virus, bovine leukemia virus, human papilloma virus, and Epstein Barr virus, have been identified as separate infectious pathogens in human breast cancer. Here we demonstrate that these four viruses may be present in normal and benign breast tissues 1 to 11??years before the development of same virus breast cancer in the same patients.We combined the data we developed during investigations of the individual four oncogenic viruses and breast cancer. Patients who had benign breast biopsies 1-11??years prior to developing breast cancer were identified by pathology reports from a large Australian pathology service (Douglas Hanly Moir Pathology). Archival formalin fixed specimens from these patients were collected. The same archival specimens were used for (i) investigations of mouse mammary tumour virus (also known as human mammary tumour virus) conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York and at the University of Pisa, Italy, (ii) bovine leukemia virus conducted at the University of California at Berkeley,(iii) human papilloma virus and Epstein Barr virus conducted at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. Seventeen normal breast tissues from cosmetic breast surgery conducted on Australian patients were used as controls. These patients were younger than those with benign and later breast cancer.Standard and in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were used to identify the four viruses. The detailed methods are outlined in the separate publications.: mouse mammary tumor virus, human papilloma virus and Epstein Barr virus (Infect Agent Cancer 12:1, 2017, PLoS One 12:e0179367, 2017, Front Oncol 5:277, 2015, PLoS One 7:e48788, 2012). Epstein Barr virus and human papilloma virus were identified in the same breast cancer cells by in situ PCR. Mouse mammary tumour virus was identified in 6 (24%) of 25 benign breast specimens and in 9 (36%) of 25 breast cancer specimens which subsequently developed in the same patients. Bovine leukemia virus was identified in 18 (78%) of 23 benign breast specimens and in 20 (91%) of 22 subsequent breast cancers in the same patients. High risk human papilloma viruses were identified in 13 (72%) of 17 benign breast specimens and in 13 (76%) of 17 subsequent breast cancers in the same patients. Epstein Barr virus was not identified in any benign breast specimens but was identified in 3 (25%) of 12 subsequent breast cancers in the same patients. Mouse mammary tumour virus 3 (18%), bovine leukemia virus 6 (35%), high risk human papilloma virus 3 (18%) and Epstein Barr virus 5 (29%) were identified in 17 normal control breast specimens.These findings add to the evidence that multiple oncogenic viruses have potential roles in human breast cancer. This is an important observation because evidence of prior infection before the development of disease is a key criterion when assessing causation."
1,Comparative Genomics of Chrysochromulina Ericina Virus and Other Microalga-Infecting Large DNA Viruses Highlights Their Intricate Evolutionary Relationship with the Established Mimiviridae Family.,"Chrysochromulina ericina virus CeV-01B (CeV) was isolated from Norwegian coastal waters in 1998. Its icosahedral particle is 160 nm in diameter and encloses a 474-kb double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. This virus, although infecting a microalga (the haptophyceae <i>Haptolina ericina</i>, formerly <i>Chrysochromulina ericina</i>), is phylogenetically related to members of the <i>Mimiviridae</i> family, initially established with the acanthamoeba-infecting mimivirus and megavirus as prototypes. This family was later split into two genera (<i>Mimivirus</i> and <i>Cafeteriavirus</i>) following the characterization of a virus infecting the heterotrophic stramenopile <i>Cafeteria roenbergensis</i> (CroV). CeV, as well as two of its close relatives, which infect the unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes <i>Phaeocystis globosa</i> (Phaeocystis globosa virus [PgV]) and <i>Aureococcus anophagefferens</i> (Aureococcus anophagefferens virus [AaV]), are currently unclassified by the International Committee on Viral Taxonomy (ICTV). The detailed comparative analysis of the CeV genome presented here confirms the phylogenetic affinity of this emerging group of microalga-infecting viruses with the <i>Mimiviridae</i> but argues in favor of their classification inside a distinct clade within the family. Although CeV, PgV, and AaV share more common features among them than with the larger <i>Mimiviridae</i>, they also exhibit a large complement of unique genes, attesting to their complex evolutionary history. We identified several gene fusion events and cases of convergent evolution involving independent lateral gene acquisitions. Finally, CeV possesses an unusual number of inteins, some of which are closely related despite being inserted in nonhomologous genes. This appears to contradict the paradigm of allele-specific inteins and suggests that the <i>Mimiviridae</i> are especially efficient in spreading inteins while enlarging their repertoire of homing genes.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Although it infects the microalga <i>Chrysochromulina ericina</i>, CeV is more closely related to acanthamoeba-infecting viruses of the <i>Mimiviridae</i> family than to any member of the <i>Phycodnaviridae</i>, the ICTV-approved family historically including all alga-infecting large dsDNA viruses. CeV, as well as its relatives that infect the microalgae <i>Phaeocystic globosa</i> (PgV) and <i>Aureococcus anophagefferens</i> (AaV), remains officially unclassified and a source of confusion in the literature. Our comparative analysis of the CeV genome in the context of this emerging group of alga-infecting viruses suggests that they belong to a distinct clade within the established <i>Mimiviridae</i> family. The presence of a large number of unique genes as well as specific gene fusion events, evolutionary convergences, and inteins integrated at unusual locations document the complex evolutionary history of the CeV lineage."
1,"The temperature-sensitive and attenuation phenotypes conferred by mutations in the influenza virus PB2, PB1, and NP genes are influenced by the species of origin of the PB2 gene in reassortant viruses derived from influenza A/California/07/2009 and A/WSN/33 viruses.","Live attenuated influenza vaccines in the United States are derived from a human virus that is temperature sensitive (ts), characterized by restricted (??? 100-fold) replication at 39 ??C. The ts genetic signature (ts sig) has been mapped to 5 loci in 3 genes: PB1 (391 E, 581 G, and 661 T), PB2 (265 S), and NP (34 G). However, when transferred into avian and swine influenza viruses, only partial ts and attenuation phenotypes occur. To investigate the reason for this, we introduced the ts sig into the human origin virus A/WSN/33 (WSN), the avian-origin virus A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN04), and the swine origin triple-reassortant 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus A/California/07/2009 (CA07), which contains gene segments from human, avian, and swine viruses. The VN04(ts sig) and CA07(ts sig) viruses replicated efficiently in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at 39 ??C, but the replication of WSN(ts sig) was restricted ??? 100-fold compared to that at 33 ??C. Reassortant CA07(ts sig) viruses were generated with individual polymerase gene segments from WSN, and vice versa. Only ts sig viruses with a PB2 gene segment derived from WSN were restricted in replication ??? 100-fold at 39 ??C. In ferrets, the CA07(ts sig) virus replicated in the upper and lower respiratory tract, but the replication of a reassortant CA07(ts sig) virus with a WSN PB2 gene was severely restricted in the lungs. Taken together, these data suggest that the origin of the PB2 gene segment influences the ts phenotype in vitro and attenuation in vivo. This could have implications for the design of novel live vaccines against animal origin influenza viruses.Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) on temperature-sensitive (ts) backbones derived from animal origin influenza viruses are being sought for use in the poultry and swine industries and to protect people against animal origin influenza. However, inserting the ts genetic signature from a licensed LAIV backbone fails to fully attenuate these viruses. Our data indicate this is associated with the presence of a PB2 gene segment derived from an avian influenza virus. We show that a reassortant 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus with the ts signature from a licensed LAIV donor virus is ts in vitro and attenuated in vivo when the PB2 gene is derived from a human origin virus but not from an avian virus. Our study provides information that could benefit the rational design of alternative LAIV backbones against animal origin influenza viruses."
1,Genomic reassortants of pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 virus and endemic porcine H1 and H3 viruses in swine in Japan.,"From 2010 to 2013 in Japan, we isolated 11 swine influenza viruses (SIVs) from pigs showing respiratory symptoms. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that 6 H1N1 viruses originated from the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pdm 09) virus and the other 5 viruses were reassortants between SIVs and pdm 09 viruses, representing 4 genotypes. Two H1N2 viruses contained H1 and N2 genes originated from Japanese H1N2 SIV together with internal genes of pdm 09 viruses. Additionally, 1 H1N2 virus contained a further NP gene originating from Japanese H1N2 SIV. One H1N1 virus contained only the H1 gene originating from Japanese H1 SIV in a pdm 09 virus background. One H3N2 virus contained H3 and N2 genes originating from Japanese H3N2 SIV together with internal genes of pdm 09 virus. The results indicate that pdm 09 viruses are distributed widely in the Japanese swine population and that several reassortments with Japanese SIVs have occurred. "
1,Epidemic Spread of Usutu Virus in Southwest Germany in 2011 to 2013 and Monitoring of Wild Birds for Usutu and West Nile Viruses.,"Mosquito-borne viruses are becoming an increasing threat for Europe. One of these viruses is Usutu virus (USUV), a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis virus group within the family Flaviviridae. Since the occurrence of USUV among wild birds in June, 2011, infected Blackbirds (Turdus merula) have frequently been found dead in southwest Germany, cumulating in a massive die-off. Moreover, other bird species (Strigiformes) in this region have been affected. In a first study, 209 of over 600 dead birds (wild birds and birds kept in aviaries) collected from 2011 to 2013 carried USUV, more than 88% of them Blackbirds. USUV had already been detected in 2010, one year before the epizooty, in a mosquito-based surveillance program in Germany. The main epidemic area of the USUV outbreak in wild birds in southwest Germany has been similar for the last three years. In a second study during 2011 to 2013, 902 live migratory and resident birds (representing 87 bird species belonging to 14 bird orders) from four different sampling sites were bled and tested serologically and by qPCR for West Nile virus (WNV) and USUV infections. No USUV or WNV genomes were detected. Some migratory birds (mainly long-distance migrants and some partial migrants) carried neutralizing antibodies against WNV as discriminated by USUV and WNV cross-neutralization tests. Only few resident birds showed relevant USUV-specific neutralizing antibodies. The occurrence of USUV in the Upper Rhine valley area of southwest Germany is a proof of principle for the incursion and spread of other arthropod-borne (arbo)-viruses along these routes. Therefore, monitoring studies in birds and mosquitoes for the presence of arboviruses in these areas are indispensable. "
1,[Simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses and influenza A virus subtypes using multiplex PCR].,"This study was conducted to investigate the respiratory viruses and subtyping of influenza A virus when positive by multiplex PCR in patients with flu-like symptoms, after the pandemic caused by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. Nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 700 patients (313 female, 387 male; age range: 24 days-94 yrs, median age: 1 yr) between December 2010 - January 2013 with flu-like symptoms including fever, headache, sore throat, rhinitis, cough, myalgia as defined by the World Health Organization were included in the study. Nucleic acid extractions (Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit, iNtRON, South Korea) and cDNA synthesis (RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kits, Fermentas, USA) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Multiplex amplification of nucleic acids was performed using DPO (dual priming oligonucleotide) primers and RV5 ACE Screening Kit (Seegene, South Korea) in terms of the presence of influenza A (INF-A) virus, influenza B (INF-B) virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the other respiratory viruses. PCR products were detected by automated polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Screen Tape multiple detection system. Specimens which were positive for viral nucleic acids have been further studied by using specific DPO primers, FluA ACE Subtyping and RV15 Screening (Seegene, South Korea) kits. Four INF-A virus subtypes [human H1 (hH1), human H3 (hH3), swine H1 (sH1), avian H5 (aH5)] and 11 other respiratory viruses [Adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1-4, human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus types A and B, human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, 229E/NL63] were investigated with those tests. In the study, 53.6% (375/700) of the patients were found to be infected with at least one virus and multiple respiratory virus infections were detected in 15.7% (59/375) of the positive cases, which were mostly (49/59, 83%) in pediatric patients. RSV and rhinovirus coinfections were the most prevalent (18/29, 62.7%) dual infections. The distribution of 436 respiratory viruses identified from 375 patients were as follows; 189 (43.3%) RSV, 93 (21.4%) rhinovirus, 86 (19.8%) INF-A, seven (1.6%) INF-B, 22 (5%) PIV types 1-3, 14 (3.2%) HMPV, 11 (2.5%) HCoV, nine (2%) HBoV, and five (1.2%) adenovirus. Fifty-five (64%) out of 86 INF-A viruses were subtyped as hH3, 24 (27.9%) were sH1 and seven (8.1%) were hH1. Avian H5 was not detected in any samples. The overall prevalence rates of INF-A, INF-B, RSV and other respiratory viruses were 12%, 1%, 27%, and 14.6%, respectively. RSV was the most prevalent respiratory agent in pediatric (161/313, 51%) cases, while INF-A virus in adult (24/62, 38.7%) patients. Influenza viruses were detected as responsible pathogens in 13.3% (93/700) of the patients with flu-like symptoms. Among the cases, a 1-month-old baby was infected with three virus strains (INF-A hH1+INF-A sH1+HCoV OC43) and a 82-year-old patient was infected with two INF-A virus subtypes (hH3 + sH1). INF-A viruses were mostly detected (79/86) in winter period, from December to March. INF-A virus sH1, was the most prevalent subtype in flu cases till February 2011 (22/86), after replaced by INF-A virus hH3. Beginning from February 2012, a significant increase observed in the cases infected with INF-A virus subtype hH3 (39/86). In conclusion, the identification and surveillance of influenza virus types and subtypes circulating in populations have importance both for epidemiological data and selection of vaccine strains. "
1,"Viruses of parasites as actors in the parasite-host relationship: A ""m??nage ?? trois"".","The complex parasite-host relationship involves multiple mechanisms. Moreover, parasites infected by viruses modify this relationship adding more complexity to the system that now comprises three partners. Viruses infecting parasites were described several decades ago. However, until recently little was known about the viruses involved and their impact on the resulting disease caused to the hosts. To clarify this situation, we have concentrated on parasitic diseases caused to humans and on how virus-infected parasites could alter the symptoms inflicted on the human host. It is clear that the effect caused to the human host depends on the virus and on the parasite it has infected. Consequently, the review is divided as follows: Viruses with a possible effect on the virulence of the parasite. This section reviews pertinent articles showing that infection of parasites by viruses might increase the detrimental effect of the tandem virus-parasite on the human host (hypervirulence) or decrease virulence of the parasite (hypovirulence). Parasites as vectors affecting the transmission of viruses. In some cases, the virus-infected parasite might facilitate the transfer of the virus to the human host. Parasites harboring viruses with unidentified effects on their host. In spite of recently renewed interest in parasites in connection with their viruses, there still remains a number of cases in which the effect of the virus of a given parasite on the human host remains ambiguous. The triangular relationship between the virus, the parasite and the host, and the modulation of the pathogenicity and virulence of the parasites by viruses should be taken into account in the rationale of fighting against parasites."
1,Effects of simultaneously elevated temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> levels on Nicotiana benthamiana and its infection by different positive-sense RNA viruses are cumulative and virus type-specific.,"We have studied how simultaneously elevated temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> levels [climate change-related conditions (CCC) of 30??C, 970 parts-per-million (ppm) of CO<sub>2</sub> vs. standard conditions (SC) of 25??C, ~ 405ppm CO<sub>2</sub>] affect physiochemical properties of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, and also its infection by several positive-sense RNA viruses. In previous works we had studied effects of elevated temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> levels separately. Under CCC, leaves of healthy plants almost doubled their area relative to SC but contained less protein/unit-of-area, similarly to what we had found under conditions of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> alone. CCC also affected the sizes/numbers of different foliar cell types differently. Under CCC, infection outcomes in titers and symptoms were virus type-specific, broadly similar to those observed under elevated temperature alone. Under either condition, infections did not significantly alter the protein content of leaf discs. Therefore, effects of elevated temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> combined on properties of the pathosystems studied were overall cumulative."
1,Inactivation of Viruses and Bacteriophages as Models for Swine Hepatitis E Virus in Food Matrices.,"Hepatitis E virus has been recognised as a food-borne virus hazard in pork products, due to its zoonotic properties. This risk can be reduced by adequate treatment of the food to inactivate food-borne viruses. We used a spectrum of viruses and bacteriophages to evaluate the effect of three food treatments: high pressure processing (HPP), lactic acid (LA) and intense light pulse (ILP) treatments. On swine liver at 400??MPa for 10??min, HPP gave log<sub>10</sub> reductions of?????4.2,?????5.0 and 3.4 for feline calicivirus (FCV) 2280, FCV wildtype (wt) and murine norovirus 1 (MNV 1), respectively. Escherichia coli coliphage ??X174 displayed a lower reduction of 1.1, while Escherichia coli coliphage MS2 was unaffected. For ham at 600??MPa, the corresponding reductions were 4.1, 4.4, 2.9, 1.7 and 1.3 log<sub>10</sub>. LA treatment at 2.2??M gave log<sub>10</sub> reductions in the viral spectrum of 0.29-2.1 for swine liver and 0.87-3.1 for ham, with ??X174 and MNV 1, respectively, as the most stable microorganisms. The ILP treatment gave log<sub>10</sub> reductions of 1.6-2.8 for swine liver, 0.97-2.2 for ham and 1.3-2.3 for sausage, at 15-60??J??cm<sup>-2</sup>, with MS2 as the most stable microorganism. The HPP treatment gave significantly (p??<??0.05) greater virus reduction on swine liver than ham for the viruses at equivalent pressure/time combinations. For ILP treatment, reductions on swine liver were significantly (p??<??0.05) greater than on ham for all microorganisms. The results presented here could be used in assessments of different strategies to protect consumers against virus contamination and in advice to food producers. Conservative model indicators for the pathogenic viruses could be suggested."
1,"Characterization of Botrytis cinerea negative-stranded RNA virus 1, a new mycovirus related to plant viruses, and a reconstruction of host pattern evolution in negative-sense ssRNA viruses.","The molecular characterization of a novel negative single-stranded RNA virus infecting the plant pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea is reported here. Comparison of the sequence of Botrytis cinerea negative-stranded RNA virus 1 (BcNSRV-1) showed a strong identity with RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) of plant pathogenic emaraviruses and tospoviruses. We have also found all the molecular signatures present in the RdRp of the genus Emaravirus and in other genera of family Bunyaviridae: the conserved TPD triplet and RY dinucleotide, the three basic residues in premotif A and the conserved motifs A, B, C, D, and E. Our results showed that BcNSRV-1 is phylogenetically close to members of the genus Emaravirus and of the family Bunyaviridae, and an ancestral state reconstruction using the conserved RdRp motifs of type members of each family of (-)ssRNA viruses indicated that BcNSRV-1 could possibly derive from an invertebrate and vertebrate-infecting virus."
1,Biodiversity and full genome sequence of potato viruses Alfalfa mosaic virus and potato leaf roll virus in Egypt.,"Solanum tuberosum (potato) is the second most important vegetable crop in Egypt. It is locally consumed, manufactured or supplied for export to Europe and other Arab countries. Potato is subject to infection by a number of plant viruses, which affect its yield and quality. Potato virus Y (PVY), potato leaf roll virus (PLRV), and Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) were detected in major potato-growing areas surveyed. Multiplex-RT-PCR assay was used for the detection of these three viruses in one reaction using three specific primer pairs designed to amplify genomic parts of each virus (1594 bp for PLRV, 795 bp for AMV, 801 bp for PVY). All three viruses were detected in a single reaction mixture in naturally infected field-grown potatoes. Multiplex RT-PCR improved sensitivity necessary for the early detection of infection. Incidence of single, double, or triple infection has been recorded in some locations. Full-length sequencing has been performed for an Egyptian FER isolate of PLRV. Through phylogenetic analysis, it was shown to occupy the same clade with isolate JokerMV10 from Germany. Complete nucleotide sequence of an Egyptian FER isolate of AMV and phylogenetic analysis was also performed; we propose that it is a new distinct strain of AMV belonging to a new subgroup IIC. This is the first complete nucleotide sequence of an Egyptian isolate of AMV. Genetic biodiversity of devastating potato viruses necessitates continuous monitoring of new genetic variants of such viruses."
1,Aetiological study of viruses causing acute encephalitis syndrome in North West India.,"Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a serious public health problem, caused mainly by viruses. However, the profile of viruses causing AES in Rajasthan is not well characterised.The present study was undertaken to identify the viruses causing AES and develop diagnostic algorithm so as to help in improved diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control.The present study is a hospital-based descriptive, observational study. Samples were processed at Grade-1 DHR/ICMR Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at SMS, Jaipur.Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were processed for IgM antibody detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for mumps virus (MPV), measles virus (MV), Rubella virus (RV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue virus using commercial kits. Nucleic acid was extracted from CSF using automated extraction system. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was done using specific primers and probes for Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and enterovirus (EV).Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA.Among 3088 patients, 702 (22.7%) patients were positive for one or more viruses. HSV (261;8.45%) was the most common followed by EBV (173;5.6%), VZV (97;3.1%), CMV (68;2.2%), EV (32;1.03%), MPV (27;0.9%), DV (28;0.9%), MV (19;0.6%) and RV (6;0.2%).AES occurred sporadically in Rajasthan, samples should be tested first for herpes group of viruses followed by EV or/and for arboviruses depending on season or measles, mumps and RVs in children."
1,Phomopsis longicolla RNA virus 1 - Novel virus at the edge of myco- and plant viruses.,"The complete nucleotide sequence of a new RNA mycovirus in the KY isolate of Phomopsis longicolla Hobbs 1985 and its protoplasts subcultures p5, p9, and ME711 was discovered. The virus, provisionally named Phomopsis longicolla RNA virus 1 (PlRV1), was localized in mitochondria and was determined to have a genome 2822 nucleotides long. A single open reading frame could be translated in silico by both standard and mitochondrial genetic codes into a product featuring conservative domains for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The RdRp of PlRV1 has no counterpart among mycoviruses, but it is about 30% identical with the RdRp of plant ourmiaviruses. Recently, new mycoviruses related to plant ourmiaviruses and forming one clade with PlRV1 have been discovered. This separate clade could represent the crucial link between plant and fungal viruses."
1,Plant Virus-Insect Vector Interactions: Current and Potential Future Research Directions.,"Acquisition and transmission by an insect vector is central to the infection cycle of the majority of plant pathogenic viruses. Plant viruses can interact with their insect host in a variety of ways including both non-persistent and circulative transmission; in some cases, the latter involves virus replication in cells of the insect host. Replicating viruses can also elicit both innate and specific defense responses in the insect host. A consistent feature is that the interaction of the virus with its insect host/vector requires specific molecular interactions between virus and host, commonly via proteins. Understanding the interactions between plant viruses and their insect host can underpin approaches to protect plants from infection by interfering with virus uptake and transmission. Here, we provide a perspective focused on identifying novel approaches and research directions to facilitate control of plant viruses by better understanding and targeting virus-insect molecular interactions. We also draw parallels with molecular interactions in insect vectors of animal viruses, and consider technical advances for their control that may be more broadly applicable to plant virus vectors."
1,"Artificial ribonucleases inactivate a wide range of viruses using their ribonuclease, membranolytic, and chaotropic-like activities.","Artificial ribonucleases (aRNases) are small compounds catalysing RNA cleavage. Recently we demonstrated that aRNases readily inactivate various viruses in??vitro. Here, for three series of aRNases (1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2]octane-based and peptide-like compounds) we show that apart from ribonuclease activity the aRNases display chaotropic-like and membranolytic activities. The levels of membranolytic and chaotropic-like activities correlate well with the efficiency of various viruses inactivation (enveloped, non-enveloped, RNA-, DNA-containing). We evaluated the impact of these activities on the efficiency of virus inactivation and found: i) the synergism between membranolytic and chaotropic-like activities is sufficient for the inactivation of enveloped viruses (influenza A, encephalitis, vaccinia viruses) for 1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2]octane based aRNases, ii) the inactivation of non-enveloped viruses (encephalomyocarditis, acute bee paralysis viruses) is totally dependent on the synergism of chaotropic-like and ribonuclease activities, iii) ribonuclease activity plays a leading role in the inactivation of RNA viruses by aRNases Dp12F6, Dtr12 and K-D-1, iv) peptide-like aRNases (L2-3, K-2) being effective virus killers have a more specific mode of action. Obtained results clearly demonstrate that aRNases represent a new class of broad-spectrum virus-inactivating agents."
1,Emerging influenza viruses and the prospect of a universal influenza virus vaccine.,"Influenza viruses cause annual seasonal epidemics and pandemics at irregular intervals. Several cases of human infections with avian and swine influenza viruses have been detected recently, warranting enhanced surveillance and the development of more effective countermeasures to address the pandemic potential of these viruses. The most effective countermeasure against influenza virus infection is the use of prophylactic vaccines. However, vaccines that are currently in use for seasonal influenza viruses have to be re-formulated and re-administered in a cumbersome process every year due to the antigenic drift of the virus. Furthermore, current seasonal vaccines are ineffective against novel pandemic strains. This paper reviews zoonotic influenza viruses with pandemic potential and technological advances towards better vaccines that induce broad and long lasting protection from influenza virus infection. Recent efforts have focused on the development of broadly protective/universal influenza virus vaccines that can provide immunity against drifted seasonal influenza virus strains but also against potential pandemic viruses."
1,Virus incidence in wheat increases under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>: A 4-year study of yellow dwarf viruses from a free air carbon dioxide facility.,"The complexities behind the mechanisms associated with virus-host-vector interactions of vector-transmitted viruses, and their consequences for disease development need to be understood to reduce virus spread and disease severity. Climate has a substantial effect on viruses, vectors, host plants and their interactions. Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is predicted to impact the interactions between them. This study, conducted under ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (550??molmol<sup>-1</sup>), in the Australian Grains Free Air Carbon Enrichment facility reports on natural yellow dwarf virus incidence on wheat (including Barley/Cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDV)). A range of wheat cultivars was tested using tissue blot immunoassay to determine the incidence of four yellow dwarf virus species from 2013 to 2016. In 2013, 2014 and 2016, virus incidence was high, reaching upwards of 50%, while in 2015 it was relatively low, with a maximum incidence of 3%. Across all years and most cultivars, BYDV-PAV was the most prevalent virus species. In the years with high virus incidence, a majority plots with the elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>) were associated with increased levels of virus relative to the plots with ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. In 2013, 2014 and 2016 the recorded mean percent virus incidence was higher under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> when compared to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> by 33%, 14% and 34%, respectively. The mechanism behind increased yellow dwarf virus incidence under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> is not well understood. Potential factors involved in the higher virus incidence under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions are discussed."
1,Natural co-infection of influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 viruses resulting in a reassortant A/H3N2 virus.,"Despite annual co-circulation of different subtypes of seasonal influenza, co-infections between different viruses are rarely detected. These co-infections can result in the emergence of reassortant progeny.We document the detection of an influenza co-infection, between influenza A/H3N2 with A/H1N1pdm09 viruses, which occurred in a 3 year old male in Cambodia during April 2014. Both viruses were detected in the patient at relatively high viral loads (as determined by real-time RT-PCR CT values), which is unusual for influenza co-infections. As reassortment can occur between co-infected influenza A strains we isolated plaque purified clonal viral populations from the clinical material of the patient infected with A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09.Complete genome sequences were completed for 7 clonal viruses to determine if any reassorted viruses were generated during the influenza virus co-infection. Although most of the viral sequences were consistent with wild-type A/H3N2 or A/H1N1pdm09, one reassortant A/H3N2 virus was isolated which contained an A/H1N1pdm09 NS1 gene fragment. The reassortant virus was viable and able to infect cells, as judged by successful passage in MDCK cells, achieving a TCID50 of 10(4)/ml at passage number two. There is no evidence that the reassortant virus was transmitted further. The co-infection occurred during a period when co-circulation of A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 was detected in Cambodia.It is unclear how often influenza co-infections occur, but laboratories should consider influenza co-infections during routine surveillance activities."
1,A novel H6N1 virus-like particle vaccine induces long-lasting cross-clade antibody immunity against human and avian H6N1 viruses.,"Avian influenza A(H6N1) virus is one of the most common viruses isolated from migrating birds and domestic poultry in many countries. The first and only known case of human infection by H6N1 virus in the world was reported in Taiwan in 2013. This led to concern that H6N1 virus may cause a threat to public health. In this study, we engineered a recombinant H6N1 virus-like particle (VLP) and investigated its vaccine effectiveness compared to the traditional egg-based whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccine. The H6N1-VLPs exhibited similar morphology and functional characteristics to influenza viruses. Prime-boost intramuscular immunization in mice with unadjuvanted H6N1-VLPs were highly immunogenic and induced long-lasting antibody immunity. The functional activity of the VLP-elicited IgG antibodies was proved by in vitro seroprotective hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization titers against the homologous human H6N1 virus, as well as in vivo viral challenge analyses which showed H6N1-VLP immunization significantly reduced viral load in the lung, and protected against human H6N1 virus infection. Of particular note, the H6N1-VLPs but not the H6N1-WIVs were able to confer cross-reactive humoral immunity; antibodies induced by H6N1-VLP vaccine robustly inhibited the hemagglutination activities and in vitro replication of distantly-related heterologous avian H6N1 viruses. Furthermore, the H6N1-VLPs were found to elicit significantly greater anti-HA2 antibody responses in immunized mice than H6N1-WIVs. Collectively, we demonstrated for the first time a novel H6N1-VLP vaccine that effectively provides broadly protective immunity against both human and avian H6N1 viruses. These results, which uncover the underlying mechanisms for induction of wide-range immunity against influenza viruses, may be useful for future influenza vaccine development."
1,"Virus-like particles displaying H5, H7, H9 hemagglutinins and N1 neuraminidase elicit protective immunity to heterologous avian influenza viruses in chickens.","Avian influenza (AI) viruses circulating in wild birds pose a serious threat to public health. Human and veterinary vaccines against AI subtypes are needed. Here we prepared triple-subtype VLPs that co-localized H5, H7 and H9 antigens derived from H5N1, H7N3 and H9N2 viruses. VLPs also contained influenza N1 neuraminidase and retroviral gag protein. The H5/H7/H9/N1/gag VLPs were prepared using baculovirus expression. Biochemical, functional and antigenic characteristics were determined including hemagglutination and neuraminidase enzyme activities. VLPs were further evaluated in a chicken AI challenge model for safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy against heterologous AI viruses including H5N2, H7N3 and H9N2 subtypes. All vaccinated birds survived challenges with H5N2 and H7N3 highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) viruses, while all controls died. Immune response was also detectable after challenge with low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) H9N2 virus suggesting that H5/H7/H9/N1/gag VLPs represent a promising approach for the development of broadly protective AI vaccine."
1,Novel triple reassortant H1N2 influenza viruses bearing six internal genes of the pandemic 2009/H1N1 influenza virus were detected in pigs in China.,"The pandemic A/H1N1 influenza viruses emerged in both Mexico and the United States in March 2009, and were transmitted efficiently in the human population. Transmissions of the pandemic 2009/H1N1 virus from humans to poultry and other species of mammals were reported from several continents during the course of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Reassortant H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses containing genes of the pandemic 2009/H1N1 viruses appeared in pigs in some countries.In winter of 2012, a total of 2600 nasal swabs were collected from healthy pigs in slaughterhouses located throughout 10 provinces in China. The isolated viruses were subjected to genetic and antigenic analysis. Two novel triple-reassortant H1N2 influenza viruses were isolated from swine in China in 2012, with the HA gene derived from Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1, the NA gene from North American swine H1N2, and the six internal genes from the pandemic 2009/H1N1 viruses. The two viruses had similar antigenic features and some significant changes in antigenic characteristics emerged when compared to the previously identified isolates.We inferred that the novel reassortant viruses in China may have arisen from the accumulation of the three types of influenza viruses, which further indicates that swine herds serve as ""mixing vessels"" for influenza viruses. Influenza virus reassortment is an ongoing process, and our findings highlight the urgent need for continued influenza surveillance among swine herds."
1,Understanding the complex evolution of rapidly mutating viruses with deep sequencing: Beyond the analysis of viral diversity.,"With the advent of affordable deep sequencing technologies, detection of low frequency variants within genetically diverse viral populations can now be achieved with unprecedented depth and efficiency. The high-resolution data provided by next generation sequencing technologies is currently recognised as the gold standard in estimation of viral diversity. In the analysis of rapidly mutating viruses, longitudinal deep sequencing datasets from viral genomes during individual infection episodes, as well as at the epidemiological level during outbreaks, now allow for more sophisticated analyses such as statistical estimates of the impact of complex mutation patterns on the evolution of the viral populations both within and between hosts. These analyses are revealing more accurate descriptions of the evolutionary dynamics that underpin the rapid adaptation of these viruses to the host response, and to drug therapies. This review assesses recent developments in methods and provide informative research examples using deep sequencing data generated from rapidly mutating viruses infecting humans, particularly hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus and influenza virus, to understand the evolution of viral genomes and to explore the relationship between viral mutations and the host adaptive immune response. Finally, we discuss limitations in current technologies, and future directions that take advantage of publically available large deep sequencing datasets."
1,Frequency of respiratory viruses among patients admitted to 26 Intensive Care Units in seven consecutive winter-spring seasons (2009-2016) in Northern Italy.,"The role of respiratory viruses in the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still debated. The advent of molecular assays has improved the identification of viruses in patients with CAP and according to published studies, viruses account for 11-55% of adult CAP cases.In the present study, the frequency of respiratory viruses was evaluated in respiratory samples collected from 414 patients with CAP admitted to 26 ICUs in the Lombardy Region (10 million inhabitants) during seven winter-spring seasons (2009-2016).In 226 (54.6%) patients one or more respiratory viruses were identified, while 188 (45.4%) patients were negative. A single virus infection was observed in 214/226 (94.7%) patients; while, in 12/226 (5.3%) at least two respiratory viruses were detected. Influenza A was the most common virus in 140/226 patients (61.9%) followed by rhinoviruses (33/226, 14.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (13/226, 5.8%), influenza B virus (9/226, 4.0%), human coronaviruses (9/226, 4.0%), cytomegalovirus (9/226, 4.0%) and human metapneumovirus (1/226, 0.4%).Viral infections are present in a consistent proportion of patients admitted to the ICU for CAP. Influenza A and rhinovirus accounted for three-quarters of all CAP in ICU patients. The use of lower respiratory instead of upper respiratory samples might be useful in the diagnosis of viral CAP."
1,Diversity of dsDNA Viruses in a South African Hot Spring Assessed by Metagenomics and Microscopy.,"The current view of virus diversity in terrestrial hot springs is limited to a few sampling sites. To expand our current understanding of hot spring viral community diversity, this study aimed to investigate the first African hot spring (Brandvlei hot spring; 60 ??C, pH 5.7) by means of electron microscopy and sequencing of the virus fraction. Microscopy analysis revealed a mixture of regular- and 'jumbo'-sized tailed morphotypes (<i>Caudovirales</i>), lemon-shaped virions (<i>Fuselloviridae-</i>like; salterprovirus-like) and pleiomorphic virus-like particles. Metavirome analysis corroborated the presence of His1-like viruses and has expanded the current clade of salterproviruses using a polymerase B gene phylogeny. The most represented viral contig was to a cyanophage genome fragment, which may underline basic ecosystem functioning provided by these viruses. Furthermore, a putative <i>Gemmata</i>-related phage was assembled with high coverage, a previously undocumented phage-host association. This study demonstrated that a moderately thermophilic spring environment contained a highly novel pool of viruses and should encourage future characterization of a wider temperature range of hot springs throughout the world."
1,<i>Saccharomyces paradoxus</i> K66 Killer System Evidences Expanded Assortment of Helper and Satellite Viruses.,"The <i>Saccharomycetaceae</i> yeast family recently became recognized for expanding of the repertoire of different dsRNA-based viruses, highlighting the need for understanding of their cross-dependence. We isolated the <i>Saccharomyces paradoxus</i> AML-15-66 killer strain from spontaneous fermentation of serviceberries and identified helper and satellite viruses of the family <i>Totiviridae</i>, which are responsible for the killing phenotype. The corresponding full dsRNA genomes of viruses have been cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis of SpV-LA-66 identified it to be most similar to <i>S. paradoxus</i> LA-28 type viruses, while SpV-M66 was mostly similar to the SpV-M21 virus. Sequence and functional analysis revealed significant differences between the K66 and the K28 toxins. The structural organization of the K66 protein resembled those of the K1/K2 type toxins. The AML-15-66 strain possesses the most expressed killing property towards the K28 toxin-producing strain. A genetic screen performed on <i>S. cerevisiae</i> YKO library strains revealed 125 gene products important for the functioning of the <i>S. paradoxus</i> K66 toxin, with 85% of the discovered modulators shared with <i>S. cerevisiae</i> K2 or K1 toxins. Investigation of the K66 protein binding to cells and different polysaccharides implies the ??-1,6 glucans to be the primary receptors of <i>S. paradoxus</i> K66 toxin. For the first time, we demonstrated the coherent habitation of different types of helper and satellite viruses in a wild-type <i>S. paradoxus</i> strain."
1,Applications of Replicating-Competent Reporter-Expressing Viruses in Diagnostic and Molecular Virology.,"Commonly used tests based on wild-type viruses, such as immunostaining, cannot meet the demands for rapid detection of viral replication, high-throughput screening for antivirals, as well as for tracking viral proteins or virus transport in real time. Notably, the development of replicating-competent reporter-expressing viruses (RCREVs) has provided an excellent option to detect directly viral replication without the use of secondary labeling, which represents a significant advance in virology. This article reviews the applications of RCREVs in diagnostic and molecular virology, including rapid neutralization tests, high-throughput screening systems, identification of viral receptors and virus-host interactions, dynamics of viral infections in vitro and in vivo, vaccination approaches and others. However, there remain various challenges associated with RCREVs, including pathogenicity alterations due to the insertion of a reporter gene, instability or loss of the reporter gene expression, or attenuation of reporter signals in vivo. Despite all these limitations, RCREVs have become powerful tools for both basic and applied virology with the development of new technologies for generating RCREVs, the inventions of novel reporters and the better understanding of regulation of viral replication."
1,"Viruses of the Nahant Collection, characterization of 251 marine Vibrionaceae viruses.","Viruses are highly discriminating in their interactions with host cells and are thought to play a major role in maintaining diversity of environmental microbes. However, large-scale ecological and genomic studies of co-occurring virus-host pairs, required to characterize the mechanistic and genomic foundations of virus-host interactions, are lacking. Here, we present the largest dataset of cultivated and sequenced co-occurring virus-host pairs that captures ecologically representative fine-scale diversity. Using the ubiquitous and ecologically diverse marine Vibrionaceae as a host platform, we isolate and sequence 251 dsDNA viruses and their hosts from three time points within a 93-day time-series study. The virus collection includes representatives of the three Caudovirales tailed virus morphotypes, a novel family of nontailed viruses, and the smallest (10,046?€?bp) and largest (348,911?€?bp) Vibrio virus genomes described. We provide general characterization and annotation of the viruses and describe read-mapping protocols to standardize genome presentation. The rich ecological and genomic contextualization of hosts and viruses make the Nahant Collection a unique platform for high-resolution studies of environmental virus-host infection networks."
1,A multiplex reverse transcription PCR and automated electronic microarray assay for detection and differentiation of seven viruses affecting swine.,"Microarray technology can be useful for pathogen detection as it allows simultaneous interrogation of the presence or absence of a large number of genetic signatures. However, most microarray assays are labour-intensive and time-consuming to perform. This study describes the development and initial evaluation of a multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and novel accompanying automated electronic microarray assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of seven important viruses that affect swine (foot-and-mouth disease virus [FMDV], swine vesicular disease virus [SVDV], vesicular exanthema of swine virus [VESV], African swine fever virus [ASFV], classical swine fever virus [CSFV], porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus [PRRSV] and porcine circovirus type 2 [PCV2]). The novel electronic microarray assay utilizes a single, user-friendly instrument that integrates and automates capture probe printing, hybridization, washing and reporting on a disposable electronic microarray cartridge with 400 features. This assay accurately detected and identified a total of 68 isolates of the seven targeted virus species including 23 samples of FMDV, representing all seven serotypes, and 10 CSFV strains, representing all three genotypes. The assay successfully detected viruses in clinical samples from the field, experimentally infected animals (as early as 1??day post-infection (dpi) for FMDV and SVDV, 4??dpi for ASFV, 5??dpi for CSFV), as well as in biological material that were spiked with target viruses. The limit of detection was 10??copies/??l for ASFV, PCV2 and PRRSV, 100??copies/??l for SVDV, CSFV, VESV and 1,000??copies/??l for FMDV. The electronic microarray component had reduced analytical sensitivity for several of the target viruses when compared with the multiplex RT-PCR. The integration of capture probe printing allows custom onsite array printing as needed, while electrophoretically driven hybridization generates results faster than conventional microarrays that rely on passive hybridization. With further refinement, this novel, rapid, highly automated microarray technology has potential applications in multipathogen surveillance of livestock diseases."
1,Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity of an Ankyrin Repeat Protein on Viral Assembly against Chimeric NL4-3 Viruses Carrying Gag/PR Derived from Circulating Strains among Northern Thai Patients.,"Certain proteins have demonstrated proficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) life cycle disturbance. Recently, the ankyrin repeat protein targeting the HIV-1 capsid, Ank<sup>GAG</sup>1D4, showed a negative effect on the viral assembly of the HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> laboratory strain. To extend its potential for future clinical application, the activity of Ank<sup>GAG</sup>1D4 in the inhibition of other HIV-1 circulating strains was evaluated. Chimeric NL4-3 viruses carrying patient-derived Gag/PR-coding regions were generated from 131 antiretroviral drug-na??ve HIV-1 infected individuals in northern Thailand during 2001???2012. SupT1, a stable T-cell line expressing Ank<sup>GAG</sup>1D4 and ankyrin non-binding control (Ank<sup>A3</sup>2D3), were challenged with these chimeric viruses. The p24CA sequences were analysed and classified using the K-means clustering method. Among all the classes of virus classified using the p24CA sequences, SupT1/Ank<sup>GAG</sup>1D4 demonstrated significantly lower levels of p24CA than SupT1/Ank<sup>A3</sup>2D3, which was found to correlate with the syncytia formation. This result suggests that Ank<sup>GAG</sup>1D4 can significantly interfere with the chimeric viruses derived from patients with different sequences of the p24CA domain. It supports the possibility of ankyrin-based therapy as a broad alternative therapeutic molecule for HIV-1 gene therapy in the future."
1,"Viruses Causing Gastroenteritis: The Known, The New and Those Beyond.","The list of recently discovered gastrointestinal viruses is expanding rapidly. Whether these agents are actually involved in a disease such as diarrhea is the essential question, yet difficult to answer. In this review a summary of all viruses found in diarrhea is presented, together with the current knowledge about their connection to disease. "
1,Low-Pathogenic Influenza A Viruses in North American Diving Ducks Contribute to the Emergence of a Novel Highly Pathogenic Influenza A(H7N8) Virus.,"Introductions of low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of subtypes H5 and H7 into poultry from wild birds have the potential to mutate to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, but such viruses' origins are often unclear. In January 2016, a novel H7N8 HPAI virus caused an outbreak in turkeys in Indiana, USA. To determine the virus's origin, we sequenced the genomes of 441 wild-bird origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) from North America and subjected them to evolutionary analyses. The results showed that the H7N8 LPAI virus most likely circulated among diving ducks in the Mississippi flyway during autumn 2015 and was subsequently introduced to Indiana turkeys, in which it evolved high pathogenicity. Preceding the outbreak, an isolate with six gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NA, and NS) sharing >99% sequence identity with those of H7N8 turkey isolates was recovered from a diving duck sampled in Kentucky, USA. H4N8 IAVs from other diving ducks possessed five H7N8-like gene segments (PB2, PB1, NA, MP, and NS; >98% sequence identity). Our findings suggest that viral gene constellations circulating among diving ducks can contribute to the emergence of IAVs that affect poultry. Therefore, diving ducks may serve an important and understudied role in the maintenance, diversification, and transmission of IAVs in the wild-bird reservoir.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In January 2016, a novel H7N8 HPAI virus caused a disease outbreak in turkeys in Indiana, USA.

1,Modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing the hemagglutinin of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus induces cross-protective immunity against Eurasian 'avian-like' H1N1 swine viruses in mice.,"To examine cross-reactivity between hemagglutinin (HA) derived from A/California/7/09 (CA/09) virus and that derived from representative Eurasian ""avian-like"" (EA) H1N1 swine viruses isolated in Italy between 1999 and 2008 during virological surveillance in pigs.Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the HA gene of CA/09 virus (MVA-HA-CA/09) was used as a vaccine to investigate cross-protective immunity against H1N1 swine viruses in mice.Two classical swine H1N1 (CS) viruses and four representative EA-like H1N1 swine viruses previously isolated during outbreaks of respiratory disease in pigs on farms in Northern Italy were used in this study.Female C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with MVA/HA/CA/09 and then challenged intranasally with H1N1 swine viruses.Cross-reactive antibody responses were determined by hemagglutination- inhibition (HI) and virus microneutralizing (MN) assays of sera from MVA-vaccinated mice. The extent of protective immunity against infection with H1N1 swine viruses was determined by measuring lung viral load on days 2 and 4 post-challenge.Systemic immunization of mice with CA/09-derived HA, vectored by MVA, elicited cross-protective immunity against recent EA-like swine viruses. This immune protection was related to the levels of cross-reactive HI antibodies in the sera of the immunized mice and was dependent on the similarity of the antigenic site Sa of H1 HAs. Our findings suggest that the herd immunity elicited in humans by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus could limit the transmission of recent EA-like swine HA genes into the influenza A virus gene pool in humans."
1,Efficient Inhibition of Avian and Seasonal Influenza A Viruses by a Virus-Specific Dicer-Substrate Small Interfering RNA Swarm in Human Monocyte-Derived Macrophages and Dendritic Cells.,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are viral pathogens that cause epidemics and occasional pandemics of significant mortality. The generation of efficacious vaccines and antiviral drugs remains a challenge due to the rapid appearance of new influenza virus types and antigenic variants. Consequently, novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of IAV infections are needed, given the limitations of the presently available antivirals. Here, we used enzymatically produced IAV-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules and <i>Giardia intestinalis</i> Dicer for the generation of a swarm of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules. The siRNAs target multiple conserved genomic regions of the IAVs. In mammalian cells, the produced 25- to 27-nucleotide-long siRNA molecules are processed by endogenous Dicer into 21-nucleotide siRNAs and are thus designated Dicer-substrate siRNAs (DsiRNAs). We evaluated the efficacy of the above DsiRNA swarm at preventing IAV infections in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. The replication of different IAV strains, including avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, was significantly inhibited by pretransfection of the cells with the IAV-specific DsiRNA swarm. Up to 7 orders of magnitude inhibition of viral RNA expression was observed, which led to a dramatic inhibition of IAV protein synthesis and virus production. The IAV-specific DsiRNA swarm inhibited virus replication directly through the RNA interference pathway although a weak induction of innate interferon responses was detected. Our results provide direct evidence for the feasibility of the siRNA strategy and the potency of DsiRNA swarms in the prevention and treatment of influenza, including the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In spite of the enormous amount of research, influenza virus is still one of the major challenges for medical virology due to its capacity to generate new variants, which potentially lead to severe epidemics and pandemics. We demonstrated here that a swarm of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, including more than 100 different antiviral RNA molecules targeting the most conserved regions of the influenza A virus genome, could efficiently inhibit the replication of all tested avian and seasonal influenza A variants in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. The wide antiviral spectrum makes the virus-specific siRNA swarm a potentially efficient treatment modality against both avian and seasonal influenza viruses."
1,Corexit 9500 inactivates two enveloped viruses of aquatic animals but enhances the infectivity of a nonenveloped fish virus.,"The effects of Corexit 9500, a dispersant used to clean up oil spills, on invertebrates, lower vertebrates, birds, and human health have been examined, but there is a significant lack of study of the effect of this dispersant on aquatic viruses. In this study, the effects of Corexit 9500 on four aquatic viruses of differing structural composition were examined. Corexit 9500 reduced the titer of the enveloped viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) at all concentrations (10% to 0.001%) examined. The titer of frog virus 3 (FV3), a virus with both enveloped and nonenveloped virions, was reduced only at the high Corexit 9500 concentrations (10% to 0.1%). Corexit 9500 was unable to reduce the titer of nonenveloped infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) but enhanced the titer of chum salmon reovirus (CSV) by 2 to 4 logs. With the ability to inactivate enveloped viruses and possibly enhance some nonenveloped viruses, Corexit 9500 has the potential to alter the aquatic virosphere. "
1,A Pelagic Microbiome (Viruses to Protists) from a Small Cup of Seawater.,"The aquatic microbiome is composed of a multi-phylotype community of microbes, ranging from the numerically dominant viruses to the phylogenetically diverse unicellular phytoplankton. They influence key biogeochemical processes and form the base of marine food webs, becoming food for secondary consumers. Due to recent advances in next-generation sequencing, this previously overlooked component of our hydrosphere is starting to reveal its true diversity and biological complexity. We report here that 250 mL of seawater is sufficient to provide a comprehensive description of the microbial diversity in an oceanic environment. We found that there was a dominance of the order <i>Caudovirales</i> (59%), with the family <i>Myoviridae</i> being the most prevalent. The families <i>Phycodnaviridae</i> and <i>Mimiviridae</i> made up the remainder of pelagic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virome. Consistent with this analysis, the Cyanobacteria dominate (52%) the prokaryotic diversity. While the dinoflagellates and their endosymbionts, the superphylum Alveolata dominates (92%) the microbial eukaryotic diversity. A total of 834 prokaryotic, 346 eukaryotic and 254 unique virus phylotypes were recorded in this relatively small sample of water. We also provide evidence, through a metagenomic-barcoding comparative analysis, that viruses are the likely source of microbial environmental DNA (meDNA). This study opens the door to a more integrated approach to oceanographic sampling and data analysis."
1,Comparison of internal process control viruses for detection of food and waterborne viruses.,"Enteric viruses are pathogens associated with food- and waterborne outbreaks. The recovery of viruses from food or water samples is affected by the procedures applied to detect and concentrate them. The incorporation of an internal process control virus to the analyses allows monitoring the performance of the methodology. The aim of this study was to produce a recombinant adenovirus (rAdV) and apply it together with bacteriophage PP7 as process controls. The rAdV carries a DNA construction in its genome to differentiate it from wild-type adenovirus by qPCR. The stability of both control viruses was evaluated at different pH conditions. The rAdV was stable at pH 3, 7, and 10 for 18??h. PP7 infectious particles were stable at pH 7 and showed a 2.14 log reduction at pH 10 and total decay at pH 3 after 18??h. Three virus concentration methods were evaluated: hollow-fiber tap water ultrafiltration, wastewater ultracentrifugation, and elution-PEG precipitation from lettuce. Total and infectious viruses were quantified and their recoveries were calculated. Virus recovery for rAdV and PP7 by ultrafiltration showed a wide range (2.10-84.42 and 13.54-84.62%, respectively), whereas that by ultracentrifugation was 5.05-13.71 and 6.98-13.27%, respectively. The performance of ultracentrifugation to concentrate norovirus and enteroviruses present in sewage was not significantly different to the recovery of control viruses. For detection of viruses from lettuce, genomic copies of PP7 were significantly more highly recovered than adenovirus (14.74-18.82 and 0.00-3.44%, respectively). The recovery of infectious virus particles was significantly affected during sewage ultracentrifugation and concentration from lettuce. The simultaneous use of virus controls with dissimilar characteristics and behaviors might resemble different enteric viruses."
1,The rate of co-infection for piglet diarrhea viruses in China and the genetic characterization of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine kobuvirus.,"Piglet diarrhea epidemics result in major economic losses for the swine industry. Four viruses are closely linked to porcine diarrhea: porcine kobuvirus (PKV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PRoV). We have conducted an epidemiology study to determine the frequency of infection and co-infection with these viruses in China, and characterized the genetic variation of the isolated PEDV and PKV strains. Stool and intestinal samples (n??=??314) were collected from piglets with diarrhea in China from years 2012 to 2014. RT-PCR was used to detect PKV, PEDV, TGEV, and PRoV. Phylogenetic relationships between reference strains and the isolated PEDV and PKV strains were determined based on the M and 3D gene sequence. The rates of infection with PKV, PEDV, TGEV and PRoV were 29.9%, 24.2%, 1.91%, and 0.31%, respectively. Co-infections with PKV and the other three viruses were very common. Co-infection of PKV and PEDV was detected in 15.0% (47/314) of the samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the PKV 3D gene indicated that there were some phylogenetic differences in the PKV strains across regions within China. However, according to the PEDV M gene, strains clustered into three groups and the primary group was distinct from the vaccine strain CV777. This study provides insights in to the prevalence of diarrhea viruses and their prevention and control in China. "
1,Mutagenic Effects of Ribavirin on Hepatitis E Virus-Viral Extinction versus Selection of Fitness-Enhancing Mutations.,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV), an important agent of viral hepatitis worldwide, can cause severe courses of infection in pregnant women and immunosuppressed patients. To date, HEV infections can only be treated with ribavirin (RBV). Major drawbacks of this therapy are that RBV is not approved for administration to pregnant women and that the virus can acquire mutations, which render the intra-host population less sensitive or even resistant to RBV. One of the proposed modes of action of RBV is a direct mutagenic effect on viral genomes, inducing mismatches and subsequent nucleotide substitutions. These transition events can drive the already error-prone viral replication beyond an error threshold, causing viral population extinction. In contrast, the expanded heterogeneous viral population can facilitate selection of mutant viruses with enhanced replication fitness. Emergence of these mutant viruses can lead to therapeutic failure. Consequently, the onset of RBV treatment in chronically HEV-infected individuals can result in two divergent outcomes: viral extinction versus selection of fitness-enhanced viruses. Following an overview of RNA viruses treated with RBV in clinics and a summary of the different antiviral modes of action of this drug, we focus on the mutagenic effect of RBV on HEV intrahost populations, and how HEV is able to overcome lethal mutagenesis."
1,Multi-color fluorescent reporter dengue viruses with improved stability for analysis of a multi-virus infection.,"Reporter virus is a versatile tool to visualize and to analyze virus infections. However, for flaviviruses, it is difficult to maintain the inserted reporter genes on the viral genome, limiting its use in several studies that require homogeneous virus particles and several rounds of virus replication. Here, we showed that flanking inserted GFP genes on both sides with ribosome-skipping 2A sequences improved the stability and the consistency of their fluorescent signals for dengue-virus-serotype 2 (DENV2) reporter viruses. The reporter viruses can infect known susceptible mammalian cell lines and primary CD14+ human monocytes. This design can accommodate several fluorescent protein genes, enabling the generation of multi-color DENV2-16681 reporter viruses with comparable replication capabilities, as demonstrated by their abilities to maintain their fluorescent intensities during co-infections and to exclude superinfections regardless of the fluorescent tags. The reported design of multi-color DENV2 should be useful for high-throughput analyses, single-cell analysis, and characterizations of interference and superinfection in animal models."
1,"Improving the selection and development of influenza vaccine viruses - Report of a WHO informal consultation on improving influenza vaccine virus selection, Hong Kong SAR, China, 18-20 November 2015.","Since 2010 the WHO has held a series of informal consultations to explore ways of improving the currently highly complex and time-pressured influenza vaccine virus selection and development process. In November 2015 experts from around the world met to review the current status of efforts in this field. Discussion topics included strengthening influenza surveillance activities to increase the availability of candidate vaccine viruses and improve the extent, timeliness and quality of surveillance data. Consideration was also given to the development and potential application of newer laboratory assays to better characterize candidate vaccine viruses, the potential importance of antibodies directed against influenza virus neuraminidase, and the role of vaccine effectiveness studies. Advances in next generation sequencing and whole genome sequencing of influenza viruses were also discussed, along with associated developments in synthetic genomics technologies, evolutionary analysis and predictive mathematical modelling. Discussions were also held on the late emergence of an antigenic variant influenza A(H3N2) virus in mid-2014 that could not be incorporated in time into the 2014-15 northern hemisphere vaccine. There was broad recognition that given the current highly constrained influenza vaccine development and production timeline it would remain impossible to incorporate any variant virus which emerged significantly long after the relevant WHO biannual influenza vaccine composition meetings. Discussions were also held on the development of pandemic and broadly protective vaccines, and on associated regulatory and manufacturing requirements and constraints. With increasing awareness of the health and economic burdens caused by seasonal influenza, the ever-present threat posed by zoonotic influenza viruses, and the significant impact of the 2014-15 northern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine mismatch, this consultation provided a very timely opportunity to share developments and exchange views. In all areas, a renewed and strengthened emphasis was placed on developing concrete and measurable actions and identifying the key stakeholders responsible for their implementation."
1,Evaluation of cell viability dyes in antiviral assays with RNA viruses that exhibit different cytopathogenic properties.,"Studies were conducted to determine the performance of four dyes in assessing antiviral activities of compounds against three RNA viruses with differing cytopathogenic properties. Dyes included alamarBlue<sup>??</sup> measured by absorbance (ALB-A) and fluorescence (ALB-F), neutral red (NR), Viral ToxGlo??? (VTG), and WST-1. Viruses were chikungunya, dengue type 2, and Junin, which generally cause 100, 80-90, and 50% maximal cytopathic effect (CPE), respectively, in Vero or Vero 76 cells Compounds evaluated were 6-azauridine, BCX-4430, 3-deazaguanine, EICAR, favipiravir, infergen, mycophenolic acid (MPA), ribavirin, and tiazofurin. The 50% virus-inhibitory (EC<sub>50</sub>) values for each inhibitor and virus combination did not vary significantly based on the dye used. However, dyes varied in distinguishing the vitality of virus-infected cultures when not all cells were killed by virus infection. For example, VTG uptake into dengue-infected cells was nearly 50% when visual examination showed only 10-20% cell survival. ALB-A measured infected cell viability differently than ALB-F as follows: 16% versus 32% (dengue-infected), respectively, and 51% versus 72% (Junin-infected), respectively. Cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub>) assays with dyes in uninfected proliferating cells produced similar CC<sub>50</sub> values for EICAR (1.5-8.9??M) and MPA (0.8-2.5??M). 6-Azauridine toxicity was 6.1-17.5??M with NR, VTG, and WST-1, compared to 48-92??M with ALB-A and ALB-F (P<0.001). Curiously, the CC<sub>50</sub> values for 3-deazaguanine were 83-93??M with ALB-F versus 2.4-7.0??M with all other dyes including ALB-A (P<0.001). Overall, ALB minimized the toxicities detected with these two inhibitors. Because the choice of dyes affected CC<sub>50</sub> values, this impacted on the resulting in vitro selectivity indexes (calculated as CC<sub>50</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub> ratio)."
1,North American triple reassortant and Eurasian H1N1 swine influenza viruses do not readily reassort to generate a 2009 pandemic H1N1-like virus.,"The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (pH1N1) was derived through reassortment of North American triple reassortant and Eurasian avian-like swine influenza viruses (SIVs). To date, when, how and where the pH1N1 arose is not understood. To investigate viral reassortment, we coinfected cell cultures and a group of pigs with or without preexisting immunity with a Eurasian H1N1 virus, A/Swine/Spain/53207/2004 (SP04), and a North American triple reassortant H1N1 virus, A/Swine/Kansas/77778/2007 (KS07). The infected pigs were cohoused with one or two groups of contact animals to investigate viral transmission. In coinfected MDCK or PK15 continuous cell lines with KS07 and SP04 viruses, more than 20 different reassortant viruses were found. In pigs without or with preexisting immunity (immunized with commercial inactivated swine influenza vaccines) and coinfected with both viruses, six or seven reassortant viruses, as well as the parental viruses, were identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from the lungs. Interestingly, only one or two viruses transmitted to and were detected in contact animals. No reassortant containing a gene constellation similar to that of pH1N1 virus was found in either coinfected cells or pigs, indicating that the reassortment event that resulted in the generation of this virus is a rare event that likely involved specific viral strains and/or a favorable, not-yet-understood environment. IMPORTANCE The 2009 pandemic-like H1N1 virus could not be reproduced either in cell cultures or in pigs coinfected with North American triple reassortant H1N1 and Eurasian H1N1 swine influenza viruses. This finding suggests that the generation of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus by reassortment was a rare event that likely involved specific viral strains and unknown factors. Different reassortant viruses were detected in coinfected pigs with and without preexisting immunity, indicating that host immunity plays a relevant role in driving viral reassortment of influenza A virus."
1,H7N9 and other pathogenic avian influenza viruses elicit a three-pronged transcriptomic signature that is reminiscent of 1918 influenza virus and is associated with lethal outcome in mice.,"Modulating the host response is a promising approach to treating influenza, caused by a virus whose pathogenesis is determined in part by the reaction it elicits within the host. Though the pathogenicity of emerging H7N9 influenza virus in several animal models has been reported, these studies have not included a detailed characterization of the host response following infection. Therefore, we characterized the transcriptomic response of BALB/c mice infected with H7N9 (A/Anhui/01/2013) virus and compared it to the responses induced by H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004), H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003), and pandemic 2009 H1N1 (A/Mexico/4482/2009) influenza viruses. We found that responses to the H7 subtype viruses were intermediate to those elicited by H5N1 and pdm09H1N1 early in infection but that they evolved to resemble the H5N1 response as infection progressed. H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 viruses were pathogenic in mice, and this pathogenicity correlated with increased transcription of cytokine response genes and decreased transcription of lipid metabolism and coagulation signaling genes. This three-pronged transcriptomic signature was observed in mice infected with pathogenic H1N1 strains such as the 1918 virus, indicating that it may be predictive of pathogenicity across multiple influenza virus strains. Finally, we used host transcriptomic profiling to computationally predict drugs that reverse the host response to H7N9 infection, and we identified six FDA-approved drugs that could potentially be repurposed to treat H7N9 and other pathogenic influenza viruses.Emerging avian influenza viruses are of global concern because the human population is immunologically naive to them. Current influenza drugs target viral molecules, but the high mutation rate of influenza viruses eventually leads to the development of antiviral resistance. As the host evolves far more slowly than the virus, and influenza pathogenesis is determined in part by the host response, targeting the host response is a promising approach to treating influenza. Here we characterize the host transcriptomic response to emerging H7N9 influenza virus and compare it with the responses to H7N7, H5N1, and pdm09H1N1. All three avian viruses were pathogenic in mice and elicited a transcriptomic signature that also occurs in response to the legendary 1918 influenza virus. Our work identifies host responses that could be targeted to treat severe H7N9 influenza and identifies six FDA-approved drugs that could potentially be repurposed as H7N9 influenza therapeutics."
1,"""The evil virus cell"": Students' knowledge and beliefs about viruses.","Education about virus biology at school is of pivotal interest to raise public awareness concerning means of disease transmission and, thus, methods to prevent infection, and to reduce unnecessary antibiotic treatment due to patient pressure on physicians in case of viral diseases such as influenza. This study aimed at making visible the knowledge of Austrian high school and university students with respect to virus biology, virus structure and health-education issues. The data presented here stem from comprehensive questionnaire analyses, including the task to draw a virus, from a cross-sectional study with 133 grade 7 and 199 grade 10 high school students, and 133 first-year biology and 181 first-year non-biology university students. Analyses were performed both quantitatively and qualitatively. ANOVA revealed a highly significant group effect for total knowledge relating to virus biology and health issues (F(3, 642) = 44.17, p < 0.01, ??2p = 0.17). Specific post-hoc tests by means of the Tukey test showed significant differences between all groups (p < .01) with the exception of 1st year non-biology students and grade 10 high school students. Students enrolled in university-level biology outperformed all other groups, even though they had not yet encountered this topic at their courses; part of this phenomenon might be due to their affinity for learning about biological topics. However, even many first-year biology students had a high number of severe misconceptions, e.g., defining a virus as a pro- or eukaryotic cell, or falsely naming malaria as a viral disease. Since there was no significant difference in virus-related knowledge between high schools, virus biology seems to have been taught similarly among the tested schools. However, the majority of participants stated that the virus-related knowledge they had acquired at school was not sufficient. Based on the results presented here we urgently suggest improving and intensifying teaching this topic at school, since virus-related knowledge was by far too fragmentary among many participants. Such lack of health-relevant knowledge may contribute to pressure on physicians by patients to unnecessarily prescribe antibiotics, and possibly lead to potentially dangerous neglect concerning vaccination. The effectiveness of newly developed virus-related teaching units and material could be tested with the instrument used here."
1,Use of plant viruses and virus-like particles for the creation of novel vaccines.,"In recent decades, the development of plant virology and genetic engineering techniques has resulted in the construction of plant virus-based vaccines for protection against different infectious agents, cancers and autoimmune diseases in both humans and animals. Interaction studies between plant viruses and mammalian organisms have suggested that plant viruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) are safe and noninfectious to humans and animals. Plant viruses with introduced antigens are powerful vaccine components due to their strongly organized, repetitive spatial structure; they can elicit strong immune responses similar to those observed with infectious mammalian viruses. The analysis of published data demonstrated that at least 73 experimental vaccines, including 61 prophylactic and 12 therapeutic vaccines, have been constructed using plant viruses as a carrier structure for presentation of different antigens. This information clearly demonstrates that noninfectious viruses are also applicable as vaccine carriers. Moreover, several plant viruses have been used for platform development, and corresponding vaccines are currently being tested in human and veterinary clinical trials. This review therefore discusses the main principles of plant VLP vaccine construction, emphasizing the physical, chemical, genetic and immunological aspects. Results of the latest studies suggest that several plant virus-based vaccines will join the list of approved human and animal vaccines in the near future."
1,Quantitative Assessment of the Health Risk for Livestock When Animal Viruses Are Applied in Human Oncolytic Therapy: A Case Study for Seneca Valley Virus.,"Some viruses cause tumor regression and can be used to treat cancer patients; these viruses are called oncolytic viruses. To assess whether oncolytic viruses from animal origin excreted by patients pose a health risk for livestock, a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) was performed to estimate the risk for the Dutch pig industry after environmental release of Seneca Valley virus (SVV). The QRA assumed SVV excretion in stool by one cancer patient on Day 1 in the Netherlands, discharge of SVV with treated wastewater into the river Meuse, downstream intake of river water for drinking water production, and consumption of this drinking water by pigs. Dose-response curves for SVV infection and clinical disease in pigs were constructed from experimental data. In the worst scenario (four log<sub>10</sub> virus reduction by drinking water treatment and a farm with 10,000 pigs), the infection risk is less than 1% with 95% certainty. The risk of clinical disease is almost seven orders of magnitude lower. Risks may increase proportionally with the numbers of treated patients and days of virus excretion. These data indicate that application of wild-type oncolytic animal viruses may infect susceptible livestock. A QRA regarding the use of oncolytic animal virus is, therefore, highly recommended. For this, data on excretion by patients, and dose-response parameters for infection and clinical disease in livestock, should be studied."
1,"Integrated human-virus metabolic stoichiometric modelling predicts host-based antiviral targets against Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika viruses.","Current and reoccurring viral epidemic outbreaks such as those caused by the Zika virus illustrate the need for rapid development of antivirals. Such development would be facilitated by computational approaches that can provide experimentally testable predictions for possible antiviral strategies. To this end, we focus here on the fact that viruses are directly dependent on their host metabolism for reproduction. We develop a stoichiometric, genome-scale metabolic model that integrates human macrophage cell metabolism with the biochemical demands arising from virus production and use it to determine the virus impact on host metabolism and vice versa. While this approach applies to any host-virus pair, we first apply it to currently epidemic viruses Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika in this study. We find that each of these viruses causes specific alterations in the host metabolic flux towards fulfilling their biochemical demands as predicted by their genome and capsid structure. Subsequent analysis of this integrated model allows us to predict a set of host reactions, which, when constrained, inhibit virus production. We show that this prediction recovers known targets of existing antiviral drugs, specifically those targeting nucleotide production, while highlighting a set of hitherto unexplored reactions involving both amino acid and nucleotide metabolic pathways, with either broad or virus-specific antiviral potential. Thus, this computational approach allows rapid generation of experimentally testable hypotheses for novel antiviral targets within a host."
1,Pseudotyping of vesicular stomatitis virus with the envelope glycoproteins of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.,"Pseudotype viruses are useful for studying the envelope proteins of harmful viruses. This work describes the pseudotyping of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with the envelope glycoproteins of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. VSV lacking the homotypic glycoprotein (G) gene (VSV??G) was used to express haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) or the combination of both. Propagation-competent pseudotype viruses were only obtained when HA and NA were expressed from the same vector genome. Pseudotype viruses containing HA from different H5 clades were neutralized specifically by immune sera directed against the corresponding clade. Fast and sensitive reading of test results was achieved by vector-mediated expression of GFP. Pseudotype viruses expressing a mutant VSV matrix protein showed restricted spread in IFN-competent cells. This pseudotype system will facilitate the detection of neutralizing antibodies against virulent influenza viruses, circumventing the need for high-level biosafety containment. "
1,Virus found in a boreal lake links ssDNA and dsDNA viruses.,"Viruses have impacted the biosphere in numerous ways since the dawn of life. However, the evolution, genetic, structural, and taxonomic diversity of viruses remain poorly understood, in part because sparse sampling of the virosphere has concentrated mostly on exploring the abundance and diversity of dsDNA viruses. Furthermore, viral genomes are highly diverse, and using only the current sequence-based methods for classifying viruses and studying their phylogeny is complicated. Here we describe a virus, FLiP (<i>Flavobacterium</i>-infecting, lipid-containing phage), with a circular ssDNA genome and an internal lipid membrane enclosed in the icosahedral capsid. The 9,174-nt-long genome showed limited sequence similarity to other known viruses. The genetic data imply that this virus might use replication mechanisms similar to those found in other ssDNA replicons. However, the structure of the viral major capsid protein, elucidated at near-atomic resolution using cryo-electron microscopy, is strikingly similar to that observed in dsDNA viruses of the PRD1-adenovirus lineage, characterized by a major capsid protein bearing two ??-barrels. The strong similarity between FLiP and another member of the structural lineage, bacteriophage PM2, extends to the capsid organization (pseudo <i>T</i> = 21 <i>dextro</i>) despite the difference in the genetic material packaged and the lack of significant sequence similarity."
1,Hepatitis E Virus and Related Viruses in Animals.,"Hepatitis E is an acute human liver disease in healthy individuals which may eventually become chronic. It is caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and can have a zoonotic origin. Nearly 57,000 people die yearly from hepatitis E-related conditions. The disease is endemic in both developing and developed countries with distinct epidemiologic profiles. In developing countries, the disease is associated with inadequate water treatment, while in developed countries, transmission is associated with animal contact and the ingestion of raw or uncooked meat, especially liver. All human HEV are grouped into at least four genotypes, while HEV or HEV-related viruses have been identified in an increasing number of domestic and wild animal species. Despite a high genetic diversity, only one single HEV serotype has been described to date for HEV genotypes 1-4. The discovery of new HEV or HEV-related viruses leads to a continuing increase in the number of genotypes. In addition, the genome organization of all these viruses is variable with overlapping open reading frames (ORF) and differences in the location of ORF3. In spite of the role of some domestic and wild animals as reservoir, the origin of HEV and HEV-related viruses in humans and animals is still unclear. This review discusses aspects of the detection, molecular virology, zoonotic transmission and origin of HEV and HEV-related viruses in the context of 'One Health' and establishes a link between the previous and the new taxonomy of this growing virus family."
1,"Mutations that increase the stability of the post-fusion gp41 conformation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein are selected by both an X4 and R5 HIV-1 virus to escape fusion inhibitors corresponding to heptad repeat 1 of gp41, but the gp120 adaptive mutations differ between the two viruses.","Binding of the gp120 surface subunit of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV-1 to CD4 and chemokine receptors on target cells triggers refolding of the gp41 transmembrane subunit into a six-helix bundle (6HB) that promotes fusion between virus and host cell membranes. To elucidate details of Env entry and potential differences between viruses that use CXCR4 (X4) or CCR5 (R5) co-receptors, we generated viruses that are resistant to peptide fusion inhibitors corresponding to the first heptad-repeat region (HR1) of gp41 that target fusion-intermediate conformations of Env. Previously we reported that an R5 virus selected two resistance pathways, each defined by an early gp41 resistance mutation in either the HR1 or second heptad repeat (HR2), to escape inhibition by an HR1 peptide, but preferentially selected the HR1 pathway to escape inhibition by a trimer-stabilized HR1 peptide. Here, we report that an X4 virus selected the same HR1 and HR2 resistance pathways as the R5 virus to escape inhibition by the HR1 peptide. However, in contrast to the R5 virus, the X4 virus selected a unique mutation in HR2 to escape inhibition by the trimer-stabilized peptide. Significantly, both of these X4 and R5 viruses acquired gp41 resistance mutations that improved the thermostability of the six-helix bundle, but they selected different gp120 adaptive mutations. These findings show that these X4 and R5 viruses use a similar resistance mechanism to escape from HR1 peptide inhibition, but different gp120-gp41 interactions to regulate Env conformational changes.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> HIV-1 fuses with cells when the gp41 subunit of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) refolds into a six-helix bundle (6HB) after binding to cellular receptors. Peptides corresponding to the first or second gp41 heptad repeats (HR1 or HR2, respectively) interrupt gp41 refolding and inhibit HIV infection. Previously, we found that a CCR5 coreceptor-tropic HIV-1 acquired a key HR1 or HR2 resistance mutation to escape HR1 peptide inhibitors, but only the key HR1 mutation to escape a trimer-stabilized, HR1 peptide inhibitor. Here we report that a CXCR4 coreceptor-tropic HIV-1 selected the same key HR1 or HR2 mutations to escape inhibition by the HR1 peptide, but different combinations of HR1 and HR2 mutations to escape the trimer-stabilized HR1 peptide. All gp41 mutations enhance 6HB stability to outcompete inhibitors, but gp120 adaptive mutations differed between these R5 and X4 viruses, providing new insights into gp120-gp41 functional interactions affecting Env refolding during HIV entry."
1,The PB2 Polymerase Host Adaptation Substitutions Prime Avian Indonesia Sub Clade 2.1 H5N1 Viruses for Infecting Humans.,"Significantly higher numbers of human infections with H5N1 virus have occurred in Indonesia and Egypt, compared with other affected areas, and it is speculated that there are specific viral factors for human infection with avian H5N1 viruses in these locations. We previously showed PB2-K526R is present in 80% of Indonesian H5N1 human isolates, which lack the more common PB2-E627K substitution. Testing the hypothesis that this mutation may prime avian H5N1 virus for human infection, we showed that: (1) K526R is rarely found in avian influenza viruses but was identified in H5N1 viruses 2???3 years after the virus emerged in Indonesia, coincident with the emergence of H5N1 human infections in Indonesia; (2) K526R is required for efficient replication of Indonesia H5N1 virus in mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo and reverse substitution to 526K in human isolates abolishes this ability; (3) Indonesian H5N1 virus, which contains K526R-PB2, is stable and does not further acquire E627K following replication in infected mice; and (4) virus containing K526R-PB2 shows no fitness deficit in avian species. These findings illustrate an important mechanism in which a host adaptive mutation that predisposes avian H5N1 virus towards infecting humans has arisen with the virus becoming prevalent in avian species prior to human infections occurring. A similar mechanism is observed in the Qinghai-lineage H5N1 viruses that have caused many human cases in Egypt; here, E627K predisposes towards human infections. Surveillance should focus on the detection of adaptation markers in avian strains that prime for human infection."
1,Expanding the host range of small insect RNA viruses: Providence virus (Carmotetraviridae) infects and replicates in a human tissue culture cell line.,"Tetraviruses are small, positive (+ve)-sense ssRNA viruses that infect the midgut cells of lepidopteran larvae. Providence virus (PrV) is the only member of the family Carmotetraviridae (previously Tetraviridae). PrV particles exhibit the characteristic tetraviral T=4 icosahedral symmetry, but PrV is distinct from other tetraviruses with respect to genome organization and viral non-structural proteins. Currently, PrV is the only tetravirus known to infect and replicate in lepidopteran cell culture lines. In this report we demonstrate, using immunofluorescence microscopy, that PrV infects and replicates in a human tissue culture cell line (HeLa), producing infectious virus particles. We also provide evidence for PrV replication in vitro in insect, mammalian and plant cell-free systems. This study challenges the long-held view that tetraviruses have a narrow host range confined to one or a few lepidopteran species and highlights the need to consider the potential for apparently non-infectious viruses to be transferred to new hosts in the laboratory."
1,Reassortment ability of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus with circulating human and avian influenza viruses: public health risk implications.,"Exploring the reassortment ability of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (A/H1N1pdm09) influenza virus with other circulating human or avian influenza viruses is the main concern related to the generation of more virulent or new variants having implications for public health. After different coinfection experiments in human A549 cells, by using the A/H1N1pdm09 virus plus one of human seasonal influenza viruses of H1N1 and H3N2 subtype or one of H11, H10, H9, H7 and H1 avian influenza viruses, several reassortant viruses were obtained. Among these, the HA of H1N1 was the main segment of human seasonal influenza virus reassorted in the A/H1N1pdm09 virus backbone. Conversely, HA and each of the three polymerase segments, alone or in combination, of the avian influenza viruses mainly reassorted in the A/H1N1pdm09 virus backbone. Of note, A/H1N1pdm09 viruses that reassorted with HA of H1N1 seasonal human or H11N6 avian viruses or carried different combination of avian origin polymerase segments, exerted a higher replication effectiveness than that of the parental viruses. These results confirm that reassortment of the A/H1N1pdm09 with circulating low pathogenic avian influenza viruses should not be misjudged in the prediction of the next pandemic."
1,A Bivalent Heterologous DNA Virus-Like-Particle Prime-Boost Vaccine Elicits Broad Protection against both Group 1 and 2 Influenza A Viruses.,"Current seasonal influenza vaccines are efficacious when vaccine strains are matched with circulating strains. However, they do not protect antigenic variants and newly emerging pandemic and outbreak strains. Thus, there is a critical need for developing so-called ""universal"" vaccines that protect against all influenza viruses. In the present study, we developed a bivalent heterologous DNA virus-like particle prime-boost vaccine strategy. We show that mice immunized with this vaccine were broadly protected against lethal challenge from group 1 (H1, H5, and H9) and group 2 (H3 and H7) viruses, with 94% aggregate survival. To determine the immune correlates of protection, we performed passive immunizations and <i>in vitro</i> assays. We show that this vaccine elicited antibody responses that bound HA from group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, and H12) and group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, and H15) and neutralized homologous and intrasubtypic H5 and H7 and heterosubtypic H1 viruses and hemagglutinin-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. As a result, passive immunization with immune sera fully protected mice against H5, H7, and H1 challenge, whereas with both immune sera and T cells the mice survived heterosubtypic H3 and H9 challenge. Thus, it appears that (i) neutralizing antibodies alone fully protect against homologous and intrasubtypic H5 and H7 and (ii) neutralizing and binding antibodies are sufficient to protect against heterosubtypic H1, (iii) but against heterosubtypic H3 and H9, binding antibodies and T cells are required for complete survival. We believe that this vaccine regimen could potentially be a candidate for a ""universal"" influenza vaccine.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza virus infection is global health problem. Current seasonal influenza vaccines are efficacious only when vaccine strains are matched with circulating strains. However, these vaccines do not protect antigenic variants and newly emerging pandemic and outbreak strains. Because of this, there is an urgent need to develop so-called ""universal"" influenza vaccines that can protect against both current and future influenza strains. In the present study, we developed a bivalent heterologous prime-boost vaccine strategy. We show that a bivalent vaccine regimen elicited broad binding and neutralizing antibody and T cell responses that conferred broad protection against diverse challenge viruses in mice, suggesting that this bivalent prime-boost strategy could practically be a candidate for a ""universal"" influenza vaccine."
1,Measuring Influenza Virus Infection Using Bioluminescent Reporter Viruses for In Vivo Imaging and In Vitro Replication Assays.,"To streamline standard virological assays, we developed bioluminescent replication-competent influenza reporter viruses that mimic their parental counterparts. These reporter viruses provide a rapid and quantitative readout of viral infection and replication. Moreover, they permit real-time in vivo measures of viral load, tissue distribution, and transmission in the same cohort of animals over the entire course of infection-measurements that were not previously possible. Here we provide detailed protocols using bioluminescent reporter viruses for in vivo imaging in mice and ferrets. We also describe cell culture-based techniques using reporter viruses for quantification of viral titers and performing microneutralization assays. The ease, speed, and adaptability of these approaches have the potential to accelerate multiple areas of influenza virus research."
1,Lung epithelial cells have virus-specific and shared gene expression responses to infection by diverse respiratory viruses.,"The severity of respiratory viral infections is partially determined by the cellular response mounted by infected lung epithelial cells. Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host responses to viruses from different families while controlling other experimental parameters. Murine models are commonly used to study the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, and in vitro studies using murine cells provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis observed in vivo. We used microarray analysis to compare changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1. Our comparative approach identified universal and specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection that can be used to distinguish shared and virus-specific mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract."
1,Novel viruses in birds: Flying through the roof or is a cage needed?,"Emerging viral diseases continue to have a major global impact on human beings and animals. To be able to take adequate measures in case of an outbreak of an emerging disease, rapid detection of the causative agent is a crucial first step. In this review, various aspects of virus discovery are discussed, with a special focus on recently discovered viruses in birds. Novel viruses with a potential major impact have been discovered in domestic and wild bird species in recent years using various virus discovery methods. Only a few studies report the detection of novel viruses in endangered bird species, although increased knowledge about viruses circulating in these species is important. Additional studies focusing on the exact role of a novel virus in disease and on the impact of a novel virus on bird populations are often lacking. Intensive collaboration between different disciplines is needed to obtain useful information about the role of these novel viruses."
1,"Emergence of H3N2pM-like and novel reassortant H3N1 swine viruses possessing segments derived from the A (H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus, Korea.","Human-to-swine transmission of the pandemic H1N1 2009 [A(H1N1)pdm09] virus in pig populations resulted in reassortment events with endemic swine influenza viruses worldwide.We investigated whether A(H1N1)pdm09-derived reassortant viruses are present in South Korea and sought to determine the pathogenic potential of the novel swine viruses.Pig lung tissues were collected from commercially slaughtered pigs. Isolated swine influenza viruses were genetically analyzed and characterized in vitro and in vivo.We identified reassortant H3N2 (H3N2pM-like) and H3N1 swine viruses containing A(H1N1)pdm09-like segments in Korean pigs that are genetically closely related to strains recently detected in pigs and humans in North America. Although the H3N2pM-like and novel H3N1 reassortants demonstrated efficient replication in mice and ferrets, all the H3N1 strains exhibited growth advantage over the representative H3N2pM-like virus in human airway cells. Interestingly, A/swine/Korea/CY02-07/2012(H3N1) and A/swine/Korea/CY03-13/2012(H3N1) reassortants were more readily transmitted to respiratory-droplet-contact ferrets compared with the H3N2pM-like (A/swine/Korea/CY02-10/2012) isolate. Furthermore, serologic evaluation showed poor antigenicity to contemporary reference human seasonal H3N2 vaccine strains.We report here for the first time the isolation of H3N2pM-like viruses outside North America and of novel reassortant swine H3N1 viruses with A(H1N1)pdm09-derived genes. Apart from further complicating the genetic diversity of influenza A viruses circulating in domestic pigs, our data also indicate that these strains could potentially pose threat to public health asserting the need for continuous virus monitoring in these ecologically important hosts."
1,"Seroprevalence of Cache Valley virus and related viruses in sheep and other livestock from Saskatchewan, Canada.","Cache Valley virus, an orthobunyavirus, is an important cause of ovine neonatal malformations. Information on the seroprevalence of this virus in Saskatchewan livestock populations is lacking. The objectives of this study were to determine the seroprevalence of Cache Valley virus and closely related viruses in sheep, cattle, goats, horses, and mule deer in Saskatchewan by performing a plaque-reduction neutralization test using Cache Valley virus. In total, sera from 130 sheep from 50 flocks were tested. Seroprevalence in sheep was 64.6% (84/130) and 94.0% (47/50) of flocks had 1 or more seropositive sheep. Antibodies to Cache Valley virus or closely related viruses were also detected in serum samples collected from cattle, goats, horses, and mule deer with seroprevalences of 20.0% (5/25), 33.3% (8/24), 69.0% (40/58), and 50.8% (33/65), respectively. These results suggest widespread exposure to Cache Valley virus or closely related viruses in domestic animals and mule deer in Saskatchewan."
0,"Invasive bacterial and fungal infections in paediatric patients with cancer: incidence, risk factors, aetiology and outcomes in a UK regional cohort 2009-2011.","Cancer is the second most common cause of childhood deaths in the United Kingdom and infection contributes to a quarter of all cancer-related deaths. This study aimed to estimate the risk, aetiology and outcome of bloodstream bacterial and fungal infections in children with cancer within a geographically defined region in South-West London over a 3-year period.Web-based questionnaires were completed using case records of children with positive blood cultures admitted to five London hospitals during 2009-2011.A total of 112 children with a median age of 5.4 (IQR 3.6-11.2) years had 266 significant blood cultures during 149 infection episodes. Haematological malignancy affected 68 patients (60.7%) and solid tumours 44 (39.3%). The overall bloodstream infection rate was 1.5 episodes per 1,000 days-at-risk (95% CI, 1.2-1.8) and was similar for those with haematological malignancies and solid tumours. Most episodes were attributed to central venous catheter infection (120/149, 80.5%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated in almost half the bloodstream infections (127/266; 47.7%), while Gram-negative organisms accounted for a further quarter (64/266; 24.1%). Fungal isolates from blood were uncommon (8/112 children, 7.1%) but significantly associated with neutropenia (18/149 [12.1%] vs. 1/114 [0.9%], P = 0.0004). Six children (5.4%) died, including three (2.7%; 95% CI, 0.6-7.6%) whose deaths were infection-related.This study provides an updated risk estimate for bloodstream infections in children with cancer and adds to the framework for developing evidence-based guidance for management of suspected infections in this highly vulnerable group."
0,Management of bacterial and fungal infections in end stage liver disease and liver transplantation: Current options and future directions.,"Patients with liver cirrhosis are susceptible to infections due to various mechanisms, including abnormalities of humoral and cell-mediated immunity and occurrence of bacterial translocation from the intestine. Bacterial infections are common and represent a reason for progression to liver failure and increased mortality. Fungal infections, mainly caused by <i>Candida</i> spp., are often associated to delayed diagnosis and high mortality rates. High level of suspicion along with prompt diagnosis and treatment of infections are warranted. Bacterial and fungal infections negatively affect the outcomes of liver transplant candidates and recipients, causing disease progression among patients on the waiting list and increasing mortality, especially in the early post-transplant period. Abdominal, biliary tract, and bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria [<i>e.g</i>., <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>)] and <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp. are commonly encountered in liver transplant recipients. Due to frequent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, invasive procedures, and prolonged hospitalizations, these patients are especially at risk of developing infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria. The increase in antimicrobial resistance hampers the choice of an adequate empiric therapy and warrants the knowledge of the local microbial epidemiology and the implementation of infection control measures. The main characteristics and the management of bacterial and fungal infections in patients with liver cirrhosis and liver transplant recipients are presented."
0,"Bacterial and fungal infections in acute-on-chronic liver failure: prevalence, characteristics and impact on prognosis.","Bacterial infection is a frequent trigger of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), syndrome that could also increase the risk of infection. This investigation evaluated prevalence and characteristics of bacterial and fungal infections causing and complicating ACLF, predictors of follow-up bacterial infections and impact of bacterial infections on survival.407 patients with ACLF and 235 patients with acute decompensation (AD).152 patients (37%) presented bacterial infections at ACLF diagnosis; 46%(n=117) of the remaining 255 patients with ACLF developed bacterial infections during follow-up (4 weeks). The corresponding figures in patients with AD were 25% and 18% (p<0.001). Severe infections (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pneumonia, severe sepsis/shock, nosocomial infections and infections caused by multiresistant organisms) were more prevalent in patients with ACLF. Patients with ACLF and bacterial infections (either at diagnosis or during follow-up) showed higher grade of systemic inflammation at diagnosis of the syndrome, worse clinical course (ACLF 2-3 at final assessment: 47% vs 26%; p<0.001) and lower 90-day probability of survival (49% vs 72.5%;p<0.001) than patients with ACLF without infection. Bacterial infections were independently associated with mortality in patients with ACLF-1 and ACLF-2. Fungal infections developed in 9 patients with ACLF (2%) and in none with AD, occurred mainly after ACLF diagnosis (78%) and had high 90-day mortality (71%).Bacterial infections are extremely frequent in ACLF. They are severe and associated with intense systemic inflammation, poor clinical course and high mortality. Patients with ACLF are highly predisposed to develop bacterial infections within a short follow-up period and could benefit from prophylactic strategies."
0,Use of (1???3)-??-d-glucan for diagnosis and management of invasive mycoses in HIV-infected patients.,"People living with HIV (PLHIV) are highly vulnerable to invasive fungal infections (IFIs) due to their immune dysfunction. Diagnosis and treatment of IFIs remain challenging due to the requirement of deep tissue sampling to visualise and culture fungi before initiating treatment. Such techniques are less practical in resource-limited settings due to their cost and requirement of relatively invasive procedures. Hence, identification of surrogate markers for the early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of IFIs is required. Recent studies have shown that (1???3)-??-d-glucan (BDG), a major fungal cell wall antigen, represents a promising soluble marker for the presumptive diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of IFIs in HIV-infected patients. Herein, we review findings on the merits of BDG assays in the diagnosis of IFIs and monitoring of antifungal therapies for PLHIV. Conversely to other types of immunocompromised patients, HIV infection is associated with gut damage and subsequent bacterial and fungal translocation leading to elevated BDG plasma levels."
0,Impact of a change in protected environment on the occurrence of severe bacterial and fungal infections in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is a procedure with a high infection risk. Strict isolation of patients is the rule to prevent such condition.We compared the occurrence of severe infections (bacteremia and invasive fungal infection, IFI) in children undergoing alloHSCT before and after the move to a new protected unit with decreases in isolation methods.The study was conducted over a 10-year period. Unit 1 (2002-2007) consisted of laminar airflow rooms where caregivers were required to wear a sterile outfit (gown, gloves, hat, and mask). Unit 2 (2008-2012) included spacious positive air pressure rooms with HEPA filters where only a clean gown and mask were required to be worn.Two hundred eighty-six alloHSCTs were performed (144 in Unit 1 and 142 in Unit 2). We reported a total incidence of 4.78 infections/1000 hospital-days including 4.4 episodes of bacteremia and 0.38 episodes of IFI. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of infections: n??=??4.98/1000 hospital-days in Unit 1 vs. n??=??4.6/1000 in Unit 2 (P??=??0.63).The lack of difference in the occurrence of severe infection supports our decision to decrease unnecessary high protection in alloHSCT units to improve children's daily life."
0,Relationship between death and infections among patients hospitalized in internal medicine departments: a prevalence and validation study.,"We assessed the burden of infection-related death at internal medicine departments in Denmark and the validity of 2 population-based registries for diagnoses of infection.We reviewed medical records of all inpatients who died at a large university hospital during 2008 with an infection diagnosis in the Cause of Death Registry (CDR) or Hospital Discharge Registry (HDR). We computed the positive predictive value of infection diagnoses and completeness of each registry with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the prevalence of infection-related deaths by capture-recapture analysis.Among 458 deaths, 193 patients (42.1%) had an infection diagnosis of which 40.0% (183 out of 458) were verified. The positive predictive value of an infection diagnosis was 96.0% (95% CI, 92.0%-98.3%) in the CDR and 95.3% (CI, 90.9%-97.9%) in the HDR. Completeness of the CDR was 79.2% (CI, 72.9%-84.6%) and completeness of the HDR was 77.0% (CI, 70.6%-82.7%). By capture-recapture analysis we estimated that 43.2% of all deaths (198 out of 458) were related to infection.The large proportion of deaths in internal medicine departments that are related to infection emphasizes the need for optimized infection prevention and treatment strategies. CDR and HDR are valid sources for identifying infection and may supplement each other for increased completeness of infection-related death in epidemiologic research."
0,Bacterial and fungal infections in the early post-transplant period after kidney transplantation: etiological agents and their susceptibility.,"Infections remain serious complications in solid-organ transplant recipients, despite professional medical care, the introduction of new immunosuppressive drugs, and treatment that decreases the risk of infections.The study covered 295 adult patients undergoing kidney transplantation (KTx) between September 2001 and December 2007. All the patients were followed prospectively for infections from the KTx date and during the first 4 weeks after surgery. Samples of clinical materials were investigated for microbiological cultures. The microorganisms were cultured and identified in accordance with standard bacteriological procedures. Susceptibility testing was carried out through the use of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute procedures.From 295 KTx recipients, 1073 clinical samples were taken for microbiological examination. Positive cultures were 26.9% (n = 289) of all samples tested; 525 strains were collected. Gram-positive bacteria were isolated in 52.2% (n = 274), Gram-negative bacteria were isolated in 40.8% (n = 214), and fungal strains were isolated in 7% (n = 37). Urine specimens (n = 582) were obtained from 84.5% of 245 recipients during the first month after transplantation. Among the isolated bacterial strains (n = 291), the most common were Gram-negative bacteria (56.4%). Gram-positive bacteria comprised 35.7%; fungal strains were found in 23 cases (7.9%). In surgical site specimens (n = 309), Gram-positive bacteria (72.1%) were the most common. Gram-negative bacteria comprised 24.4%. In blood specimens (n = 138), Gram-positive bacteria (81.6%) were the most common. Gram-negative bacteria comprised 15.8%; fungi were isolated in 2.6%. In respiratory tract specimens (n = 13), among the isolated bacterial strains (n = 8), the most common were Gram-positive bacteria (57.1%). Gram-negative bacteria comprised 14.3%; fungi were isolated in 28.6%.Urine samples were predominantly positive after KTx. Our study showed Gram-positive bacteria in 52.2% after kidney transplantation. The proportion of isolates of multi-drug-resistant bacterial strains (MRCNS, vancomycin-resistant strains, high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains) was increased. These data indicate the need for strict adherence to infection control procedures in these patients."
0,Impact of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacterial and Fungal Infections in Outcome of Acute Pancreatitis.,"The knowledge about pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns is essential to select an appropriate antibiotic.We investigated the microbiological profile in pancreatic and extrapancreatic infections, and antibiotic sensitivity pattern in patients with acute pancreatitis.Of 556 patients with acute pancreatitis, only 189 developed bacterial infection; however, bacteremia was present in 42 patients (7.6%). Culture-proven infected pancreatic necrotic collection was present in 161 patients (29%). Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common organisms. Among the bacterial infection cohort, 164 patients developed multidrug-resistant bacterial infection. Infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially at multiple sites, increased mortality. Nearly 50% of patients (n = 94) acquired extremely drug-resistant bacterial infection at some time and emerged as key reason for prolonged hospital and intensive care unit stay. Colistin resistance and tigecycline resistance were documented in 2.1% and 17.2% of the specimens at admission and in 4.6% and 21% of specimens during the hospital stay. Of 556 patients, 102 patients developed fungal infection and 28 patients had only fungal infection without bacterial infection.Colistin and tigecycline are best reserved as last-resort antibiotics. Fungal infection was found to be associated with increased mortality, median hospital stay, and intensive care unit stay."
0,Systemic inflammatory markers and aspiration cell count may not differentiate bacterial from fungal prosthetic infections.,"Fungal periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are rare. Fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the literature. The characteristics of systemic inflammatory markers and joint aspirate cell count analysis obtained in patients with fungal PJIs have not been fully assessed. The ability to diagnose involvement of fungal PJI preoperatively may optimize the surgical and medical management of these patients.We determined whether preoperative systemic inflammatory markers and total synovial fluid leukocyte count and neutrophil percentage were different between patients with fungal and bacterial PJI.We reviewed the medical records of 44 patients with culture-positive diagnosed fungal PJIs treated at our institution between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2011, in this study. This represented 1.2% of the total 3822 PJIs treated at our institution during the study period. The mean values for C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocyte count, and neutrophil percentage of patients with purely fungal PJIs were compared to those of 59 patients with bacterial PJIs treated by one surgeon during the same time period.The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate values for fungal and bacterial PJIs were 40 mm/hour (95% CI: 30, 50 mm/hour) and 41 mm/hour (95% CI: 33, 49 mm/hour), respectively (p=0.61). The mean C-reactive protein values for fungal and bacterial PJIs were 42 mg/L (95% CI: 22, 62 mg/L) and 65 mg/L (95% CI: 43, 88 mg/L), respectively (p=0.42). The mean total nucleated leukocyte counts for fungal and bacterial PJIs were 11,928 (95% CI: 3906, 19,950) with 81% (95% CI: 75%, 88%) neutrophils and 36,901 (95% CI: 21,822, 51,921) with 73% (95% CI: 65%, 81%) neutrophils, respectively (leukocyte count: p=0.19; neutrophil percentage: p=0.55).Early detection of fungal PJI is needed, but systemic inflammatory markers and synovial fluid cell count analyses from aspirations do not discriminate whether an infection may be of fungal origin.Level IV, diagnostic study. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence."
0,[Frequency of invasive fungal infections in a Mexican High-Specialty Hospital. Experience of 21 years].,"Factors such as cancer, HIV infection, use of corticosteroids and antibiotics, favors the increase in the number of invasive fungal infections (IFI) worldwide.To determine the frequency and epidemiological aspects of IFI at a mexican, a review of the proven cases diagnosed over the past 21 years (1993-2013) in the Laboratory of Medical Mycology was performed.A total of 472 cases were identified as: 261 candidiasis, 82 mucormycosis, 60 cryptococcosis, 43 aspergillosis and 16 histoplasmosis. A decrease in the frequency of candidiasis was observed, with 74 cases in the first 6 years and 48 in the last five. C. albicans was the most common agent and pulmonary infection the most prevalent. Cryptococcosis also declined from 24 to 10 cases, mainly caused by C. neoformans; two cases of C. laurentii and C. terreus and C unigutulatus were isolated once. Mucormycosis remained steady, but aspergillosis increased significantly, and from 2 cases found in the first studied period, it rose to 23 in the last one.It is important that High Specialty Hospitals have well-equipped laboratories of Medical Mycology. We suggest the creation of a National Reference Center for Mycoses to collect all the data of these infections, in order to help to the development of strategies for health education, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of them."
0,[Epidemiology of Visceral Mycoses in Autopsy Cases in 2011].,"To identify recent trends in the frequency of mycoses in autopsy cases, we performed an epidemiological analysis using the data reported in the ""Annual Report of Autopsy Cases in Japan"" from 2011. 12,339 cases were autopsied, of which 608 (4.9 %) were found to have fungal infections. Of these, 411 cases (67.6 %) were male, the median age was 67, and 353 cases were severe (58.1 %). Aspergillus spp. was the most predominant causative agent among those infected with one pathogen. These data corroborate our previous data from reports in 2007 and 2009. For the first time since 1989, we observed a case of mycoses caused by Exophiala spp. with adult T cell leukemia and lymphoma. The types of underlying disease were also typical of that in our previous analysis in 2009. These included solid cancers in 124 cases (20.4 %), leukemia in 83 cases (13.7 %), bacterial infections such as pneumonia 69 cases (11.3 %) and malignant lymphoma in 66 cases (10.9 %). In 2011, the number of mycoses following solid organ transplantation totaled 12 cases and was the most numerous since 2005. A limitation of this study may be that the epidemiology of autopsied cases includes the more severe end of the fungal infection spectrum, and selection bias could not be ruled out. Nonetheless, this epidemiological analysis of autopsied cases with fungal infection provides a strong incentive to intensify and improve efforts in diagnosing and treating visceral mycosis. "
0,Impact of the microbial derived short chain fatty acid propionate on host susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections in vivo.,"Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by intestinal microbes mediate anti-inflammatory effects, but whether they impact on antimicrobial host defenses remains largely unknown. This is of particular concern in light of the attractiveness of developing SCFA-mediated therapies and considering that SCFAs work as inhibitors of histone deacetylases which are known to interfere with host defenses. Here we show that propionate, one of the main SCFAs, dampens the response of innate immune cells to microbial stimulation, inhibiting cytokine and NO production by mouse or human monocytes/macrophages, splenocytes, whole blood and, less efficiently, dendritic cells. In proof of concept studies, propionate neither improved nor worsened morbidity and mortality parameters in models of endotoxemia and infections induced by gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Candida albicans. Moreover, propionate did not impair the efficacy of passive immunization and natural immunization. Therefore, propionate has no significant impact on host susceptibility to infections and the establishment of protective anti-bacterial responses. These data support the safety of propionate-based therapies, either via direct supplementation or via the diet/microbiota, to treat non-infectious inflammation-related disorders, without increasing the risk of infection."
0,Epidemiology of bacterial infections in patients with liver cirrhosis. Experience in a Spanish tertiary health center.,"Bacterial infections represent a serious complication of liver cirrhosis. Traditionally,??Gram negative bacteria have been described as the microorganisms responsible for the majority of??the infections. However, in the past few years, changes in the microbiological spectrum have been??described, and multiresistant bacteria are observed more frequently.??To assess the proportion of patients with infections caused by multiresistant bacteria admitted??to our hospital, and to obtain information about their epidemiology, risk factors and clinical impact.??We performed a retrospective evaluation of 294 cirrhotic patients admitted to??our unit due to infection between June, 2011, and June, 2013.??We isolated 310 microorganisms from 294 patients; 109 (35.2%) were Gram positive, 167??(53.9%), Gram negative, and 34, fungi (11%). As for the microbiological agents, the most frequent was??Escherichia coli (98 isolations). The infection was community-acquired in 22.9% of cases, healthcareassociated??in 38.1% and nosocomial in 39%. Worse liver infections and septic shock were more frequent among patients with multiresistant isolates (p=0.05); and intrahospital mortality was also higher among??them (p=0.017). Previous hospital admission, antibiotic treatment 60 days before, nosocomial or??healthcare-associated acquisition and bacterial isolation in control cultures were identified as possible??risk factors for the development of multiresistant infection.??The results of our study confirm that important changes have ocurred in the microbiological??spectrum of bacterial infections in patients with liver cirrhosis. Multiresistant bacteria are associated??with high morbidity and mortality, as well as failure of traditional antibiotic treatment. Successfull control??of the infection requires an early identification of patients at risk."
0,Spontaneous bacterial and fungal infections in genetically engineered mice: Is Escherichia coli an emerging pathogen in laboratory mouse?,"The impact of particular microbes on genetically engineered mice depends on the genotype and the environment. Infections resulting in clinical disease have an obvious impact on animal welfare and experimentation. In this study, we investigated the bacterial and fungal aetiology of spontaneous clinical disease of infectious origin among the genetically engineered mice from our institution in relation to their genotype. A total of 63 mice belonging to 33 different mice strains, from severe immunodeficient to wild-type, were found to display infections as the primary cause leading to their euthanasia. The necropsies revealed abscesses localized subcutaneously as well as in the kidney, preputial glands, seminal vesicles, in the uterus, umbilicus or in the lung. In addition, pneumonia, endometritis and septicaemia cases were recorded. Escherichia coli was involved in 21 of 44 (47.72%) of the lesions of bacterial origin, whereas [Pasteurella] pneumotropica was isolated from 19 of 44 (43.18%) cases. The infections with the two agents mentioned above included three cases of mixed infection with both pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus was considered responsible for five of 44 (11.36%) cases whereas Enterobacter cloacae was found to cause lesions in two of 44 (4.54%) mice. Overall, 16 of the 44 (36.36%) cases of bacterial aetiology affected genetically engineered mice without any explicit immunodeficiency or wild-type strains. The remaining 19 cases of interstitial pneumonia were caused by Pneumocystis murina. In conclusion, the susceptibility of genetically modified mice to opportunistic infections has to be regarded with precaution, regardless of the type of genetic modification performed. Beside the classical opportunists, such as [Pasteurella] pneumotropica and Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli should as well be closely monitored to evaluate whether it represents an emerging pathogen in the laboratory mouse."
0,Incidence and risk factors of bacterial and fungal infection during induction chemotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma.,"High-risk neuroblastoma is an aggressive childhood cancer with poor outcomes. Treatment begins with an induction phase comprised of intense multi-agent chemotherapy with the goal of maximally reducing tumor bulk. Given the high intensity of induction chemotherapy, neutropenic fever and infectious complications are common; however, the actual incidence is difficult to determine from clinical trial reports. We performed a retrospective review of infection-related complications in 76 children treated for high-risk neuroblastoma at Texas Children's Hospital. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, febrile neutropenia (FN) episodes, presence, and type of bacterial and fungal infections, and potential risk factors for infection. Fifty-seven percent of patients developed one or more serious bacterial or fungal infections during induction chemotherapy. Additionally, over 75% of patients had at least one admission for FN. Risk factors for developing any infection included female sex, MYCN amplification, and having Medicaid. Patients with external central venous catheters and those requiring parenteral nutrition had higher rates of bacteremia or fungemia. Each cycle, 50% were readmitted for either FN or infection. The overall burden of infectious complications was high, with 70% having two or more unplanned admissions for infection or FN. The incidence of febrile neutropenia and serious bacterial and fungal infections during induction chemotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma is high. Most patients had at least two additional hospitalizations for infectious complications. Risk factors including female sex, MYCN amplification, payer status, and type of central access were associated with higher rates of infection in this cohort.CLABSI Central line associated blood stream infection; CTCAE Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; FN Febrile neutropenia; ANC Absolute neutrophil count; TPN Total parenteral nutrition."
0,Health Threats from Contamination of Spices Commercialized in Romania: Risks of Fungal and Bacterial Infections.,"The study of fungal contamination in food and mycotoxicoses is a priority today, both internationally and nationally. The purpose of this study is to have a general view over the quality of the most common spices that are sold in Romanian markets, by assessing the degree of fungal, bacterial and mycotoxin contamination in pepper and chili powders.We tested four types of spices: white pepper, black pepper, sweet and hot chili powders from 12 different distributing companies, summing a total of 35 sample types. The fungal and bacterial load was assessed by Standard Plate Count, while the mycotoxin content by High-performance liquid chromatography. Environmental conditions (humidity, pH) and the selling price for each product were also followed.Fungi were observed in 72.7% of black pepper samples, 33.3% in white pepper, 30% in sweet chili and 25% in hot chili products. The most common isolated fungus was Aspergillus spp., while Rhizopus, Mucor, Fusarium, Penicillium, Absidia species were found, in smaller percentage. Four producers (44.4%) presented fungal contamination of over 10^3 CFU/g and two producers (22.2%) presented no fungal contamination in their products. Bacterial contamination was found in 85.7% of the tested products, consisting mostly in Bacillus spp. Aflatoxin B1 was present in all the tested products, mostly in black pepper (mean value 126.3 ng/g); Ochratoxin A was present in sweet chili (mean value 328 ng/g) and Zearalenone in hot chili (mean value 604 ng/g) and sweet chili (mean value 382 ng/g).All spices presented either fungal contamination, mycotoxin contamination, or both. The high humidity and the high pH of spices represent favorable conditions for fungal growth. The selling price was partly related to the physic-chemical conditions and microbiological quality of the spices."
0,Topical antifungal-corticosteroid combination therapy for the treatment of superficial mycoses: conclusions of an expert panel meeting.,"Superficial fungal infections affect 20-25% of people worldwide and can cause considerable morbidity, particularly if an inflammatory component is present. As superficial fungal infections can be diverse, the treatment should be tailored to the individual needs of the patient and several factors should be taken into account when deciding on the most appropriate treatment option. These include the type, location and surface area of the infection, patient age, degree of inflammation and underlying comorbidities. Although several meta-analyses have shown that there are no significant differences between the numerous available topical antifungal agents with regard to mycological cure, agents differ in their specific intrinsic properties, which can affect their clinical use. The addition of a corticosteroid to an antifungal agent at the initiation of treatment can attenuate the inflammatory symptoms of the infection and is thought to increase patient compliance, reduce the risk of bacterial superinfection and enhance the efficacy of the antifungal agent. However, incorrect use of antifungal-corticosteroid therapy may be associated with treatment failure and adverse effects. This review summarises available treatment options for superficial fungal infections and provides general treatment recommendations based on the consensus outcomes of an Expert Panel meeting on the topical treatment of superficial mycoses.

0,Single-donor granulocyte transfusions for improving the outcome of high-risk pediatric patients with known bacterial and fungal infections undergoing stem cell transplantation: a 10-year single-center experience.,"Bacterial and fungal infections remain a significant cause of transplant-related mortality following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Granulocyte transfusions (GTs) may reduce the neutropenic period after SCT and prevent further progression of the existing infection (that is, therapeutic GT) in addition to standard antibacterial and antifungal therapy. A retrospective analysis was performed on 28 consecutive pediatric SCT recipients who received at least one dose of GT between March 2003 and November 2013 at a single institution. All donors were conditioned with G-CSF+dexamethasone with harvest performed 12-18?€?h later. Indications for SCT were acute leukemia in 46% (13/28) and severe aplastic anemia in 21% (6/28). The main indications for GT were invasive fungal disease in 50%, bacterial infection in 21% and co-morbidities with predicted reduced tolerance to sepsis in 18% (5/28). The median number of GT was 6 (range 1-14) with a median dose of 3.56 ?? 10(10) granulocytes infused. The median increment in ANC was 1.06 ?? 10(9)/L and correlated with the granulocyte dose infused. Adverse reactions observed were mild and infrequent. Sixty-four percent of patients (18/28) are alive with only 2 of the 10 deaths being related to progression of infection. In addition there was a low overall incidence of grade 3-4 acute mucositis and a very low incidence (7%) of acute GvHD grade 3-4. Single-donor GTs afford protection to children undergoing SCT at additional risk of infection and may reduce the overall incidence of severe GvHD. "
0,Massive Effect on LncRNAs in Human Monocytes During Fungal and Bacterial Infections and in Response to Vitamins A and D.,"Mycoses induced by C.albicans or A.fumigatus can cause important host damage either by deficient or exaggerated immune response. Regulation of chemokine and cytokine signaling plays a crucial role for an adequate inflammation, which can be modulated by vitamins A and D. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as transcription factors or cis-acting antisense RNAs are known to be involved in gene regulation. However, the processes during fungal infections and treatment with vitamins in terms of therapeutic impact are unknown. We show that in monocytes both vitamins regulate ncRNAs involved in amino acid metabolism and immune system processes using comprehensive RNA-Seq analyses. Compared to protein-coding genes, fungi and bacteria induced an expression change in relatively few ncRNAs, but with massive fold changes of up to 4000. We defined the landscape of long-ncRNAs (lncRNAs) in response to pathogens and observed variation in the isoforms composition for several lncRNA following infection and vitamin treatment. Most of the involved antisense RNAs are regulated and positively correlated with their sense protein-coding genes. We investigated lncRNAs with stimulus specific immunomodulatory activity as potential marker genes: LINC00595, SBF2-AS1 (A.fumigatus) and RP11-588G21.2, RP11-394l13.1 (C.albicans) might be detectable in the early phase of infection and serve as therapeutic targets in the future."
0,Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial and fungal infections among infected diabetic patients.,"To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the most common bacterial and fungal infections among infected diabetic patients.This study was conducted at the Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia, from June 2011 to June 2012, and comprised specimens collected from diabetics. Antibiotic susceptibility test using disc diffusion method was performed for bacterial isolates, and antifungal susceptibility test using colorimetric method for candida isolates.Of the 138 specimens, antibacterial susceptibility test was performed for 129(93.5%) bacterial isolates while antifungal resistance test was performed for 9(6.5%) candida isolates. Of the bacterial isolates, 27(20.9%) were escherichia coli, 26(20.1%) staphylococcus aureus and 15(11.6%) were pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. All Escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to amikacin and vancomycin (100% each). Moreover, all candida species were susceptible to amphotericin B, econazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole and nystatin (100% each).The most effective antibiotics for bacterial infections among diabetic patients were vancomycin for gram-positive bacteria, amikacin for gram-negative bacteria and for bacteria isolated from diabetic patients with foot infections."
0,Oral mycoses in avian scavengers exposed to antibiotics from livestock farming.,"The exposure to antimicrobial pharmaceuticals as environmental contaminants can exert direct and indirect detrimental effects on health of wildlife. Fungal infections pose a major threat to domestic, captive-housed wild and free-ranging wild animals worldwide. However, little is known about their role in disease in birds in the wild. Here, we evaluated the incidence of thrush-like lesions in the oral cavity of wild nestling cinereous vultures (Aegypius monachus), griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus), Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) exposed to veterinary antibiotics via the consumption of medicated livestock carcasses. Lesions, which varied in number, size and location, were more frequent in the cinereous (77.8%, n=9) and griffon vultures (66.7%, n=48) than in the Egyptian vultures (28.6%, n=21) and golden eagles (28.6%, n=7). In all individuals (100%, n=24) of a subsample of the affected nestlings, yeast species were isolated from thrush-like oral lesions and identified using a well-established system based on their carbohydrate assimilation profiles and other complementary tests. Fourteen yeast species from seven genera (Candida, Meyerozyma, Pichia, Yarrowia, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula and Trichosporon) were isolated from the lesions of the four host species. We found differential infections and effects depending on host age-related exposure or susceptibility to different yeast species across the development of nestling griffon vultures. This unprecedented outbreak of oral mycoses is alarming because of the delicate conservation status of several of the affected species. The role of livestock antibiotics in the transition of yeast species from commensal to opportunistic pathogens should be evaluated in an attempt to avoid the detrimental effects of contamination and disease on host health, as well as on the transmission of fungal emerging pathogens among wildlife populations and species, and their dissemination across livestock and human populations."
0,"Polymicrobial bacterial or fungal infections: incidence, spectrum of infection, risk factors, and clinical outcomes from a large hematopoietic stem cell transplant center.","Infections cause significant morbidity and mortality for patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Cancer patients who develop polymicrobial infection (PI) are at increased risk for poor clinical outcomes, yet very limited data have been published within the HSCT setting.An observational study of 901 stem cell transplant recipients was conducted at Northwestern Memorial Hospital to identify the incidence, risk factors and outcomes for HSCT recipients who develop infection(s) with multiple bacterial or fungal organisms.Among 901 HSCT recipients reviewed (675 autografts and 226 allografts), 237 patients (27%) had microbiologically documented microorganisms isolated, including 179 patients (76%) with monomicrobial infection and 59 patients (24%) with multiple microorganisms, of which 34 (14%) were classified as PI, and 25 (10%) as multiple distinct episodes of infection.The results show co-infection with multiple organisms during HSCT is relatively rare; however, these patients are at an increased risk for the development of acute graft-versus-host disease, delayed engraftment, and overall mortality."
0,Infections in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease constitute a population with a special predisposition to develop bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Iatrogenic immunosuppression, frequent contact with healthcare facilities and surgical interventions are some of the risk factors that explain why these infections are one of the main causes of morbi-mortality in this disease. Some of these infections follow a subtle and paucisymptomatic evolution; their diagnosis and management may become a real challenge for the attending physician if their screening is not systematized or they are not considered in the differential diagnosis. The objective of this review is to provide an update from a practical and concise perspective on the knowledge regarding the epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the most common infections."

We sought to retrospectively analyze the epidemiology and risk factors for bacterial, fungal, and viral infections in children after allogeneic HSCT in a cohort of 759 children who underwent allogeneic HSCT in a single institution between 1990 and 2009. The association between infections and risk factors of interest at 0 to 30 days, 31 to 100 days, and 101 days to 2 years posttransplantation was evaluated using logistic regression. Difference among the subtypes within each category was studied. There were 243 matched-related donors, 239 matched-unrelated donors (MUDs), and 176 haploidentical donor transplantations. Era of transplantation (0-30 days), peripheral blood stem cell product, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD; 31-100 days), and chronic GVHD (cGVHD; 101-730 days) were associated with higher risk for bacterial infections at the respective time periods. Patients with aGVHD (31-100 days), cGVHD, and older age (101-730 days) were at higher risk for fungal infections. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) donor/recipient (D/R) serostatus (0-100 days), era of transplantation, MUD HSCT (31-100 days), and cGVHD (101-730 days), influenced viral infections. Gram-positive outnumbered gram-negative bacterial infections; aspergillosis and candidemia were equally prevalent in all time periods. Haploidentical donor HSCT was not associated with an increased risk of infections. There seems to be a continuum in the timeline of infections posttransplantation, with bacterial, fungal, and viral infections prevalent in all time periods, particularly late after the transplantation, the risk affected by GVHD, CMV, D/R status, product type, older age, and use of unrelated donors."
0,Diagnosis and treatment of nonadjacent cryptococcal infections at the L1 and S1 vertebrae.,"Cryptococcal spine infections are rare infections that are easy to misdiagnose and difficult to cure. Therefore, we report the case of a??25-year-old man who presented with nonspecific spinal lesions at L1 and S1. The patient underwent surgical removal of the lesions, and specimens were submitted for microbial identification, which identified a??cryptococcal infection that was susceptible to amphotericin??B. The patient exhibited marked improvement after receiving intravenous amphotericin??B and remained asymptomatic (no back pain, fever, or other symptoms) at the 3?€? and 9?€?month follow-ups. Similar cases of cryptococcal spine infections are rare, and we believe that our diagnostic findings and treatment experience may help improve the management of this rare disease."
0,Food safety in scavenger conservation: Diet-associated exposure to livestock pharmaceuticals and opportunist mycoses in threatened Cinereous and Egyptian vultures.,"Pharmaceuticals from veterinary treatments may enter terrestrial food webs when medicated livestock are available to wildlife in supplementary feeding stations aimed at the conservation of endangered scavengers. Here, we hypothesized that the exposure risk to livestock fluoroquinolones, as indicators of pharmaceutical burden in food, is related to the variable reliance of scavengers on domestic versus wild animal carcasses. Since the misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major predisposing factor for opportunistic mycoses, we evaluated disease signs potentially associated with diet-dependent drug exposure in nestlings of two threatened vultures. A greater occurrence (100%, n=14) and concentration of fluoroquinolones (mean??SD=73.0??27.5??gL<sup>-1</sup>, range=33.2-132.7), mostly enrofloxacin, were found in Cinereous vultures, Aegypius monachus, due to their greater dependence on livestock carcasses than Egyptian vultures, Neophron percnopterus (fluoroquinolones occurrence: 44%, n=16, concentration: 37.9??16.6??gL<sup>-1</sup>, range=11.5-55.9), which rely much more on carcasses of wild animals (42% of remains vs. 23% in the cinereous vulture). The chaotic, chronic and pulsed ingestion of these drugs throughout nestling development is proposed as one of the most plausible explanations for the high occurrence and intensity of oral Candida-like lesions in nestling vultures. The high occurrence of fluoroquinolone residues and disease hindered the probing of a cause-effect relationship between both factors in individual vultures. This relationship could be evaluated through a population-based approach by sampling vultures not exposed to these drugs. The high dependence of vultures on domestic animals today compared to past decades and the growing intensification of livestock farming, imply an expected increase in the impact of pharmaceuticals on scavenger populations. This requires further evaluation due to potential consequences in biodiversity conservation and environmental health. We encourage the prioritization of efforts to promote the use of less medicated free-ranging livestock carcasses left in the countryside, rather than stabled stocks made available in vulture restaurants. Additionally, attention should be paid to the population recovery of wild species that dominated scavenger diets in the past."
0,Genetic polymorphisms in innate immunity receptors do not predict the risk of bacterial and fungal infections and acute rejection after liver transplantation.,"We studied the influence of a broad range of genetic variants in recipient and donor innate immunity receptors on bacterial and fungal infections and acute rejection after liver transplantation (LT).Seventy-six polymorphisms in TLR 1-10, NOD2, LBP, CD14, MD2, SIGIRR, Ficolins 1, -2, and -3, MASP 1, -2, and -3, and the complement receptor C1qR1 were determined in 188 LT recipients and 135 of their donors. Associations with clinically significant infections and acute rejection were analyzed for 50 polymorphisms. Significant associations were validated in an independent cohort of 181 recipients and 167 donors.Three recipient polymorphisms and 3 donor polymorphisms were associated with infections in the identification cohort, but none of these associations were confirmed in the validation cohort. Three donor polymorphisms were associated with acute rejection in the identification cohort, but not in the validation cohort.In contrast to their effect in the general population, 50 common genetic variations in innate immunity receptors do not influence susceptibility to bacterial/fungal infections after LT. In addition, no reproducible associations with acute rejection after LT were observed. Likely, transplant-related factors play a superior role as risk factors for bacterial/fungal infections and acute rejection after LT."
0,"A specific Toll-like receptor profile on T lymphocytes and values of monocytes correlate with bacterial, fungal, and cytomegalovirus infections in the early period of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","Bacterial, fungal, and viral infections often affect non-relapse mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Recovery from infections depends on a balanced integration between innate and adaptive immune responses. In this complex interplay, a key role is played by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are sensors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. To our knowledge, no previous study deals with both expression and function of all human TLRs together, in relation to infections in the setting of alloSCT.We prospectively evaluated 9 TLRs by flow cytometry on T lymphocytes and monocytes of 35 patients in relation to infectious events from day +30 to day +120. Tumor necrois factor-alpha, interleukin-4, interferon-gamma, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 induction upon TLR activation was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on cell supernatants.In multivariate Cox regression analysis, levels of TLR-9 expression on T lymphocytes (P = 0.01) and values of natural killer cells (P = 0.01) correlated negatively with bacterial infections, whereas cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection resulted as a positive predictor. We observed a trend for negative correlation between TLR-7 levels on T lymphocytes and fungal infections (P = 0.07). Values of monocytes were negatively associated with CMV infection (P = 0.03), whereas levels of TLR-5 on T lymphocytes were positive predictors (P = 0.01). Age (P = 0.03) and bacterial infections (P = 0.006) negatively influenced overall survival. Monocyte values were positive predictors of survival (P = 0.003).Bacterial, fungal, and CMV infections were associated with a different expression of some TLRs on T lymphocytes. The protective role of TLR-7 and TLR-9 seemed dominant over other TLRs involved in recognizing fungi and bacteria. We also observed an atypical involvement of TLR-5 in CMV infection. The dominant and atypical role of some TLRs could depend on their pleiotropic functions and the changing inflammatory environment of transplanted patients. A specific TLR profile and an adequate count of monocytes could improve survival, promoting an effective control of infections, and balanced immune responses. If our findings will be confirmed by further studies, these immunological variables could be useful as parameters to predict susceptibility to infections."
0,Increased risk of infections and infection-related mortality in children undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation compared to conventional anticancer therapy: a multicentre nationwide study.,"This nationwide multicentre study analysed the epidemiology of bacterial, viral and fungal infections in paediatric haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and paediatric haematology and oncology (PHO) patients over a period of 24 consecutive months, including incidence, hazard risk and outcome of infections as well as occurrence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. During this period, 308 HSCTs were performed and 1768 children were newly diagnosed for malignancy. Compared to PHO, the risk in HSCT patients was significantly higher for all infections (hazard ratio (HR) 2.7), bacterial (HR 1.4), fungal (HR 3.5) and viral (HR 15.7) infections. The risk was higher in allo- than auto-HSCT for bacterial (HR 1.4), fungal (HR 3.2) and viral (HR 17.7) infections. The incidence of resistant bacteria was higher in HSCT than in PHO patients for both G-negative (72.5% vs. 59.2%) and G-positive (41.4% vs. 20.5%) strains. Cumulative incidence of bacterial, fungal and viral infections in HSCT patients was 33.9, 22.8 and 38.3%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of viral infections in allo-HSCT was 28.0% for cytomegalovirus, 18.5% for BK virus, 15.5% for Epstein-Barr virus, 9.5% for adenovirus, 2.6% for varicella zoster virus, 0.9% for influenza, 0.9% for human herpesvirus 6 and 0.3% for hepatitis B virus. Survival rates from infections were lower in HSCT than in PHO patients in bacterial (96.0 vs. 98.2%), fungal (75.5 vs. 94.6%) and most viral infections. In conclusion, the risk of any infections and the occurrence of resistant bacterial strains in allo-HSCT patients were higher than in auto-HSCT and PHO patients, while the outcome of infections was better in the PHO setting."
0,Impact of an Institutional Antimicrobial Stewardship Program on Bacteriology of Surgical Site Infections in Cardiac Surgery.,"Surgical site infections (SSIs) occur in 1% to 4% of cardiac surgery patients and are associated with significantly reduced survival. The present study evaluated trends in the incidence and bacteriology of SSIs before and after the implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship program.Starting in 2010, our institution utilized a protocol that included daily chlorhexidine baths, and strict cessation of prophylactic antibiotics after 48?€?hours. We used our institutional Society of Thoracic Surgery Database to identify all adult patients who underwent cardiac operations. Data from the microbiology laboratory were used to identify SSIs. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery between January 2008 and December 2010 (pre-stewardship group: PRE) and January 2011 and December 2012 (post-stewardship group: POST) were compared.Of the 3233 patients who underwent cardiac surgery during the study period, 23 (0.71%) developed SSIs (PRE: 0.69%, POST: 0.75%, p?€?=?€?0.843). The proportion of gram positive, gram negative, fungal, and anaerobic organisms was not significantly different between time periods. The most commonly identified organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Despite changes in antibiotic prophylaxis duration and postoperative skin treatment, our data demonstrate a stable incidence and composition of surgical wound infections during the study period. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12756 (J Card Surg 2016;31:367-372)."
0,Bacterial and fungal infections in the early post-transplantation period after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation: etiological agents and their susceptibility.,"This study aims to evaluate the frequency of microbial isolates and their susceptibility profiles cultured from clinical samples obtained from 26 simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant (SPK) recipients suspected of infections during the early post-transplantation period.Data on microbiologic culture of 26 adult patients undergoing SPK were collected prospectively from 2001 to the end of 2006. Isolation and identification of cultured micro-organisms were performed according to standard microbiological procedures and commercially available tests. Susceptibility of the strains to antibacterial agents was made by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.All the patients were followed prospectively for the first 4 weeks after surgery. In total, 263 samples from clinical materials obtained from 26 SPK recipients were cultured. Bacterial cultures were positive in 29.3% (n = 77) clinical samples. Of these, 219 microbial strains were cultured. Gram-positive bacteria were found in 64% (n = 140), Gram-negative bacteria in 22.8% (n = 50), and fungal strains were isolated in 13.2% (n = 29). Incidence rate values for subsequent isolation of micro-organisms in the sub-periods of time for decreasing the SPK were Gram-positive bacteria (102.3-18.7; I versus IV), growing the Gram-negative bacteria (14-46.1 I versus III) IV were 14, decreasing to fungi (22.1-1.6, I versus IV). Until now this early post-transplantation period was considered homogeneous time after transplantation. This study shows that this period is actually heterogenous, with statistically significant differences being observed between results obtained in consecutive 4 weeks after transplantation.The results of this study show that the incidence rate was elevated with increasing age in the SPK group of patients. In the SPK group, our data showed the highest rate of isolation of micro-organisms compared with recipients of kidneys or liver."
0,"[Bacterial and fungal urinary tract infections: epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical management].","Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections and represent a significant problem both from an epidemiological and clinical point of view. Moreover, they place a substantial financial burden on society. UTIs can be asymptomatic or symptomatic and are characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild irritative voiding to bacteremia, sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. They may occur in a normal genitourinary tract with no prior instrumentation (uncomplicated infections) or in genitourinary tracts with structural or functional abnormalities, or in patients with specific risk factors (complicated infections). In the hospital setting bacterial and fungal UTIs are strongly related to the use and misuse of indwelling urinary catheters. Catheter-related UTIs increase morbidity, mortality and costs and constitute an efficient reservoir for multidrug-resistant bacteria."
0,"A practical guide to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of neonatal infections.","Neonatal infections continue to cause morbidity and mortality in infants. Among approximately 400,000 infants followed nationally, the incidence rates of early-onset sepsis infection within 3 days of life are 0.98 cases per 1000 live births. Newborn infants are at increased risk for infections because they have relative immunodeficiency. This article provides evidence-based practical approaches to the diagnosis, management, and prevention of neonatal infections. "
0,Pattern of bacterial and fungal infections in the first 3 months after pediatric living donor liver transplantation: an 11-year single-center experience.,"Infection after pediatric living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Here, we sought to determine the incidence, timing, location, and risk factors for bacterial and fungal infections. We retrospectively investigated infection for 3 postoperative months in 345 consecutive pediatric patients (56.2% were females) who underwent primary LDLT at Kyoto University Hospital, Japan. A total of 179 patients (51.9%) developed at least 1 bacterial and/or fungal infection episode, with an infection rate of 2.5 per patient. The predominant infection site was the surgical site (52%). Most of the bacterial and fungal infection occurred within the first month. Enterococcus species followed by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant bacterial pathogens. All fungal isolates were Candida species. Prolonged preoperative hospital stay more than 7 days (P = 0.025) and bile leak (P = 0.047) were independent predictors of bacterial infection. Preoperative ascites (P = 0.009) and prolonged insertion of intravascular catheters (P = 0.001) independently predicted fungal infections. Bacterial and fungal infections were responsible for 42.9% of the causes of death in our study. To avoid bacterial and fungal infections after LDLT, broader-spectrum prophylaxis to cover the range of organisms seen in these infections should be considered as a more favorable treatment regimen to prevent prophylaxis failure, especially for patients with a preoperative hospital stay more than 7 days or operative complications in the form of a bile leak. Early drain removal and prophylactic antifungal drugs should be considered for patients with preoperative ascites. Cooperation between attending physicians and infectious disease physicians can improve the outcome of patients after LDLT."
0,Transferrin-mediated iron sequestration as a novel therapy for bacterial and fungal infections.,"Pathogenic microbes must acquire essential nutrients, including iron, from the host in order to proliferate and cause infections. Iron sequestration is an ancient host antimicrobial strategy. Thus, enhancing iron sequestration is a promising, novel anti-infective strategy. Unfortunately, small molecule iron chelators have proven difficult to develop as anti-infective treatments, in part due to unacceptable toxicities. Iron sequestration in mammals is predominantly mediated by the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins. In this review, we explore the possibility of administering supraphysiological levels of exogenous transferrin as an iron sequestering therapy for infections, which could overcome some of the problems associated with small molecule chelation. Recent studies suggest that transferrin delivery may represent a promising approach to augment both natural resistance and traditional antibiotic therapy. "
0,Severe infections in critically ill solid organ transplant recipients.,"Severe infections are among the most common causes of death in immunocompromised patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of these infections has evolved in the last decade.We aim to provide a comprehensive review of these severe infections in this population.Review of the literature pertaining to severe infections in critically ill solid organ transplant recipients. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for documents published since database inception until November 2017.The epidemiology of severe infections has changed in the immunocompromised patients. This population is presenting to the intensive care unit with specific transplantation procedure-related infections, device-associated infections, a multitude of opportunistic viral infections, an increasing number of nosocomial infections and bacterial diseases with a more limited therapeutic armamentarium. Both molecular diagnostics and imaging techniques have had substantial progress in the last decade, which will, we hope, translate into faster and more precise diagnoses, as well as more optimal empirical treatment de-escalation.The key clinical elements to improve the outcome of critically ill solid organ transplant recipients depend on the knowledge of geographic epidemiology, specific surgical procedures, net state of immunosuppression, hospital microbial ecology, aggressive diagnostic strategy and search for source control, rapid initiation of antimicrobials and minimization of iatrogenic immunosuppression."
0,Sirtuin 3 deficiency does not alter host defenses against bacterial and fungal infections.,"Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is the main mitochondrial deacetylase. SIRT3 regulates cell metabolism and redox homeostasis, and protects from aging and age-associated pathologies. SIRT3 may drive both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects. SIRT3 deficiency has been reported to promote chronic inflammation-related disorders, but whether SIRT3 impacts on innate immune responses and host defenses against infections remains essentially unknown. This aspect is of primary importance considering the great interest in developing SIRT3-targeted therapies. Using SIRT3 knockout mice, we show that SIRT3 deficiency does not affect immune cell development and microbial ligand-induced proliferation and cytokine production by splenocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Going well along with these observations, SIRT3 deficiency has no major impact on cytokine production, bacterial burden and survival of mice subjected to endotoxemia, Escherichia coli peritonitis, Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, listeriosis and candidiasis of diverse severity. These data suggest that SIRT3 is not critical to fight infections and support the safety of SIRT3-directed therapies based on SIRT3 activators or inhibitors for treating metabolic, oncologic and neurodegenerative diseases without putting patients at risk of infection."
0,Emerging novel and antimicrobial-resistant respiratory tract infections: new drug development and therapeutic options.,"The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens for which diminishing treatment options are available is of major global concern. New viral respiratory tract infections with epidemic potential, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, swine-origin influenza A H1N1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, require development of new antiviral agents. The substantial rise in the global numbers of patients with respiratory tract infections caused by pan-antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and multiazole-resistant fungi has focused attention on investments into development of new drugs and treatment regimens. Successful treatment outcomes for patients with respiratory tract infections across all health-care settings will necessitate rapid, precise diagnosis and more effective and pathogen-specific therapies. This Series paper describes the development and use of new antimicrobial agents and immune-based and host-directed therapies for a range of conventional and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal causes of respiratory tract infections. "
0,"Infections after lung transplantation: time of occurrence, sites, and microbiologic etiologies.","Infections are major causes of both early and late death after lung transplantation (LT). The development of prophylaxis strategies has altered the epidemiology of post-LT infections; however, recent epidemiological data are limited. We evaluated infections after LT at our institution by time of occurrence, site of infections, and microbiologic etiologies.All consecutive patients undergoing lung or heart-lung transplantation between October 2008 and August 2014 at our institution were enrolled. Cases of infections after LT were initially identified from the prospective registry database, which was followed by a detailed review of the patients' medical records.A total of 108 episodes of post-LT infections (56 bacterial, 43 viral, and nine fungal infections) were observed in 34 LT recipients. Within 1 month after LT, the most common bacterial infections were catheter-related bloodstream infections (42%). Pneumonia was the most common site of bacterial infection in the 2- to 6-month period (28%) and after 6 months (47%). Cytomegalovirus was the most common viral infection within 1 month (75%) and in the 2- to 6-month period (80%). Respiratory viruses were the most common viruses after 6 months (48%). Catheter-related candidemia was the most common fungal infection. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis developed after 6 months. Survival rates at the first and third years were 79% and 73%, respectively.Although this study was performed in a single center, we provide valuable and recent detailed epidemiology data for post-LT infections. A further multicenter study is required to properly evaluate the epidemiology of post-LT infections in Korea."
0,"Radioimmunotherapy as a Novel Approach in HIV, Bacterial, and Fungal Infectious Diseases.","In the past several decades, many antimicrobial agents have been used in treating different fungal, bacterial, and viral infections. However, these agents have faced challenges such as pronounced side-effect profiles and pathogen resistance. In addition, a cure for many chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has not been achieved, and the incidence of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients has increased significantly in the past decades. Therefore, an alternative strategy for combating these infections is needed. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has been proposed to be a valuable tool in the management of such infections. The side-effects associated with RIT are minimal as the targeted antigens are only expressed on microbial or infected cells. RIT demonstrated impressive potency in eradicating pathogens in animal models and patient samples. Cryptococcus neoformans, HIV, and Bacillus anthracis are few examples of infections for which RIT has been an effective treatment using radionuclides such as bismuth-213 (<sup>213</sup>Bi) or rhenium-188 (<sup>188</sup>Re)."
0,The importance of fungal pathogens and antifungal coatings in medical device infections.,"In recent years, increasing evidence has been collated on the contributions of fungal species, particularly Candida, to medical device infections. Fungal species can form biofilms by themselves or by participating in polymicrobial biofilms with bacteria. Thus, there is a clear need for effective preventative measures, such as thin coatings that can be applied onto medical devices to stop the attachment, proliferation, and formation of device-associated biofilms. However, fungi being eukaryotes, the challenge is greater than for bacterial infections because antifungal agents are often toxic towards eukaryotic host cells. Whilst there is extensive literature on antibacterial coatings, a far lesser body of literature exists on surfaces or coatings that prevent attachment and biofilm formation on medical devices by fungal pathogens. Here we review strategies for the design and fabrication of medical devices with antifungal surfaces. We also survey the microbiology literature on fundamental mechanisms by which fungi attach and spread on natural and synthetic surfaces. Research in this field requires close collaboration between biomaterials scientists, microbiologists and clinicians; we consider progress in the molecular understanding of fungal recognition of, and attachment to, suitable surfaces, and of ensuing metabolic changes, to be essential for designing rational approaches towards effective antifungal coatings, rather than empirical trial of coatings."
0,"Emerging bacterial, fungal, and viral respiratory infections in transplantation.","Kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, lung, and small intestine transplantations are viable therapeutic options for patients with end-stage organ failure. Ongoing advancements of surgical techniques, immunosuppressive regimens, and perioperative management have resulted in improved survival of allograft recipients. Despite these refinements, infections still contribute to substantial morbidity and mortality, limiting long-term success rates of these procedures. This article discusses the emerging bacterial, fungal, and viral respiratory infections in transplantation."
0,"Immune responses to bacterial and fungal infections in the silkworm, Bombyx mori.","The silkworm Bombyx mori, an economically important insect that is usually reared indoors, is susceptible to various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and microsporidia. As with other insects, the silkworm lacks an adaptive immune system and relies solely on innate immunity to defend itself against infection. Compared to other intensively studied insects, such as the fruit fly and tobacco hornworm, the principal immune pathways in the silkworm remain unclear. In this article, we review the literature concerning silkworm immune responses to bacteria and fungi and present our perspectives on future research into silkworm immunity."
0,Surveillance of bacterial and fungal infections in the postoperative period following liver transplantation: a series from 2005-2011.,"Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a life-saving procedure for the treatment of many end-stage diseases, but infectious and acute rejection episodes remain major causes of morbidity and mortality. Bacterial and fungal infections can be due to intra-abdominal, biliary, respiratory, urinary, wound, central venous catheters (CVC) or unknown sources. Using the computerized database of our microbiology laboratory, we analyzed all the bacterial and fungal infections in the first three months following OLT among 151 consecutive adult recipients at single center between January 2005 and December 2011. Samples included blood, bile CVC, urine, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen. Culture and identification of the isolated microorganisms was done in accordance with standard microbiological procedures. Three hundred thirteen samples from the above sites showed positive results for gram-positive cocci (n = 137; 43.8%), gram-negative rods (n = 156; 49.8%), and Candida species (n = 19; 6.1%). One patient (0.3%) experienced a CVC-related infection caused by Fusarium oxysporum. Bacterial and particularly biliary tract infections seem to play major roles in morbidity and mortality in the first three months following OLT. The major contributors to patient morbidity and mortality were candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis mainly from the biliary tract and/or CVC-related infections."
0,"Genetic, immunological, and clinical features of patients with bacterial and fungal infections due to inherited IL-17RA deficiency.","Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is defined as recurrent or persistent infection of the skin, nails, and/or mucosae with commensal Candida species. The first genetic etiology of isolated CMC-autosomal recessive (AR) IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) deficiency-was reported in 2011, in a single patient. We report here 21 patients with complete AR IL-17RA deficiency, including this first patient. Each patient is homozygous for 1 of 12 different IL-17RA alleles, 8 of which create a premature stop codon upstream from the transmembrane domain and have been predicted and/or shown to prevent expression of the receptor on the surface of circulating leukocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Three other mutant alleles create a premature stop codon downstream from the transmembrane domain, one of which encodes a surface-expressed receptor. Finally, the only known missense allele (p.D387N) also encodes a surface-expressed receptor. All of the alleles tested abolish cellular responses to IL-17A and -17F homodimers and heterodimers in fibroblasts and to IL-17E/IL-25 in leukocytes. The patients are currently aged from 2 to 35 y and originate from 12 unrelated kindreds. All had their first CMC episode by 6 mo of age. Fourteen patients presented various forms of staphylococcal skin disease. Eight were also prone to various bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. Human IL-17RA is, thus, essential for mucocutaneous immunity to Candida and Staphylococcus, but otherwise largely redundant. A diagnosis of AR IL-17RA deficiency should be considered in children or adults with CMC, cutaneous staphylococcal disease, or both, even if IL-17RA is detected on the cell surface."
0,Invasive bacterial and fungal infections among hospitalized HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children and infants in northern Tanzania.,"To describe the contribution of paediatric HIV and of HIV co-infections to admissions to a hospital in Moshi, Tanzania, using contemporary laboratory methods.During 1 year, we enrolled consecutively admitted patients aged ???2 months and <13 years with current or recent fever. All patients underwent standardized clinical history taking, a physical examination and HIV antibody testing; standard aerobic blood cultures and malaria film were also done, and hospital outcome was recorded. Early infant HIV diagnosis by HIV-1 RNA PCR was performed on those aged <18 months. HIV-infected patients also received serum cryptococcal antigen testing and had their CD4-positive T-lymphocyte count and percent determined.A total of 467 patients were enrolled whose median age was 2 years (range 2 months-13 years); Of those patients, 57.2% were female and 12.2% were HIV-infected. Admission clinical diagnosis of HIV disease was made in 10.7% and of malaria in 60.4%. Of blood cultures, 5.8% grew pathogens; of these 25.9% were Salmonella enterica (including 6 Salmonella Typhi) and 22.2%Streptococcus pneumoniae. Plasmodium falciparum was identified on blood film of 1.3%. HIV infection was associated with S. pneumoniae (odds ratio 25.7, 95% CI 2.8, 234.0) bloodstream infection (BSI), but there was no evidence of an association with Escherichia coli or P. falciparum; Salmonella Typhi BSI occurred only among HIV-uninfected participants. The sensitivity and specificity of an admission clinical diagnosis of malaria were 100% and 40.3%; and for an admission diagnosis of bloodstream infection, they were 9.1% and 86.4%, respectively.Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bloodstream infection among paediatric admissions in Tanzania and is closely associated with HIV infection. Malaria was over-diagnosed clinically, whereas invasive bacterial disease was underestimated. HIV and HIV co-infections contribute to a substantial proportion of paediatric febrile admissions, underscoring the value of routine HIV testing."
0,[Bacterial and fungal infections in kidney transplant recipients].,"Despite advances in the scientific knowledge related to organ transplantation, kidney transplant recipients remain patients who must take immunosuppressive therapy for the rest of their lives to prevent graft rejection. This situation, coupled with the possible need for medical care, whether invasive or noninvasive, and higher hospitalization rates than in the general population, puts the patient with a transplanted kidney at risk of developing infectious diseases. An important threat are bacterial infections of the urinary tract at different levels of severity (from asymptomatic bacteriuria to urinary septicemia), which in recent years have included infections by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Careful attention must be paid therefore to the overall management of kidney transplant recipients with infections and to the ""ecological"" use of antibiotic therapy, which aims at preventing antibiotic resistance according to the recent concept of antibiotic stewardship. Among the fungal infections candida infections require special consideration. As with bacterial infections, there may be different degrees of severity ranging from candiduria (where some see no indication for treatment) to pyelonephritis and candidemia, conditions that may lead to vascular complications and the possible rupture of blood vessels. The key to success in the fight against infections after kidney transplant lies in the multidisciplinary approach to their management, with the involvement of the nephrologist, transplant surgeon, infectiologist, clinical microbiologist and clinical pharmacologist."
0,Reduced Neutrophil Elastase Activity and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia May Increase the Rate of Infections.,"Data on the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in leukemia patients are scant. Phagocytosis, hydrogen peroxide, neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase enzymatic activity as well as NETs formation were studied in 10 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 7 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients after induction chemotherapy. Median neutrophil elastase activity and NETs formation were lower in AML versus acute lymphoblastic leukemia (41% vs. 90%, P=0.005 and 51% vs. 94%, P=0.008, respectively). AML patients had more episodes of febrile neutropenia during the first 2 blocks of treatment (100% vs. 40%, P=0.011) and a trend for more invasive bacterial and fungal infections."
0,Device-associated infections in the pediatric intensive care unit at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.,"Device-associated healthcare-associated infections (DA-HAIs) are the principal threat to patient safety in intensive care units (ICUs).?? The primary objective of this study was to identify the most common DA-HAIs in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC). Length of stay (LOS) and mortality, antimicrobial resistance patterns, and suitability of empiric antibiotic choices for DA-HAIs according to the local resistance patterns were also studied.This was a retrospective study that included all patients admitted to the PICU at AUBMC between January 2007 and December 2011. All patients admitted to the PICU having a placed central line, an endotracheal tube, and/or a Foley catheter were included. Data was extracted from the patients' medical records through chart review. A total of 22 patients were identified with 25 central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), 25 ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and 9 catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). The causing organisms, their resistance patterns, and the appropriateness of empiric antimicrobial therapy were reported.Gram-negative pathogens were found in 53% of the DA-HAIs, Gram-positive ones in 27%, and fungal organisms in 20%. A total of 80% of K. pneumonia isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producers, and 30% of Pseudomonas isolates were multidrug resistant. No methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were isolated. Based on culture results, the choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy was appropriate in 64% of the DA-HAIs.After the care bundle approach is adopted in our PICU, DA-HAIs are expected to decrease further."
0,Changing of bloodstream infections in a medical center neonatal intensive care unit.,"Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are associated with high mortality and morbidity in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The epidemiology of these infections may change after the application of new infection control policies. The aims of this study are to reveal the changing epidemiology of BSIs in our NICU and inspect the effects of infection control efforts.We reviewed and analyzed the clinical characteristics of culture-proven BSIs in our NICU from 2008 to 2013 and compared them with our two previously reported data (1992-2001 and 2002-2007).The mortality rate decreased from 16.3% in 1992-2001 to 5.6% in 2008-2013. In the recent study period, Gram-positive infections became predominant (58.0%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci remained the most commonly isolated organisms (26.0%). Group B Streptococcus (GBS) BSIs had the highest mortality rate (30.0%). Most GBS-infected infants' mother did not perform prenatal GBS screening. There was a decrease in the total fungal infection rate after fluconazole prophylaxis for very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates, but the infections of fluconazole-resistant Malassezia pachydermatis increased. The incidence of central line-associated BSI increased to 10.6% in 2011. After restricting the catheter duration to <21 days, the incidence decreased to 4.2% in 2013.Through the years, the overall mortality rate of BSIs in our NICU decreased. Maternal GBS screening is an important issue for avoiding early onset GBS mortality. Fungal infection rate decreased after antifungal prophylaxis policy for VLBW infants, but we should be aware of resistant strains. Restriction of the catheter duration may decrease the incidence of catheter-related BSI."
0,Respiratory infections associated with anti-TNF?? agents.,"Anti-TNF?? agents have proved effective in the treatment of various inflammatory, rheumatologic, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal diseases. Severe respiratory tract infections of bacterial or fungal origin have emerged as important complications in patients receiving such treatments. The risk of infection due to anti-TNF?? therapy is difficult to assess in these patients who are immunocompromised because of the underlying disease itself and of previous or concomitant immunosuppressive drugs. This excessive infection risk seems real, particularly in the first six months following treatment initiation, and higher for patients receiving anti-TNF?? monoclonal antibodies than for those receiving soluble TNF?? receptor. The involved pathogens are pyogenic bacteria but also Mycobacterium??tuberculosis, mostly by reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection, warranting a systematic preventive approach to screening and chemoprophylaxis before initiating the anti-TNF?? therapy. In countries with low tuberculosis endemicity, an increased prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections has been reported. The incidence rate of legionellosis is high in this population. In case of pneumonia, empirical antibiotic therapy should cover Legionella??pneumophila. Several cases of histoplasmosis have also been reported and this diagnosis should be suspected in patients who have traveled to endemic areas. Other opportunistic infections have been reported including Pneumocystis pneumonia, aspergillosis, and nocardiosis mostly in patients receiving other immunosuppressive treatments. The risk of infection should be evaluated as an individual risk depending on comorbidities and past or concomitant treatments."
0,[Usefulness of PK/PD parameters of antimicrobials in the treatment of complex and extremely-resistant infections].,"Complex or difficult to treat infections should benefit from antimicrobial PK/PD data in each specific situation. In the case of multidrug resistant gram negative infections the optimized use of colistin needs the using of PK/PD indexes. Likewise, in infections of inaccessible sources, PK/PD concepts play a key role in choosing the best antimicrobial and dosage. An example would be the potential role of linezolid in CNS infections. Among fungal infections, symptomatic candiduria by fluconazole-resistant strains are a therapeutic challenge. In this context micafungin could be a good alternative, again based on PK/PD concepts. "
0,Fungal Infections Increase the Mortality Rate Three-Fold in Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infections.,"Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) result in significant morbidity and mortality rates, with as many as 76% of patients dying during their index admission. Published data suggest NSTIs rarely involve fungal infections in immunocompetent patients. However, because of the recent recognition of fungal infections in our population, we hypothesized that such infections frequently complicate NSTIs and are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates.A prospectively maintained Acute and Critical Care Surgery (ACCS) database spanning 2008-2015 and including more than 7,000 patients was queried for patients with NSTIs. Microbiologic data, demographics, and clinical outcomes were abstracted. Risk factors and outcomes associated with NSTI with positive intra-operative fungal cultures were determined. Frequencies were compared by ??<sup>2</sup> and continuous variables by the Student t-test using SPSS. Because the study included only archived data, no patient permission was needed.A total of 230 patients were found to have NSTIs; 197 had intra-operative cultures, and 21 (10.7%) of these were positive for fungi. Fungal infection was more common in women, patients with higher body mass index (BMI), and patients who had had prior abdominal procedures. There were no significant differences in demographics, co-morbidities, or site of infection. The majority of patients (85.7%) had mixed bacterial and fungal infections; in the remaining patients, fungi were the only species isolated. Most fungal cultures were collected within 48?€?h of hospital admission, suggesting that the infections were not hospital acquired. Patients with positive fungal cultures required two more surgical interventions and had a three-fold greater mortality rate than patients without fungal infections.This is the largest series to date describing the impact of fungal infection in NSTIs. Our data demonstrate a three-fold increase in the mortality rate and the need for two additional operations. Consideration should be given to starting patients on empiric anti-fungal therapy in certain circumstances."
0,Bacterial and fungal infections in the early post-transplantation period after liver transplantation: etiologic agents and their susceptibility.,"It has been reported in many studies that one of the main factors influencing morbidity and mortality in patients receiving transplants is infection after transplantation.The study included 190 adult patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) between September 2001 and December 2007. All the patients were followed prospectively for infections from the OLT date and during the first 4 weeks after surgery. Immunosuppression consisted of steroids and tacrolimus. Antimicrobial prophylaxis included piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole, and selective bowel decontamination (SBD) was performed. Samples of clinical materials were investigated for microbiological cultures. The micro-organisms were cultured and identified in accordance with standard bacteriological procedures. Susceptibility testing was performed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute procedures.From 190 OLT recipients, 2213 clinical samples were obtained for microbiological examination. Positive cultures were found in 27.2% (n = 603) of all samples tested; 1252 strains were collected. Gram-positive bacteria were found in 64.1% (n = 802), Gram-negative bacteria were found in 31.6% (n = 396), and fungal strains were isolated in 4.3% (n = 54). Surgical site specimens (n = 1031) were obtained from 190 recipients during the first month after transplantation. Positive cultures accounted for 29.2% (n = 301) of all samples tested. Among the isolated microbial strains (n = 677), most common were Gram-positive bacteria (73.7%; n = 499). Gram-negative bacteria comprised 25.1% (n = 170). There were fungal strains in 1.2% (n = 8). There were 539 urine specimens. Positive cultures accounted for 16.7% (n = 90) of those. Among the isolated microbial strains (n = 210), most common were Gram-negative bacteria (62.4%; n = 131). Gram-positive bacteria comprised 28.6% (n = 60) and fungi 9% (n = 19). There were 549 blood specimens. Positive cultures were found in 30.6% (n = 168) of all samples tested. Among the isolated microbial strains (n = 263), most common were Gram-positive bacteria in 72.3% (n = 190); Gram-negative bacteria were found in 26.2% (n = 69), and fungal strains were isolated in 1.5% (n = 4). There were 69 respiratory tract specimens. Positive cultures were found in 46.4% (n = 32) of all samples tested. Among the isolated microbial strains (n = 84), most common were Gram-positive bacteria (51.2%; n = 43); Gram-negative bacteria comprised 27.4% (n = 23) and fungi 21.4% (n = 18).(1) Surgical site samples were predominated samples after LTx. (2) Our study showed Gram-positive bacteria were 64.1% (n = 802), Gram-negative bacteria, 31.6% (n = 396) and fungal strains isolated in 4.3% (n = 54). (3) The increased proportion of isolates of multi-drug-resistant bacterial strains (methicillin resistant coagulase negative Staphylococcus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, high-level aminoglycoside resistance, and extended- spectrum ??-lactamase).

0,Infections after T-replete haploidentical transplantation and high-dose cyclophosphamide as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis.,"Recently, a platform of T-cell replete haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) using post-transplant cyclophosphamide (Cy) has shown high reproducibility and acceptable safety profile.This prospective cohort analysis allowed us to collect data on infections among 70 consecutive recipients of haplo-HSCT affected by various hematologic malignancies.After a median follow-up of 23??months, cumulative incidence of viral infections was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 59-81) at 100??days and 77% (95% CI 67-87) at 1??year; 35 of 65 patients at risk had CMV reactivation (54%) and the rate of polyomavirus-virus-associated cystitis was 19% (13/70). Cumulative incidence of bacterial and fungal infections at 1??year were 63% (95% CI 51-75) and 12% (95% CI 4-19), respectively. Of note, only 1 invasive fungal infection occurred beyond 1??year after transplant (day +739).In conclusion, despite a high rate of viral infections in the early period, present data suggest a satisfactory infectious profile after T-cell replete haplo-HSCT using post-transplant Cy. These results may help clinicians to improve both prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial strategies in this emerging haploidentical setting."
0,Early infections after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children and adolescents: the St. Jude experience.,"Advances in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) over the past 20 years may have had an impact on the morbidity and mortality associated with infections post transplant.We sought to retrospectively analyze the epidemiology of the first episode of bacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic infections 0-30 days post transplant in a cohort of 320 children and adolescents who underwent autologous HSCT in a single institution, between 1990 and 2009 for solid tumors or lymphoma, and in 65 children transplanted for acute leukemia during the same period.Infections occurred in 66 (21%) patients with solid tumors or lymphoma. Bacterial infections occurred in 33 (10%) including bacteremia in 23 (7%), and viral infections in 34 (11%) patients. Gram-positive bacterial infections were more prevalent than gram-negative bacterial infections (P = 0.03). Infections caused by fungal or parasitic pathogens were uncommon. The decade when transplant was performed (1990-1999 vs. 2000-2009) had no impact on the incidence of bacterial (P = 0.41) or viral (P = 0.47) infection. Between 1990 and 1999, a total of 60 (92%) children were transplanted for leukemia, and 5 (8%) in the 2000-2009 period (P < 0.0001). Infections occurred in 32 (49%) patients. Bacterial (P = 0.004), candidal (P = 0.003), and herpes simplex viral (P = 0.03) infections were more common in patients transplanted for leukemia. In patients transplanted for leukemia, 3 deaths occurred attributed to infection, all before 2000.Changes in epidemiology of infection are likely a result of decline in autologous transplantation for childhood leukemia in the recent era. Autologous transplantation for solid tumors or lymphoma was not associated with mortality from early infections at our institution."
0,Epidemiology of bloodstream infections after myeloablative and non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: A single-center cohort study.,"Patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) often develop bloodstream infections (BSI). We aimed to describe the etiologies and antibiotic resistance patterns of BSI after allo-HSCT, and, as knowledge about the impact of conditioning regimen is limited, we looked at the incidence, timing, risk factors, and mortality of BSI separately for myeloablative (MA)- and non-myeloablative (NMA)-conditioned patients.All 460 patients (207 MA- and 253 NMA-conditioned) who underwent their first allo-HSCT at our center from 2008 to 2013 were included in a historical cohort. BSI were registered from initiation of conditioning to day 360 after transplantation.BSI occurred in 34% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28%, 41%) of MA-conditioned patients and in 17% (95% CI: 12%, 22%) of NMA-conditioned patients. Of all isolates, 68% were gram-positive bacteria (GPB), 23% gram-negative bacteria (GNB), and 9% fungi. The GPB/GNB ratio declined from 2008 to 2014 (P for trend <.01). Of all GNB, 47% were multidrug resistant (MDR), but the proportion declined over the study period. In a multivariate Cox regression model, only acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with a higher hazard of first BSI (hazard ratio 2.50, 95% CI: 1.48, 4.21). Overall 30-day survival after a BSI was higher for MA-conditioned patients than for NMA-conditioned patients (89% vs 74%, P=.04).MA-conditioned patients experience BSI more often than NMA-conditioned patients in the year after allo-HSCT. While BSI are increasingly caused by GNB, the rate of MDR GNB is declining."
0,Soil-related bacterial and fungal infections.,"A variety of classic and emerging soil-related bacterial and fungal pathogens cause serious human disease that frequently presents in primary care settings. Typically, the growth of these microorganisms is favored by particular soil characteristics and may involve complex life cycles including amoebae or animal hosts. Specific evolved virulence factors or the ability to grow in diverse, sometimes harsh, microenvironments may promote pathogenesis. Infection may occur by direct inoculation or ingestion, ingestion of contaminated food, or inhalation. This narrative review describes the usual presentations and environmental sources of soil-related infections. In addition to tetanus, anthrax, and botulism, soil bacteria may cause gastrointestinal, wound, skin, and respiratory tract diseases. The systemic fungi are largely acquired via inhalation from contaminated soil and near-soil environments. These fungal infections are particularly life-threatening in those with compromised immune systems. Questions regarding soil exposure should be included in the history of any patient with syndromes consistent with tetanus, botulism or anthrax, traumatic wounds, recalcitrant skin lesions, gastroenteritis, and nonresponsive, overwhelming, or chronic pneumonia."
0,"Preclinical testing of radiopharmaceuticals for novel applications in HIV, bacterial and fungal infectious diseases.","Antibiotics, antifungal and antiviral medications have traditionally been used in the management of infections. Due to widespread emergence of resistance to antimicrobial medications, and their side effects, there is a growing need for alternative approaches for management of such conditions. Antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens are on the rise. A cure has not been achieved for viral infections like AIDS, while fungal and parasitic infections are constant threats to the health of general public. The incidence of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals like HIV patients, patients receiving high dose steroids, chemotherapy patients, and organ transplant recipients is on the rise. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has the potential to be a suitable and viable therapeutic modality in the arena of infection management. Provided the target-associated antigen is expressed by the target cells and minimally or not expressed by other tissues, selective targeting of radiation to target sites can be theoretically accomplished with relative sparing normal tissues from radiation exposure. In our laboratory we successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of RIT for treating infectious diseases. We targeted murine cryptococcosis with a mAb to the Cryptococcus neoformans capsular glucuronoxylomannan labeled with Bismuth-213 ((213)Bi) or Rhenium-188 ((188)Re). We subsequently extended the applicability of RIT for treating bacterial and viral infections. One of the advantages of using RIT to treat infections as opposed to cancer is that, in contrast to tumor cells, cells expressing microbial antigens are antigenically very different from host tissues and thus provide the potential for exquisite specificity and low cross-reactivity. Ever increasing incidence of infectious pathologies, exhaustion of antimicrobial possibilities and rising drug resistance calls for use of alternative and novel therapeutic options and we believe RIT is the need of the hour to combat these infections."
0,The Association between Infections and General Cognitive Ability in Young Men - A Nationwide Study.,"Infections and activated immune responses can affect the brain through several pathways that might also affect cognition. However, no large-scale study has previously investigated the effect of infections on the general cognitive ability in the general population.Danish nationwide registers were linked to establish a cohort of all 161,696 male conscripts during the years 2006-2012 who were tested for cognitive ability, which was based on logical, verbal, numerical and spatial reasoning at a mean age of 19.4 years. Test scores were converted to a mean of 100.00 and with a standard deviation (SD) of 15. Data were analyzed as a cohort study with severe infections requiring hospitalization as exposure using linear regression.Adjusted effect sizes were calculated with non-exposure to severe infections as reference, ranging from 0.12 SD to 0.63 SD on general cognitive ability. A prior infection was associated with significantly lower cognitive ability by a mean of 1.76 (95%CI: -1.92 to -1.61; corresponding to 0.12 SD). The cognitive ability was affected the most by the temporal proximity of the last infection (P<0.001) and by the severity of infection measured by days of admission (P<0.001). The number of infections were associated with decreased cognitive ability in a dose-response relationship, and highest mean differences were found for ???10 hospital contacts for infections (Mean: -5.54; 95%CI: -7.20 to -3.89; corresponding to 0.37 SD), and for ???5 different types of infections (Mean: -9.44; 95%CI: -13.2 to -5.69; corresponding to 0.63 SD). Hospital contacts with infections had occurred in 35% of the individuals prior to conscription.Independent of a wide range of possible confounders, significant associations between infections and cognitive ability were observed. Infections or related immune responses might directly affect the cognitive ability; however, associated heritable and environmental factors might also account for the lowered cognitive ability."
0,Prevention and treatment of cancer-related infections.,"Patients with cancer are at increased risk for developing infectious complications during the course of their disease and treatment. The following sections of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Prevention and Treatment of Cancer-Related Infections provide an overview of the risk factors for infectious complications, recommendations for infectious risk categorization, and strategies for prevention of infections in high-risk patient populations with cancer. Individualized risk evaluation for infections and incorporation of preventative measures are essential components of the overall spectrum of cancer care, and may contribute to optimizing treatment outcomes for patients."
0,[Microbiological characteristics and patterns of resistance in prosthetic joint infections in a referral hospital].,"The prosthetic joint infection is the most feared and catastrophic complication for cause severe physical damage to patients and, generates high economic costs.To describe the microbiological characteristics and to determine the resistance pattern in prosthetic joint infections in a reference hospital in Mexico.Patients whose prosthetic devices were withdrawn due to suspicion of septic and aseptic loosening were included. Cultures were performed to identify microorganisms and susceptibility analysis.Of the 111 patients included, 55% were diagnosed with prosthetic joint infection, with the most frequent prosthesis being of the hip (43%). Positive cultures were obtained in 97% of the infected cases, of which 75% were monomicrobial infections. The most frequent bacterial species isolated were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (31%), Enterococcus faecalis (16%), Staphylococcus aureus (13%), and Escherichia coli (8%). The resistance patterns for the Staphylococcus genus were: oxacillin (79%), erythromycin (45%) and ciprofloxacin (37%). Enterococcus faecalis showed a high percentage of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin (86%), and fluoroquinolones (43%). The large majority (86%) of Escherichia coli were extended spectrum beta-lactamases positive, in addition to having high resistance to fluoroquinolones (86%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (86%) and gentamicin (72%).The microbiological characteristics found in prosthetic joint infections vary according to the hospitals. In this series, a high proportion of coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Enterococcus spp. were found, as well as a high bacterial resistance."
0,Epidemiology of diabetic foot infections in a reference tertiary hospital in India.,"The present study attempts to examine the microbial profile and antibiotic susceptibility of diabetic foot infections in the intensive care unit of a tertiary referral centre for diabetic foot. As part of the study, we also attempted to find the prevalence of blaNDM-like gene among carbapenem-resistant gram negative infections.A prospective study of 261 patients with diabetic foot infections was performed during the period between January 2014 and June 2014.A total of 289 isolates were obtained from 178 tissue samples from 261 patients, 156 (59.7%) males and 105 (40.2%) females, with a mean age of 58 years (-15 years), having diabetic foot infection. No growth was seen in thirty eight (17.6%) tissue samples. Out of the total samples, 44.3% were monomicrobial and 55.7% were polymicrobial. Gram negative pathogens were predominant (58.5%). Seven of the total isolates were fungal; 0.7% showed pure fungal growth and 1.7% were mixed, grown along with some bacteria. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (26.9%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.9%). Of the 58.5% gram negative pathogens, 16.5% were Enterobacteriaceae resistant to carbapenems. Among these isolates, 4 (25%) were positive for blaNDM-like gene. Among the rest, 18.6% were carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas, among which 4 (36.3%) were blaNDM. Among the Staphylococci, 23.7% were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Our results support the recent view that gram negative organisms, depending on the geographical location, may be predominant in DFIs. There is an increase in multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially carbapenem resistance and this is creeping rapidly. We need to be more judicious while using empiric antibiotics."
0,[Prophylaxis of infections post-allogeneic transplantation: Guidelines from the Francophone Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (SFGM-TC)].,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment for many hematological diseases. However, this procedure causes the patient to be susceptible to infection. Prophylactic treatments are administered in clinical practice even thought the level of evidence of their effectiveness is not always high. In addition, changes in the transplantation procedures - use of reduced intensity conditioning, development of alternative graft sources - must lead to a rethinking of attitudes towards prophylaxis. Our working group based its recommendations on a review of referential articles and publications on the subject found in the literature. These recommendations concern the prophylaxis of infections caused by HSV1, HSV2, varicella zoster, and hepatitis B, as well as anti-bacterial and digestive decontamination prophylaxis, prevention of pneumocystis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, as well as prophylaxis of fungal infections. Other infectious agents usually involved in infections post-allotransplant have been the subject of another set of recommendations from the French Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy."
0,"Infections during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis and prevention.","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life support technique used in patients with respiratory and/or cardiac failure. The ECMO circuit consists of vascular cannulae, a pump and an artificial lung. Infections are among the most common complications associated with ECMO and have a significant impact on the mortality rate. Here we present a narrative literature review regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis and prevention of infectious complications during ECMO support. The prevalence of hospital-acquired infections during ECMO is 10-12% and their occurrence is likely to be more frequent compared with other critically ill patients. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Candida spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most frequently involved pathogens. A high incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was reported (24.4 cases/1000 ECMO days), with a major role unexpectedly played by Enterobacteriaceae. The infectious risk was shown to increase along the duration of the ECMO run, which represents the most important risk factor for the development of infections. Other ECMO-specific factors predisposing to infections include the severity of illness in ECMO patients, the high risk of bacterial translocation from the gut, and ECMO-related impairment of the immune system. Another important issue could be microbial colonisation of catheters, ECMO cannulae and the oxygenator, which is consistent with most commonly observed aetiologies."
0,Healthcare-Associated Infections in Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Units: Impact of Underlying Risk Factors and Antimicrobial Resistance on 30-Day Case-Fatality in Italy and Brazil.,"OBJECTIVES To describe trends in the epidemiology of healthcare-associated Infections (HAIs) in pediatric/neonatal intensive care units (ICUs) and to evaluate risk factors and impact of multidrug resistance in children admitted to ICUs. DESIGN Multicenter, retrospective, cohort study with a nested case-control study conducted from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014. SETTING Three tertiary care pediatric hospitals in Italy and Brazil with a total of 103 ICU beds. PATIENTS Inclusion criteria were admission to ICU during the study period, age at onset less than 18 years, and microbiologically confirmed HAI. RESULTS A total of 538 HAIs in 454 children were included; 93.3% of patients had comorbidities. Bloodstream infections were the leading pattern (45.4%). The cumulative incidence of HAI was 3.6/100 ICU admissions and the crude 30-day fatality rate was 5.7/1,000 admissions. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Enterobacteriaceae, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Forty-four percent of isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Two multivariate logistic regressions were performed. Factors independently associated with an MDR-HAI were country, previous antibiotics, transplantation, major surgery, and colonization by an MDR strain. Factors independently associated with 30-day case fatality were country, previous transplantation, fungal infection, bloodstream infection, lower respiratory tract infection, and infection caused by MDR strains. CONCLUSIONS Infection control and prevention can limit the spread of MDR strains and improve outcomes. Targeted surveillance programs collecting neonatal and pediatric HAI/bloodstream infection data and outcomes would allow global benchmarking. The next step is to identify methods to monitor key HAIs and integrate these into affordable intervention programs. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;1-8."
0,Impact of pretransplant rifaximin therapy on early post-liver transplant infections.,"Bacterial and fungal infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation (LT). The role of intestinal decontamination in the prevention of post-LT infections is controversial. Rifaximin is widely used for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. The effect of rifaximin on post-LT infections is unknown. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of rifaximin therapy in the pretransplant period on early bacterial infections (EBIs) and fungal infections within the first 30 days after LT. All adult patients who underwent LT at our institution (January 2009 to July 2011) were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients receiving antibiotics other than pretransplant protocol antibiotics were excluded. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of rifaximin therapy for at least 2 days before LT. Infections were defined by the isolation of any bacterial or fungal organisms within 30 days of LT. Multivariate regression analysis, Student t tests, and Pearson's chi-square tests were used to compare the 2 groups. Two hundred sixty-eight patients were included, and 71 of these patients (26.5%) were on rifaximin at the time of LT. The 2 groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, race, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. There were no significant differences in the rates of EBIs (30% for the non-rifaximin group and 25% for the rifaximin group, P?€?=?€?0.48) or fungal infections between the 2 groups. There was no increase in antimicrobial resistance among the infecting organisms. There was no difference in survival between the rifaximin and non-rifaximin groups (98% versus 97%, P?€?=?€?0.36). In conclusion, the use of rifaximin in the pre-LT period was not associated with an increased risk of bacterial or fungal infections in the early post-LT period."
0,"An unusual pathogen in ambulatory care: two cases of Scedosporium soft tissue infections presenting as ""unresponsive cellulitis"".","Soft tissue infections with Scedosporium spp. are an uncommon but serious and emerging cause of infection in immunocompromised patients. Acute Medical Units (AMUs) in the UK are increasingly managing patients with cellulitis in an outpatient setting, therefore acute physicians should be aware of some of the more uncommon causes of soft tissue infection, particularly in patients not responding to initial antibiotic therapy. We present two cases of Scedosporium presenting to the AMU as cellulitis not responding to initial antibiotic therapy and outline the assessment and management of this important condition. "
0,Bacterial-derived exopolysaccharides enhance antifungal drug tolerance in a cross-kingdom oral biofilm.,"Fungal-bacterial interactions generate unique biofilms that cause many infections in humans. Candida albicans interact with Streptococcus mutans in dental biofilms associated with severe childhood tooth-decay, a prevalent pediatric oral disease. Current modalities are ineffective and primarily based on antimicrobial monotherapies despite the polymicrobial nature of the infection. Here, we show that the combination of clinically used topical antifungal fluconazole with povidone iodine (PI) can completely suppress C. albicans carriage and mixed-biofilm formation without increasing bacterial killing activity in vivo. We unexpectedly found that the inclusion of PI enhanced fluconazole efficacy by potently disrupting the assembly of a protective bacterial exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix through inhibition of ??-glucan synthesis by S. mutans exoenzyme (GtfB) bound on the fungal surface. Further analyses revealed that the EPS produced in situ directly bind and sequester fluconazole, reducing uptake and intracellular transportation of the drug. Conversely, inhibition of GtfB activity by PI, enzymatic degradation of the ??-glucan matrix or co-culturing with gtfB-defective S. mutans re-established antifungal susceptibility. Hence, topical antifungal has limitations in mixed oral biofilms due to enhanced C. albicans tolerance to fluconazole afforded by the shielding effect of bacterial-derived EPS. The data provide new insights for treatment of C. albicans in cross-kingdom biofilms, indicating that EPS inhibitors may be required for enhanced killing efficacy and optimal anti-biofilm activity."
0,Treatment of feline otitis externa due to Otodectes cynotis and complicated by secondary bacterial and fungal infections with Oridermyl auricular ointment.,"A blinded randomized study was conducted on 24 cats to confirm the presence of bacterial and/or fungal secondary infections associated with otoacariasis and to verify the efficacy of Oridermyl, an acaricidal/antibiotic/antifungal/anti-inflammatory ointment, for treatment of the primary infestation and secondary infections. Sixteen cats were treated once daily for 10 d; 4 cats were not treated and 4 were treated with a placebo ointment. On Days 0 and 10, ears were swabbed for counts of bacteria and yeasts, for bacterial culture and sensitivity, and examined for determination of the degree of clinical otitis. Auricular secretions were removed for mite counts on Day 10, except for 8 treated cats that were done on Day 30. There was a high number of bacteria and yeasts in most cats and Oridermyl treatment significantly decreased those numbers. Staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria. No live ear mites were found in cats treated with Oridermyl or the placebo ointment."
0,Peritoneal dialysis-related infections recommendations: 2016 update. What is new?,"In 2016, the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) published guidelines that focus on the importance of both prevention and treatment of peritonitis. For once more, the need for annual reporting of peritonitis rates and recording of peritonitis and exit-site infections, isolated microorganism and antimicrobial susceptibilities as a central component of a quality improvement program is highlighted. Data on new antibiotic regimens, techniques for microorganism isolation and peritoneal dialysis solutions are included. Training of both peritoneal dialysis nurses and patients seems to be crucial, while the modifiable risk factors for peritonitis seem to be of great interest. In this article, we record the changes in the last ISPD (2016) guidelines compared to the previous ones published in 2010."
0,Fungal Infections of the Spine.,"Review of the literature.To retrospectively examine the frequency of published fungal infections by species and the treatment algorithms used to eradicate the disease.Fungal infections of the spine present unique challenges to the modern multispecialty treatment team. Although rare in comparison with bacterial infections, fungal infections have been increasing in incidence over the past several decades. Evidences-based practice is limited to referencing smaller case series.MEDLINE, Scopus, and EMBASE searches were carried out by one of the authors as well as by the research desk at the University of Miami/Calder Memorial Library. We included peer-reviewed articles published between 1948 and September 2010; case reports, series, and reviews were all examined and compiled into a database.A total of 130 articles, representing 157 cases, were included in the review. Aspergillus (60 cases, 38.2% of the total) and Candida species (36 cases, 22.9% of the total) were the 2 most common organisms. Surgery was associated with a greater survival rate than medical management alone in patients with Aspergillus (26.9% mortality in surgical patients; 60% in medically treated patients) and Candida (0% vs. 28.6%). Overall mortality was 19.3%. The overall recurrence rate was 7.4%. Amphotericin use was associated with a higher mortality rate than azoles.Aspergillus is the most common published pathogen in fungal infections of the spine. Recent publications depicting the use of newer antifungal medications such as azoles report higher survival rates. Surgically treated patients in combination with antifungal therapy showed highest frequencies of patient survival in Aspergillus and Candida infections.3."
0,Detection of bacterial pathogens from clinical specimens using conventional microbial culture and 16S metagenomics: a comparative study.,"Infectious disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and diagnosis of polymicrobial and fungal infections is increasingly challenging in the clinical setting. Conventionally, molecular detection is still the best method of species identification in clinical samples. However, the limitations of Sanger sequencing make diagnosis of polymicrobial infections one of the biggest hurdles in treatment. The development of massively parallel sequencing or next generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the field of metagenomics, with wide application of the technology in identification of microbial communities in environmental sources, human gut and others. However, to date there has been no commercial application of this technology in infectious disease diagnostic settings.Credence Genomics Rapid Infection Detection??? test, is a molecular based diagnostic test that uses next generation sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS1 gene region to provide accurate identification of species within a clinical sample. Here we present a study comparing 16S and ITS1 metagenomic identification against conventional culture for clinical samples. Using culture results as gold standard, a comparison was conducted using patient specimens from a clinical microbiology lab.Metagenomics based results show a 91.8% concordance rate for culture positive specimens and 52.8% concordance rate with culture negative samples. 10.3% of specimens were also positive for fungal species which was not investigated by culture. Specificity and sensitivity for metagenomics analysis is 91.8 and 52.7% respectively.16S based metagenomic identification of bacterial species within a clinical specimen is on par with conventional culture based techniques and when coupled with clinical information can lead to an accurate diagnostic tool for infectious disease diagnosis."
0,Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae influences the outcome of early infections in liver transplant recipients.,"Infections remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among liver transplant (LT) recipients. The aim of our study was to define the factors associated with outcome of early bacterial and fungal infections in a cohort of patients who underwent LT at the University Hospital of Ancona over a nine year period.All consecutive patients who underwent LT in our center were considered. An early infection was defined as occurring in the first month post-transplantation.Among 330 patients who underwent LT from August 2005 to October 2014, 88 (27??%) had at least one infection documented within 30??days after transplantation. In 54 cases only one site was involved, in 34 cases ???2 sites. There were 43 (30??%) pneumonia, 40 (27??%) surgical site infections, 31 (22??%) blood stream infections, and 30 (21??%) urinary tract infections. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 64??% of the culture-positive cases, followed by Gram-positive bacteria (30??%) and fungi (6??%). A high proportion of drug-resistant strains was found within either Gram-negative (79??%) or Gram-positive (81??%) bacteria. There were 27 out 88 patients (31??%) who died within 180??days from the transplant. Factors independently associated with a higher risk of mortality were: renal replacement therapy (HR 11.797 [CI95 % 3.082-45.152], p?€?<?€?0.0001), multisite infections (HR 4.865 [CI95 % 1.417-16.700], p?€?=?€?0.012) and being infected with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP; HR 5.562 [CI95 % 1.186-26.088], p?€?=?€?0.030).Overall, these data indicate that early infections in LT patients are characterized by significant mortality. In particular, an early infection caused by CRKP has an adverse impact on survival in these patients suggesting an urgent need for adopting preventive measures to avoiding this complication."
0,Invasive bacterial and fungal infections among hospitalized HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adults and adolescents in northern Tanzania.,"few studies describe patterns of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infections in African hospitals in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era.we enrolled consecutive admitted patients aged ??? 13 years with oral temperature of ??? 38.0??C during 1 year in Moshi, Tanzania. A standardized clinical history and physical examination was done and hospital outcome recorded. HIV antibody testing, aerobic and mycobacterial blood cultures, and malaria film were performed. HIV-infected patients also received serum cryptococcal antigen testing and CD4(+) T lymphocyte count (CD4 cell count).of 403 patients enrolled, the median age was 38 years (range, 14-96 years), 217 (53.8%) were female, and 157 (39.0%) were HIV-infected. Of HIV-infected patients, the median CD4 cell count was 98 cells/??L (range, 1-1,105 cells/ ??L), 20 (12.7%) were receiving ART, and 29 (18.5%) were receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. There were 112 (27.7%) patients who had evidence of invasive disease, including 26 (23.2%) with Salmonella serotype Typhi infection, 24 (21.4%) with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, 17 (15.2%) with Cryptococcus neoformans infection, 12 (10.7%) with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection, 8 (7.1%) with Plasmodium falciparum infection, and 7 (6.3%) with Escherichia coli infection. HIV infection was associated with M. tuberculosis and C. neoformans bloodstream infection but not with E. coli, S. pneumoniae, or P. falciparum infection. HIV infection appeared to be protective against Salmonella. Typhi bloodstream infection (odds ratio, .12; P = .001).while Salmonella Typhi and S. pneumoniae were the most common causes of invasive infection overall, M. tuberculosis and C. neoformans were the leading causes of bloodstream infection among HIV-infected inpatients in Tanzania in the ART era. We demonstrate a protective effect of HIV against Salmonella. Typhi bloodstream infection in this setting. HIV co-infections continue to account for a large proportion of febrile admissions in Tanzania."
0,Hepatic abscess: a rare complication after liver transplant.,"This study was conducted to evaluate the predisposing factors, microbiology, treatment, and outcomes associated with hepatic abscess, a rare but serious complication which may accur after an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).This was a retrospective study based on a prospectively maintained database of 1100 patients who underwent OLT at the Medical University of Warsaw. An abscess was defined on imaging as solitary or multiple localized parenchymal collections in patients with clinical signs of infection, with or without positive cultures from blood or abscess aspirate.Fifteen patients (1.4%) developed hepatic abscess, including 12 (80%) with multiple abscesses. Predisposing factors included biliary pathology (eight patients), hepaticojejunostomy (six patients), and hepatic artery stenosis or thrombosis (five patients). Ten patients were treated using multiple percutaneous and endoscopic interventional procedures in addition to antimicrobial treatment whereas five were treated solely with antibiotics. Five patients (33.3%) died due to multi-organ failure secondary to abscess treatment, including one unsuccessful case of re-OLT. Thirteen patients (87%) had bacterial growth and five (33.3%) had fungal growth in their blood or abscess aspirates.Hepatic abscess after liver transplantation may be treated successfully with percutaneous and endoscopic intervention, along with antibiotics according to the results of microbial cultures of blood and/or abscess aspirates."
0,Secondary Infections in Febrile Neutropenia in Hematological Malignancies: More Than Another Febrile Neutropenic Episode.,"Febrile neutropenic episodes (FNEs) are among major causes of mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. Secondary infections develop either during the empirical antibiotic therapy or one week after cessation of therapy for a FNE. The aim of the study was to investigate the risk factors associated with secondary infections in febrile neutropenic patients.We retrospectively analyzed 750 FNEs in 473 patients between January 2000 and December 2006.Secondary infections were diagnosed in 152 (20%) of 750 FNEs. The median time to develop secondary infection was 10 days (range 2-34 days). The duration of neutropenia over 10 days significantly increased the risk of secondary infections (p<0.001). The proportion of patients with microbiologically documented infections was found to be higher in primary infections (271/750, 36%) compared to secondary infections (43/152, 28%) (p=0.038). Age, sex, underlying disease, antibacterial, antifungal or antiviral prophylaxis, blood transfusion or bone marrow transplantation, central venous catheter or severity of neutropenia did not differ significantly between primary and secondary infections (p>0.05) While fever of unknown origin (FUO) (p=0.005) and catheter-related bacteremia (p<0.001) were less frequently observed in secondary infections, the frequency of microbiologically (p=0.003) and clinically (p<0.001) documented infections, fungal pneumonias (p<0.001), infections related with gram positive bacteria (p=0.04) and fungi (p<0.001) and 30-day mortality rate (p<0.001) were significantly higher in secondary infections (p<0.001).Secondary infections should be regarded as life-threatening complications of febrile neutropenia. Secondary infections represent a more severe and mortal complication and cannot be regarded just as another febrile neutropenic episode."
0,Gastrointestinal Infections.,"Gastrointestinal infections in the immunocompromised host are caused by the common bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents that also cause infections in the immunocompetent host. Of special consideration is that immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk for infection or disease severity and by pathogens not seen in the competent host. This chapter reviews the various agents, risk factors, and diagnostic approaches to detect gastrointestinal infections in this patient population."
0,Invasive fungal infections in renal transplant recipients: about 11 cases.,"Invasive fungal infections are a major complication and an important cause of morbidity and mortality among solid organ transplant recipients. Their diagnosis is difficult and their prognosis is often pejorative.The aim of this study was to report the cases of invasive fungal infections in renal transplant recipients in Habib Bourguiba Sfax university hospital and to identify the main fungal agents.It is a retrospective study of invasive fungal infections in renal transplant recipient reported in our hospital from January 1995 to February 2013.Invasive fungal infections were diagnosed in 11 cases (3.4%) among 321 renal transplant recipients. These infections included four cases of pneumocystosis, two cases of candidiasis, two cases of aspergillosis, two cases of cryptococcosis and one case of mucormycosis. There were six men and five women. The mean age was 37 years. The infection was late in 63% of cases (>3 months after transplantation). The prolonged corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy were the main risk factors (100%) followed by renal failure (45%), graft rejection (45%), broad spectrum antibiotics (45%), CMV infection (36%), neutropenia (36%) and dialysis (18%). The evolution under treatment was favourable only in two cases (18%).Invasive fungal infections are not common among kidney transplant recipients. However, they remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in this group of patients. Prevention, early diagnosis and appropriate management are necessary to improve prognosis and reduce mortality rate."
0,Ventricular assist devices as bridge to heart transplantation: impact on post-transplant infections.,"Ventricular assist devices (VAD) are valuable options for patients with heart failure awaiting cardiac transplantation. We assessed the impact of pre-transplant VAD implantation on the incidence of post-transplant infections in a nationwide cohort of heart transplant recipients.Heart transplant recipients included in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study between May 2008 and December 2012 were analyzed. Cumulative incidence curves were used to calculate the incidence of bacterial or Candida infections (primary endpoint) and of other infections (secondary endpoint) after transplant. Cox regression models treating death as a competing risk were used to identify risk factors for the development of infection after transplant.Overall, 119 patients were included in the study, 35 with a VAD and 84 without VAD. Cumulative incidences of post-transplant bacterial or Candida infections were 37.7??% in VAD patients and 40.4??% in non-VAD patients. In multivariate analysis, the use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was the only variable associated with bacterial/Candida infections after transplant (HR 0.29 [95 % CI 0.15-0.57], p?€?<?€?0.001), but presence of a VAD was not (HR 0.94, [95 % CI 0.38-2.32], p?€?=?€?0.89, for continuous-flow devices, and HR 0.45 [0.15 - 1.34], p?€?=?€?0.15, for other devices). Risk for post-transplant viral and all fungal infections was not increased in patients with VAD. One-year survival was 82.9??% (29/35) in the VAD group and 82.1??% (69/84) in the non-VAD group. All 6 patients in the VAD group that died after transplant had a history of pre-transplant VAD infection.In this nationwide cohort of heart transplant recipients, the presence of VAD at the time of transplant had no influence on the development of post-transplant infections."
0,Neonatal intensive care unit antibiotic use.,"Treatment of suspected infection is a mainstay of the daily work in the NICU. We hypothesized that NICU antibiotic prescribing practice variation correlates with rates of proven infection, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), mortality, inborn admission, and with NICU surgical volume and average length of stay.In a retrospective cohort study of 52,061 infants in 127 NICUs across California during 2013, we compared sample means and explored linear and nonparametric correlations, stratified by NICU level of care and lowest/highest antibiotic use rate quartiles.Overall antibiotic use varied 40-fold, from 2.4% to 97.1% of patient-days; median = 24.5%. At all levels of care, it was independent of proven infection, NEC, surgical volume, or mortality. Fifty percent of intermediate level NICUs were in the highest antibiotic use quartile, yet most of these units reported infection rates of zero. Regional NICUs in the highest antibiotic quartile reported inborn admission rate 218% higher (0.24 vs 0.11, P = .03), and length of stay 35% longer (90.2 days vs 66.9 days, P = .03) than regional NICUs in the lowest quartile.Forty-fold variation in NICU antibiotic prescribing practice across 127 NICUs with similar burdens of proven infection, NEC, surgical volume, and mortality indicates that a considerable portion of antibiotic use lacks clear warrant; in some NICUs, antibiotics are overused. Additional study is needed to establish appropriate use ranges and elucidate the determinants and directionality of relationships between antibiotic and other resource use."
0,Epidural abscess caused by Schizophyllum commune: A rare case of rhinogenic cranial complication by a filamentous basidiomycete.,"Central nervous system (CNS) infections due to filamentous basidiomycetes are extremely rare. We encountered a case of epidural abscess due to Schizophyllum commune that extended from sinusitis. A 53-year-old Japanese man presented at our hospital with a headache. Computed tomography (CT) of the cranium and sinuses showed ethmoid and sphenoid sinusitis with no intracranial abnormalities. The patient was diagnosed with acute sinusitis and underwent antibiotic treatment. However, the symptoms deteriorated, and the patient came to our hospital again with consciousness disturbance. CT scan of the cranium and sinuses showed no improvement of sinusitis after antibiotic therapy and an epidural abscess emerged in the middle cranial fossa. Therefore, emergency craniotomy and endoscopic sinus fenestration were performed. Filamentous fungal elements were observed in both rhinorrhoea and epidural abscess. The symptoms improved after the operation and administration of liposomal amphotericin B. The clinical isolate was identified as S. commune by a molecular-based method. To our knowledge, this is the first report of epidural abscess due to this fungus. Although rare, clinicians should be aware that S. commune could be a causative agent of CNS infections."
0,Fungal Infections in Patients With Infected Pancreatic Necrosis and Pseudocysts: Risk Factors and Outcome.,"Fungal infections in patients with acute pancreatitis are common and potentially life threatening. Data on fungal pancreatic infections are inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify risk factors for fungal infection and to determine their impact on survival.This was a retrospective analysis of pathogen spectrum and outcome of infected pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts from 3 German hospitals from 2002 to 2016.A total of 187 fine-needle aspirations were performed in 113 patients. Fungal pancreatic infections, predominantly caused by Candida species, were identified in 52 patients (46%). Antibiotic treatment before fine-needle aspiration (84.6% vs 49.2%, P = 0.003) and the duration of therapy (9 vs 2 days, P = 0.024) identified patients at an increased risk of fungal infection. Patients with fungal pancreatic infections had a longer hospital stay (34 vs 14 days, P < 0.001), received intensive care treatment more often (55.8% vs 27.9%, P = 0.002), and had a lower 365-day survival (78.4 [SE, 6.6%] vs 95.0 [SE, 2.0%], P = 0.035) than patients with bacterial pancreatic infections only.Fungal infections are common in patients with infected pancreatic necrosis and pseudocysts and indicate patients with a higher risk of mortality in the long term."
0,Infections in Liver Disease.,"Infectious complications are common occurrences in end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Frequent infections precipitate decompensation of liver disease leading to acute or chronic liver failure, organ dysfunction, de-listing from transplant, and major morbidity and mortality. The spectrum of microorganisms has shifted with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains, which has major implications for both therapy and prophylaxis. Cirrhosis is often associated with an underlying noninfectious systemic inflammatory state that makes diagnosis of infections particularly challenging. Adequate resuscitation and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are pivotal to improved outcomes from infections in ESLD. "
0,"Bacterial, fungal and protozoan carbonic anhydrases as drug targets.","The carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1), a group of ubiquitously expressed metalloenzymes, are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes, as well as in the growth and virulence of pathogens belonging to bacteria, fungi and protozoa.CAs belonging to at least four genetic families, the ??-, ??-, ??- and ??-CAs, were discovered and characterized in many pathogens: i) Bacteria encode enzymes from one or more such families, which were investigated as potential drug targets. Inhibition of bacterial CAs by sulfonamides/phenol derivatives lead to inhibition of growth of the pathogen for Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella suis; ii) Fungi encode for ??- and ??-CAs, and inhibitors of the sulfonamide, thiol or dithiocarbamate type inhibited the growth of some of them (Malassezia globosa, Candida albicans, Crytpococcus neoformans, etc) in vivo; and iii) Protozoa encode ??-, ??- or ??-CAs. Sulfonamide, thiols and hydroxamates effectively killed such parasites (Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania donovani chagasi, Plasmodium falciparum) in vivo.None of the microorganism CAs is validated as drug targets as yet, but the inhibitors designed against many such enzymes showed interesting in vitro/in vivo results. By interfering with the activity of CAs from microorganisms, both pH homeostasis as well as crucial biosynthetic reactions are impaired, which lead to significant antiinfective effects, not yet exploited for obtaining pharmacological agents. As resistance to the clinically used antiinfectives is a serious healthcare problem worldwide, inhibition of parasite CAs may constitute an alternative approach for obtaining such agents with novel mechanisms of action."
0,Infections in composite tissue allograft recipients.,"This article summarizes infectious complications in recipients of facial and hand composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) and reviews infection prophylaxis practices. Infectious complications after CTA are common. In the early postoperative period, serious bacterial infections are more often reported in facial CTA recipients than in hand CTA recipients. Rejection and concomitant viral reactivation of herpes family viruses cause significant morbidity after the immediate postoperative period. Invasive fungal infection is an uncommon complication. Infection prophylaxis practices typically include early antibacterial prophylaxis during the perioperative period and cytomegalovirus, pneumocystis, and toxoplasma prophylaxis for several months after transplantation."
0,Granulocyte transfusions for preventing infections in people with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction.,"Despite modern antimicrobials and supportive therapy, bacterial and fungal infections are still major complications in people with prolonged disease-related or therapy-related neutropenia. Since the late 1990s there has been increasing demand for donated granulocyte transfusions to treat or prevent severe infections in people who lack their own functional granulocytes. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.To determine the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions compared with a control population not receiving this intervention for preventing all-cause mortality, mortality due to infection, and evidence of infection due to infection or due to any other cause in people with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil function.We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), theTransfusion Evidence Library (from 1980) and ongoing trial databases to April 20 2015.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing people receiving granulocyte transfusions to prevent the development of infection with a control group receiving no granulocyte transfusions. Neonates are the subject of another Cochrane review and were excluded from this review. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, but this review focuses on mortality, mortality due to infection and adverse events.We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria. One trial is still ongoing, leaving a total of 11 trials eligible involving 653 participants. These trials were conducted between 1978 and 2006 and enrolled participants from fairly comparable patient populations. None of the studies included people with neutrophil dysfunction. Ten studies included only adults, and two studies included children and adults. Ten of these studies contained separate data for each arm and were able to be critically appraised. One study re-randomised people and therefore quantitative analysis was unable to be performed.Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low to low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to many of the studies being at high risk of bias, and many of the outcome estimates being imprecise.All-cause mortality was reported for nine studies (609 participants). There was no difference in all-cause mortality over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (seven studies; 437 participants; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.36, very low-quality evidence).Mortality due to infection was reported for seven studies (398 participants). There was no difference in mortality due to infection over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (six studies; 286 participants; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44, very low-quality evidence).The number of people with localised or systemic bacterial or fungal infections was reported for nine studies (609 participants). There were differences between the granulocyte dose subgroups (test for subgroup differences P = 0.01). There was no difference in the number of people with infections over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not in the low-dose granulocyte group (< 1.0 x 10(10) granulocytes per day) (four studies, 204 participants; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.20; very low-quality evidence). There was a decreased number of people with infections over 30 days in the people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions in the intermediate-dose granulocyte group (1.0 x 10(10) to 4.0 x 10(10) granulocytes per day) (4 studies; 293 participants; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63, low-quality evidence).There was a decreased number of participants with bacteraemia and fungaemia in the participants receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (nine studies; 609 participants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.65, low-quality evidence).There was no difference in the number of participants with localised bacterial or fungal infection in the participants receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (six studies; 296 participants; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; very low-quality evidence).Serious adverse events were only reported for participants receiving granulocyte transfusions and donors of granulocyte transfusions.In people who are neutropenic due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy or a haematopoietic stem cell transplant, there is low-grade evidence that prophylactic granulocyte transfusions decrease the risk of bacteraemia or fungaemia. There is low-grade evidence that the effect of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions may be dose-dependent, a dose of at least 10 x 10(10) per day being more effective at decreasing the risk of infection. There is insufficient evidence to determine any difference in mortality rates due to infection, all-cause mortality, or serious adverse events."
0,Incidence of bacterial and fungal infections in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia patients younger than 65 yr treated with induction regimens including fludarabine: retrospective analysis of 224 cases.,"Infections are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). They primarily occur during the first course of induction chemotherapy and may increase the risk of leukaemia relapse, due to a significant delay in consolidation therapy. The intensification of induction chemotherapy and the use of non-conventional drugs such as fludarabine are considered responsible for the increased risk of infections.In this study, we retrospectively analysed the infections occurred in 224 newly diagnosed AML patients </=65 yr, consecutively treated between 1997 and 2002 with an induction regimen including fludarabine, arabinosyl cytosine and idarubicin, with or without etoposide (FLAI/FLAIE), in the context of three multicentric prospective trials (AML97, AML99, AML02).During the induction phase, 146 (65%) patients experienced fever of undetermined origin (FUO), 30 (13%) and 47 (21%) patients had Gram-negative and positive bacteremias, respectively, and 10 (4%) patients developed a probable/proven invasive fungal infection (IFI). The fatality rate for Gram-negative, Gram-positive bacteremias and probable/proven IFI was 10%, 8% and 60% respectively. During consolidation, 75 (35%) patients had FUO, 43 (20%) and 40 (19%) patients had Gram-negative and positive bacteremias, respectively, and 5 (2%) patients developed a probable/proven IFI. The fatality rate for Gram-negative, Gram-positive bacteremias and probable/proven IFI was 14%, 5% and 80% respectively. Interestingly, the overall incidence of microbiologically documented infections during induction was 38% and the incidence of probable/proven IFIs during the induction/consolidation programme was 7%. No infections caused by viruses or opportunistic pathogens were observed neither during induction, nor during consolidation.These data, although retrospectively collected, suggest that fludarabine-based chemotherapy is not associated with an increased incidence of infections, in particular IFIs, compared to conventional regimens commonly used for AML induction."
0,"Synergistic antimicrobial activity of Boswellia serrata Roxb. ex Colebr. (Burseraceae) essential oil with various azoles against pathogens associated with skin, scalp and nail infections.","Antimicrobials from natural sources have gained immense importance in recent times to combat the global challenge of antibiotic resistance. Essential oils are implicated in antimicrobial action against several species. Here, we have screened nine commercially available essential oils for their antimicrobial activity against organisms associated with skin, scalp and nail infections mainly Propionibacterium acnes, Malassezia spp., Candida albicans and Trichophyton spp. Among nine essential oils, Boswellia serrata essential oil demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity against all the micro-organisms and surprisingly it showed maximum activity against Trichophyton spp. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of B.??serrata oil indicates a major composition of ?? thujene, ?? cymene and sabinene. Additionally, B.??serrata oil was found to inhibit Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm, and its combination with azoles has shown synergistic activity against azole-resistant strain of C.??albicans. These broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities of B.??serrata oil will make it an ideal candidate for topical use.Eradication of skin and nail infections still remain a challenge and there are serious concerns regarding the recurrence of the diseases associated with these infections. Antimicrobials from plant sources are gaining importance in therapeutics because they encounter minimal challenges of emergence of resistance. We have demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of Boswellia serrata essential oil against micro-organisms involved in skin, scalp and nail infections, especially if it has shown favourable synergistic antifungal activity in combination with azoles against the azole-resistant Candida albicans strain. Thus, B.??serrata oil can be one of the plausible therapeutic agents for management of skin, scalp and nail infections."
0,[Management of biofilm-associated infections: what can we expect from recent research on biofilm lifestyles?].,"Biofilms are surface-associated microbial communities present in all environments. Although biofilms play important ecological roles, they also lead to negative or deleterious effects in industrial and medical settings. In the latter, high levels of antibiotic tolerance of bacterial biofilms developing on medical devices and during chronic infections determine the physiopathology of many healthcare-associated infections. Original approaches have been developed to avoid bacterial adhesion or biofilm development targetting specific mechanisms or pathways. We herein review recent data about biofilm lifestyle understanding and ways to fight against related infections."
0,Severe infections after single umbilical cord blood transplantation in adults with or without the co-infusion of CD34+ cells from a third-party donor: results of a multicenter study from the Grupo Espa??ol de Trasplante Hematopoy??tico (GETH).,"Umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) is an established alternative source of stem cells in the setting of unrelated transplantation. When compared with other sources, single-unit CBT (sCBT) is associated with a delayed hematologic recovery, which may lead to a higher infection-related mortality (IRM). Co-infusion with the sCBT of CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells from a third-party donor (TPD) (sCBT + TPDCD34+) has been shown to markedly accelerate leukocyte recovery, potentially reducing the IRM. However, to our knowledge, no comparative studies have focused on severe infections and IRM with these 2 sCBT strategies.A total of 148 consecutive sCBT (2000-2010, median follow-up 4.5 years) were included in a multicenter retrospective study to analyze the incidence and risk factors of IRM and severe viral and invasive fungal infections (IFIs). Neutrophil engraftment occurred in 90% of sCBT (n = 77) and 94% sCBT + TPDCD34+ (n = 71) recipients at a median of 23 and 12 days post transplantation, respectively (P < 0.01).The 4-year IRM was 24% and 20%, respectively (P = 0.7), with no differences at day +30 (5% and 4%, respectively) and day +100 (10% and 8%, respectively). In multivariate analysis early status of the underlying malignancy, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative recipient and high CD34+ cell content in the cord blood unit before cryostorage (???1.4 ?? 10(5) /kg) were protective of IRM. Among the causes of IRM, bacterial infections and IFIs were more common in sCBT (15% vs. 4%), while CMV disease and parasitic infections were more common in the sCBT + TPDCD34+ cohort (5% vs. 16%).These data show that sCBT supported with TPDCD34(+) cells results in much shorter periods of post-transplant leukopenia, but the short- and long-term rates of IRM were comparable to those of sCBT, presumably because immune recovery is equally delayed in both graft types."
0,Opportunistic Fungal Infections in Critical Care Units.,"Fungal infections are rare compared with bacterial infections, but they are on the increase in critical care units. Diagnosis can be difficult, resulting in increased mortality. Immunocompromised patients are at higher risk for fungal infections, including organ transplant, oncology, and HIV/AIDS patients. Fatigue and fever are common symptoms that require critical care nurses to remain vigilant in assessment to identify at-risk patients and promote use of timely cultures and appropriate treatments for fungal infections. Critical care nurses can contribute to decreasing risk for fungal infections by controlling glucose levels, decreasing the use of invasive lines, and preventing unnecessary antibiotic use."
0,Bacterial and Fungal Endophthalmitis.,"Endophthalmitis is a severe eye infection that may result in permanent loss of useful vision in the affected eye. Most cases are exogenous and occur as a complication of cataract surgery, an intravitreal injection, or penetrating ocular trauma. Endogenous endophthalmitis results from hematogenous seeding of the eye by bacteria or fungi, but bacteremia or fungemia may be transient and patients may present without symptoms of systemic infection. Nearly all endophthalmitis patients present with decreased vision, and some also have eye pain. Eye examination usually reveals a hypopyon and intraocular inflammation. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by cultures of the vitreous and/or aqueous or by blood cultures in some endogenous cases. Molecular diagnostic techniques have been used in research laboratories for pathogen identification in endophthalmitis and offer the possibility of rapid diagnosis, including in culture-negative cases. Intravitreal injection of antibiotics is the most important component of treatment; some cases also benefit from surgical debridement of the vitreous by a vitrectomy. The visual outcome depends partly on the pathogen: coagulase-negative staphylococcal endophthalmitis has a better prognosis than does streptococcal endophthalmitis, for example. Endophthalmitis is a medical emergency, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential for saving vision."

Part 1: bacterial, viral and fungal infections.","The purpose of this article is to review the imaging findings of various infections affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Barium examinations, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonography all play an important role in the diagnostic workup of gastrointestinal tract infections. Knowledge of differential diagnosis, sites of involvement, and typical imaging features of different infections can help in accurate diagnosis and guide treatment."
0,Amphibian chytridiomycosis outbreak dynamics are linked with host skin bacterial community structure.,"Host-associated microbes are vital for combatting infections and maintaining health. In amphibians, certain skin-associated bacteria inhibit the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), yet our understanding of host microbial ecology and its role in disease outbreaks is limited. We sampled skin-associated bacteria and Bd from Pyrenean midwife toad populations exhibiting enzootic or epizootic disease dynamics. We demonstrate that bacterial communities differ between life stages with few shared taxa, indicative of restructuring at metamorphosis. We detected a significant effect of infection history on metamorph skin microbiota, with reduced bacterial diversity in epizootic populations and differences in community structure and predicted function. Genome sequencing of Bd isolates supports a single introduction to the Pyrenees and reveals no association between pathogen genetics and epidemiological trends. Our findings provide an ecologically relevant insight into the microbial ecology of amphibian skin and highlight the relative importance of host microbiota and pathogen genetics in predicting disease outcome."
0,Management of infections in cirrhotic patients: report of a consensus conference.,"The statements produced by the consensus conference on infection in end-stage liver disease promoted by the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver, are here reported. The topics of epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patient with compensated and decompensated liver cirrhosis were reviewed by a scientific board of experts who proposed 26 statements that were graded according to level of evidence and strength of recommendation, and approved by an independent jury. Each topic was explored focusing on the more relevant clinical questions. By systematic literature search of available evidence, comparison and discussion of expert opinions, pertinent statements answering specific questions were presented and approved. Short comments were added to explain the basis for grading evidence particularly on case of controversial areas. "
0,Skin infections among US high school athletes: A national survey.,"Skin infections have long been a reported problem among high school athletes, particularly wrestlers. There has yet to be a national study describing the epidemiology of skin infections across multiple high school sports.We sought to report the epidemiology of skin infections among US high school athletes.High school sports-related skin infections resulting in time loss were reported by a convenience sample of US high schools from 2009/2010 through 2013/2014 via High School Reporting Information Online.During the study, 474 skin infections were reported among 20,858,781 athlete exposures, a rate of 2.27 per 100,000 athlete exposures. The largest number of skin infections occurred in wrestling (73.6%) followed by football (17.9%). The most common infections were bacterial (60.6%) and tinea (28.4%) infections. Body parts most often affected were the head/face (25.3%) followed by the forearm (12.7%).The study included only high schools with National Athletic Trainers' Association-affiliated athletic trainers, which may limit generalizability. However, using athletic trainers as data reporters improved data quality.Skin infections are an important subset of high school sports-related adverse events. An understanding of the epidemiology of sports-related skin infections should promote awareness and drive evidence-based prevention efforts."
0,Opportunistic and other infections in HIV-infected children in Latin America compared to a similar cohort in the United States.,"Opportunistic and other infections have declined since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in developed countries but few studies have addressed the impact of HAART in HIV-infected children from developing countries. This study examines the prevalence and incidence of opportunistic and other infections in Latin America during the HAART era. Vertically HIV-infected children enrolled in a cohort study between 2002 and 2007 were followed for the occurrence of 29 targeted infections. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed to calculate the prevalence of infections before enrollment and the incidence rates of opportunistic and other infections after enrollment. Comparisons were made with data from a U.S. cohort (PACTG 219C). Of the 731 vertically HIV-infected children 568 (78%) had at least one opportunistic or other infection prior to enrollment. The most prevalent infections were bacterial pneumonia, oral candidiasis, varicella, tuberculosis, herpes zoster, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. After enrollment, the overall incidence was 23.5 per 100 person-years; the most common infections (per 100 person-years) were bacterial pneumonia (7.8), varicella (3.0), dermatophyte infections (2.9), herpes simplex (2.5), and herpes zoster (1.8). All of these incidence rates were higher than those reported in PACTG 219C. The types and relative distribution of infections among HIV-infected children in Latin America in this study are similar to those seen in the United States but the incidence rates are higher. Further research is necessary to determine the reasons for these higher rates."

0,"Deep Fungal Infections, Blastomycosis-Like Pyoderma, and Granulomatous Sexually Transmitted Infections.","Granulomatous diseases are caused by multiple infectious and noninfectious causes. Deep fungal infections can present in the skin or extracutaneously, most commonly with lung manifestations. An Azole or amphotericin B is the universal treatment. Blastomycosis-like pyoderma is a clinically similar condition, which is caused by a combination of hypersensitivity and immunosuppression. Successful treatment has been reported with antibiotics and, more recently, the vitamin A analog, acitretin. Granuloma inguinale and lymphogranuloma venereum cause ulcerative genital lesions with a granulomatous appearance on histology. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommens treatment of these genital infections with doxycycline. "
0,"Temperature variation, bacterial diversity and fungal infection dynamics in the amphibian skin.","Host-associated bacterial communities on the skin act as the first line of defence against invading pathogens. Yet, for most natural systems, we lack a clear understanding of how temperature variability affects structure and composition of skin bacterial communities and, in turn, promotes or limits the colonization of opportunistic pathogens. Here, we examine how natural temperature fluctuations might be related to changes in skin bacterial diversity over time in three amphibian populations infected by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Our focal host species (Eleutherodactylus coqui) is a direct-developing frog that has suffered declines at some populations in the last 20??years, while others have not experienced any changes. We quantified skin bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity at four sampling time points, a period encompassing two seasons and ample variation in natural infections and environmental conditions. Despite the different patterns of infection across populations, we detected an overall increase in bacterial diversity through time, characterized by the replacement of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Increased frog body temperatures possibly allowed the colonization of bacteria as well as the recruitment of a subset of indicator OTUs, which could have promoted the observed changes in diversity patterns. Our results suggest that natural environmental fluctuations might be involved in creating opportunities for bacterial replacement, potentially attenuating pathogen transmission and thus contributing to host persistence in E.??coqui populations."
0,A Phase 2 study of L-asparaginase encapsulated in erythrocytes in elderly patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia: The GRASPALL/GRAALL-SA2-2008 study.,"The GRASPALL/GRAALL-SA2-2008 Phase II trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of L-asparaginase encapsulated within erythrocytes (GRASPA??) in patients?€?????€?55 years with Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Thirty patients received escalating doses of GRASPA?? on Day 3 and 6 of induction Phases 1 and 2. The primary efficacy endpoint was asparagine depletion?€?<?€?2 ??mol/L for at least 7 days. This was reached in 85 and 71% of patients with 100 and 150 IU/kg respectively but not with 50 IU/kg. Grade 3/4 infection, hypertransaminasemia, hyperbilirubinemia and deep vein thrombosis occurred in 77, 20, 7, and 7% of patients, respectively. No allergic reaction or clinical pancreatitis was observed despite 17% of Grade 3/4 lipase elevation. Anti-asparaginase antibodies were detected in 50% of patients and related to a reduction in the duration of asparagine depletion during induction Phase 2 without decrease of encapsulated L-asparaginase activity. Complete remission rate was 70%. With a median follow-up of 42 months, median overall survival was 15.8 and 9.7 months, in the 100 and 150 IU/kg cohorts respectively.The addition of GRASPA??, especially at the 100 IU/kg dose level, is feasible in elderly patients without excessive toxicity and associated with durable asparagine depletion.

0,Analysis of infections in the first 3-month after living donor liver transplantation.,"To identify factors related to serious postoperative bacterial and fungal infections in the first 3 mo after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).In the present study, the data of 207 patients from 2004 to 2011 were reviewed. The pre-, intra- and post-operative factors were statistically analyzed. All transplantations were approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Patients with definitely preoperative infections and infections within 48 h after transplantation were excluded from current study. All potential risk factors were analyzed using univariate analyses. Factors significant at a P < 0.10 in the univariate analyses were involved in the multivariate analyses. The diagnostic accuracy of the identified risk factors was evaluated using receiver operating curve.The serious bacterial and fungal infection rates were 14.01% and 4.35% respectively. Enterococcus faecium was the predominant bacterial pathogen, whereas Candida albicans was the most common fungal pathogen. Lung was the most common infection site for both bacterial and fungal infections. Recipient age older than 45 years, preoperative hyponatremia, intensive care unit stay longer than 9 d, postoperative bile leak and severe hyperglycemia were independent risk factors for postoperative bacterial infection. Massive red blood cells transfusion and postoperative bacterial infection may be related to postoperative fungal infection.Predictive risk factors for bacterial and fungal infections were indentified in current study. Pre-, intra- and post-operative factors can cause postoperative bacterial and fungal infections after LDLT."
0,"Epidemiology of visceral mycoses in autopsy cases in Japan: comparison of the data from 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2007 in Annual of Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan.","The data on visceral mycoses reported in the "" Annual of Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan "" were analyzed epidemiologically every four years from 1989 to 2005, and in 2007. The frequency rates of visceral mycoses dropped sharply between 1989 (4.5%) and 1994 (3.2%), but by 2001 had risen again and have remained (4.4-4.6%) generally stable since then. The predominant causative agents were Candida and Aspergillus. Although the rate of candidosis showed a gradual decrease, the rate of aspergillosis showed an increase by degrees. Furthermore, the rate of aspergillosis exceeded that of candidosis in 1994, and the difference in the rates between the two conditions apparently further increased until 2001. After 2005, however no changes in this difference were observed. For complicated infections, the incidence of coinfection with Aspergillus and Candida showed a decreasing, and that with Aspergillus and Zygomycetes showed an increasing tendency. Severe infections with Zygomycetes showed a clear increase from 57.4% in 1989 to 88.9% in 2007. Comparing underlying diseases with mycoses in 1989 and 2007, leukemia (including myelodysplastic syndrome) decreased from 26.1% to 18.8% and bacterial infections (including interstitial pneumonia) increased from 11.1% to 22.1%. By age, the highest frequency rate of mycoses was observed in the range of 60-79 years, and the frequency rate of exogenous fungal infections such as aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, zygomycosis and trichosporonosis showed an increasing trend in the less than one-year old group."
0,Role of extracellular polymeric substances in polymicrobial biofilm infections of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans modelled in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.,"Biofilms are formed by communities of microorganisms living in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix attached to a surface. When living in a biofilm microorganisms change phenotype and thus are less susceptible to antibiotic treatment and biofilm infections can become severe. The aim of this study was to determine if the presence of multikingdom microorganisms alters the virulence of a biofilm infection in a host organism. The coexistence of Candida albicans and Staphylococcus epidermidis in biofilm was examined in the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans. It was evaluated if the hyphal form of C. albicans and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) formed by S. epidermidis increases biofilm virulence. Survival assays were performed, where C. elegans nematodes were exposed to S. epidermidis and C. albicans. Single inoculation assays showed a decreased survival rate after 2 days following exposure, while dual inoculation assays showed that a clinical S. epidermidis strain together with C. albicans significantly increased the virulence and decreased nematode survival. EPS seem to interfere with the bacterial attachment to hyphae, since the EPS overproducing S. epidermidis strain was most virulent. The clinical S. epidermidis paired with C. albicans led to a severe infection in the nematodes resulting in reduced survival."
0,[Invasive mycoses and trauma].,"Perforating injury allows the dispersion of environmental fungi and fungal spores together with miniscule foreign bodies into traumatized tissue where they can multiply and cause invasive infection. Acute invasive fungal infection after open fractures is uncommon. The severity of the fungal infections depends on the type of injury (perforating, presence of foreign material), the body area and the general condition of the patient. Fungal infections of the immuncompetent host are generally localized within the dermis, invasion of the fascia, muscles and the bone is rare. Injury-related fungal infections of the immuncompromised host may lead to rapid invasion and generalization of the fungal infection. The following review will focus on the fungal infections after perforating injuries and open fractures including the invasive mycoses as a direct consequence of the trauma, post-traumatic fungal infections, tropical fungal infections (mycetoma), invasive fungal infections after near-drowning and nosocomial invasive fungal infections of the critically ill post-traumatic patient admitted to the intensive care unit."
0,Added value of multi-pathogen probe-based real-time PCR SeptiFast in the rapid diagnosis of bloodstream infections in patients with bacteraemia.,"The commercial multi-pathogen probe-based real-time PCR SeptiFast (SF) was evaluated as a rapid and complementing tool for the microbiological diagnosis of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in a series of 138 matched blood samples from 65 patients with bacteraemia, hospitalized in an intensive care unit, when antibiotics had already been administered. SF was positive in 32.6?€?% of the samples, whereas blood culture (BC) was positive in 21.7?€?% (P?€?<?€?0.05). SF identified more pathogens (11 versus 5; specificity, 90.7?€?%) and reduced the time of aetiological diagnosis, with a mean of 16.3 versus 55.4?€?h needed for BC (P?€?<?€?0.05). SF enabled appropriate pathogen-oriented therapy in 72?€?% (36/50) of the BSI group of patients on the basis of epidemiological data. According to our data, the use of SF provided important added value to BC, in terms of earlier aetiological diagnosis of BSIs, enabling pathogen-oriented therapy in patients receiving empirical antibiotic treatment."
0,Fungal Infections in Boston Keratoprosthesis Patients: Lessons Learned and Novel Developments on the Horizon.,"The Boston Keratoprosthesis (B-KPro) is a widely accepted modality of corneal restoration in eyes where traditional penetrating keratoplasty has little chance of success. It is the most commonly used keratoprosthesis worldwide. While the introduction of broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis has virtually eliminated cases of bacterial endophthalmitis, fungal colonization and infections are a growing concern. This review of the literature summarizes risk factors for fungal infections in KPro eyes, rates of fungal infection and colonization, clinical presentation, causative organisms, management, and outcomes. We also focus on current recommendations for antifungal prophylaxis, and highlight the role of translational research at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI, Boston, USA) with its aim of developing novel strategies for reducing rates of fungal infections in KPro patients.

0,Microbiologically documented infections in patients undergoing high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation for the treatment of light chain amyloidosis.,"Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis can be treated with high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM/SCT). Risk factors for infections may include hyposplenism, hypogammaglobulinemia, treatment-related neutropenia, melphalan-induced mucositis, and nosocomial exposures.A review of 493 patients with AL amyloidosis undergoing treatment with HDM/SCT from August 1994 to August 2009 was performed. The objectives were to determine the rate and types of infections following HDM/SCT, to identify factors associated with microbiologically documented infections, and to assess the contribution of infections to all-cause treatment-related mortality (TRM; defined as deaths within 100??days of SCT).Microbiologically documented infections after HDM/SCT occurred in 24% (n??=??119) of patients. TRM was 10% (n??=??48) overall, and 21% (n??=??25) in patients who had a documented infection. Thus, the relative risk of TRM in a patient with a documented infection was 3.42 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.02-5.79). Infections were caused by gram-positive bacteria in 51%, anaerobic bacteria in 16%, gram-negative bacteria in 13%, and fungi in 9% of cases. Serum creatinine >2??mg/dL was associated with increased risk of post-SCT infection (38% vs. 21%, P??=??0.0007) with an odds ratio of 2.27 (95% CI 1.40-3.68). No significant association for infection was found for age, gender, cardiac involvement, prior steroid therapy, dose of melphalan, multiorgan involvement, days to neutrophil engraftment, or dose of CD34??+?? cells infused.Serum creatinine >2??mg/dL is a risk factor for infections in patients with AL amyloidosis undergoing HDM/SCT. The relative risk of TRM in a patient with a documented infection was increased >3-fold. A broad spectrum of infections, similar to that in other SCT patients, is seen in this population in the early post-SCT period."
0,Executive summary: Prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections and other coinfections in HIV-infected patients: May 2015.,"Opportunistic infections continue to be a cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. They often arise because of severe immunosuppression resulting from poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy, failure of antiretroviral therapy, or unawareness of HIV infection by patients whose first clinical manifestation of AIDS is an opportunistic infection. The present article is an executive summary of the document that updates the previous recommendations on the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients, namely, infections by parasites, fungi, viruses, mycobacteria, and bacteria, as well as imported infections. The article also addresses immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. This document is intended for all professionals who work in clinical practice in the field of HIV infection. "
0,Skull-base osteomyelitis: fungal vs. bacterial infection.,"Skull-base osteomyelitis (SBO) occurs secondary to invasive bacterial and fungal infection. Distinguishing between fungal and bacterial aetiologies of SBO has significant therapeutic implications. An 18-year (1990-2007) retrospective review of patients with SBO presenting to Westmead Hospital was performed. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collated. Twenty-one patients (median age 58 years) with SBO were identified: ten (48%) had bacterial and 11 (52%) had fungal SBO. Diabetes mellitus (57%) and chronic otitis externa (33%) were the most frequent co-morbidities; immunosuppression was present in five cases (24%). Cranial nerve deficits occurred in ten (48%) patients. The commonest pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50% bacterial SBO) and a zygomycete (55% fungal SBO). Compared to bacterial SBO, fungal SBO was more frequently associated with underlying chronic sinusitis, sinonasal pain, facial/periorbital swelling and nasal stuffiness or discharge and the absence of purulent ear discharge (all p <0.05). Bacterial SBO was more frequently associated with deafness, ear pain or ear discharge (all p <0.05). Median time to presentation was longer in patients with bacterial SBO (26.3 weeks vs. 8.1 weeks, p 0.08). Overall 6-month survival was 88% (14/18 patients). All four deaths occurred in patients with fungal SBO. Immunosuppression was a risk factor for death (p <0.05). Early diagnostic sampling is recommended in patients at increased risk of fungal SBO to enable optimal antimicrobial and surgical management."
0,Increased Mortality Among Renal Transplant Patients With Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillus Infection.,"Renal transplantation is the most effective and preferred definite treatment option in patients with end-stage renal disease. Due to long-term immunesuppressive treatment, renal transplant recipients become vulnerable to opportunistic infections, especially to fungal infections.This was a single-center, retrospective observational study of 438 patients who underwent renal transplantation between 2010 and 2016.Thirty-eight renal transplant recipients who had lower respiratory tract infection with median age of 41.5 years were evaluated for invasive pulmonary aspergillus (IPA). Of these, 52.6% were female and 84.2% had living donors. Eleven of 38 lower respiratory patients were found to have IPA infection, 5 with proven infection. Compared to patients who did not have fungal pulmonary infection, patients with invasive aspergillus were older and had high fever, galactomannan levels, and leukocyte counts. Mortality was also higher in those patients. Having fever at the baseline and IPA infection was significantly associated with mortality in univariate analysis and remained related in multivariate model after adjustment for age, gender, and fever.Invasive pulmonary aspergillus infection is highly associated with increased mortality rates in renal transplant patients. Fungal pulmonary infections in immune-suppressed patients should be diagnosed and treated immediately in order to avoid the life-threatening complications and may greatly improve prognosis."
0,Duplex DNA-Invading ??-Modified Peptide Nucleic Acids Enable Rapid Identification of Bloodstream Infections in Whole Blood.,"Bloodstream infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Early and targeted antimicrobial intervention is lifesaving, yet current diagnostic approaches fail to provide actionable information within a clinically viable time frame due to their reliance on blood culturing. Here, we present a novel pathogen identification (PID) platform that features the use of duplex DNA-invading ??-modified peptide nucleic acids (??PNAs) for the rapid identification of bacterial and fungal pathogens directly from blood, without culturing. The PID platform provides species-level information in under 2.5 hours while reaching single-CFU-per-milliliter sensitivity across the entire 21-pathogen panel. The clinical utility of the PID platform was demonstrated through assessment of 61 clinical specimens, which showed >95% sensitivity and >90% overall correlation to blood culture findings. This rapid ??PNA-based platform promises to improve patient care by enabling the administration of a targeted first-line antimicrobial intervention.Bloodstream infections continue to be a major cause of death for hospitalized patients, despite significant improvements in both the availability of treatment options as well their application. Since early and targeted antimicrobial intervention is one of the prime determinants of patient outcome, the rapid identification of the pathogen can be lifesaving. Unfortunately, current diagnostic approaches for identifying these infections all rely on time-consuming blood culture, which precludes immediate intervention with a targeted antimicrobial. To address this, we have developed and characterized a new and comprehensive methodology, from patient specimen to result, for the rapid identification of both bacterial and fungal pathogens without the need for culturing. We anticipate broad interest in our work, given the novelty of our technical approach combined with an immense unmet need."

In Mexico there are not national statistics to identify the main microorganisms that cause a nosocomial infection.It was conducted an analysis of all the culture results of the nosocomial infections reported by the Sistema de Vigilancia Epidemiol??gica Hospitalaria (Epidemiological Surveillance System) of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social during the year 2013. The most frequent and relevant microorganisms were reported.48 377 results from cultures of nosocomial infections were studied. Of these 13 207 (27.3 %) were from 25 high specialty medical units and 35 170 (72.6 %) from 197 second level medical units. The most frequently isolated microorganism was Escherichia coli with 8192 results (16.9 %), followed by the group of Coagulase-negative Staphylococci with 6771 cultures (14 %) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with 5275 results (19.9 %). Slight differences between levels of care and specialized hospitals were observed.This study identifies the Escherichia coli, the group of Coagulase-negative Staphylococci and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the main microorganisms to prevent."
0,Infections occurring during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in adult patients.,"The application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in adults has been increasing, but infections occurring during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use are rarely described.We retrospectively analyzed the prospectively collected data on nosocomial infection surveillance of 334 patients aged 16 years or more undergoing their first extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for more than 48 hours at a university hospital from 1996 to 2007 for respiratory (20.4%) and cardiac (79.6%) support.During a total of 2559 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation days, 55 episodes of infections occurred in 45 patients (13.5%), including 38 bloodstream (14.85 per 1000 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation days), 6 surgical site, 4 respiratory tract, 3 urinary tract, and 4 other infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (16.7%) and Candida species (14.6%) were the predominant blood isolates. In stepwise logistic regression analysis, longer duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use (odds ratio 1.003; 95% confidence interval, 1.001-1.005; P??=??.004), mechanical complications (odds ratio, 4.849; 95% confidence interval, 1.569-14.991; P??=??.006), autoimmune disease (odds ratio, 6.997; 95% confidence interval, 1.541-31.766; P??=??.012), and venovenous mode (odds ratio, 4.473; 95% confidence interval, 1.001-19.977; P??=??.050) were independently associated with a higher risk for infections during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use. Overall in-hospital mortality was 68.3%, and its independent risk factors included older age (odds ratio, 1.037; 95% confidence interval, 1.021-1.054; P??<??.001), neurologic complications (odds ratio, 51.153; 95% confidence interval, 6.773-386.329; P??<??.001), and vascular complications (odds ratio, 1.922; 95% confidence interval, 1.112-3.320; P??<??.001), but not infections during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use.Bloodstream infection was the most common infection during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use. Duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, mechanical complications, autoimmune disease, and??venovenous mode seemed to be independently associated with infections."
0,A comprehensive review of the diagnosis and management of prosthetic joint infections in the absence of positive cultures.,"The diagnosis and management of prosthetic joint infections (PJI) with negative cultures remains an enigma without clear definitions and guidelines for its management. In contrast, the literature offers guidelines to the diagnosis and management of culture positive prosthetic joint infections as noted in both the infectious disease literature and the orthopedic literature. This paper outlines the current state of knowledge of PJI with negative cultures and summarizes the recommendations for the work up and management of this condition. In addition, we propose a simple algorithm that clinicians may find useful for the management of PJI with negative cultures. This algorithm has not been validated with data at this point, but can be applied to practice to help direct the management and diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections in the absence of positive cultures.

0,Role of fine needle aspiration biopsy cytology in the diagnosis of infections.,"The role of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) cytology in diagnosing infections has expanded due to the increase in the number of immune compromised patients and the increasing role of FNAB in the developing world where infection is a major cause of illness. FNAB has become the first procedural test in cases where the clinical and imaging findings suggest an infectious lesion or where there is a differential diagnosis of infection or metastatic or primary tumor. This applies to FNAB of palpable or image directed or deep seated lesions accessed by EUS and EBUS. This article details a recommended approach and technique for FNAB of infectious lesions, and discusses the role of rapid on site evaluation and the application of ancillary testing including the rapidly expanding array of molecular tests based on FNAB material. The utility of recognizing suppurative and granulomatous infectious patterns in FNAB direct smears, and the specific cytomorphological features on routine Papanicolaou and Giemsa stains and on special stains of FNAB smears is described for a large number of bacterial, fungal, viral, parasitic, and protozoan infections. The role of cytopathologists is to now train cytopathologists in sufficient numbers to provide FNAB services, teach trainee cytopathologists and cytotechnologists, and to encourage our clinical colleagues to use FNAB in the diagnosis of infections and other lesions to the benefit of patients and the medical system.

0,Prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections and other coinfections in HIV-infected patients: May 2015.,"Despite the huge advance that antiretroviral therapy represents for the prognosis of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), opportunistic infections (OIs) continue to be a cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. OIs often arise because of severe immunosuppression resulting from poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy, failure of antiretroviral therapy, or unawareness of HIV infection by patients whose first clinical manifestation of AIDS is an OI. The present article updates our previous guidelines on the prevention and treatment of various OIs in HIV-infected patients, namely, infections by parasites, fungi, viruses, mycobacteria, and bacteria, as well as imported infections. The article also addresses immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. "
0,Factors associated with specific uropathogens in catheter-associated urinary tract infection: developing a clinical prediction model.,"To identify characteristics associated with particular groups of uropathogens in catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI) and to develop clinical prediction rules for identifying these groups.Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were analysed from patients with CA-UTI. Infections were categorized into enteric Gram-negative rods, nonfermenters, Gram-positive cocci and fungal. Variables were analysed using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses, and were used to develop clinical prediction rules.A total of 492 patients were included in the study. Candida species were the most common uropathogens (30.7%), followed by enterococci (17.3%), Escherichia coli (12.0%), Pseudomonas spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella spp. (7.9%) and staphylococci (6.5%). Clinical prediction rules for the bacterial uropathogenic groups showed poor-to-fair discriminatory power, with sensitivities of <40% and specificities of >90%. However, clinical prediction rules showed good discriminatory power for fungal infections, with a sensitivity of 67.3% and a specificity of 78.1%.Clinical prediction rules developed for identifying specific groups of bacterial uropathogens in patients with CA-UTI had a low sensitivity, whereas those for fungal infections showed good discriminatory power. Further studies to develop more refined and sensitive tools for predicting specific bacterial uropathogens in CA-UTI are warranted."
0,Safety and Efficacy of Infliximab Therapy in the Setting of Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease.,"Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment; however, less than one-half of patients achieve durable remission. Studies suggest that TNF-??, a cytokine released from the bone marrow during conditioning, is involved in the pathogenesis of aGVHD. We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of anti-TNF-?? therapy with infliximab in 35 patients with steroid refractory (SR) aGVHD. Infliximab was administered intravenously at 10?€?mg/kg for a median of 4 doses (range, 1 to 6) on a weekly basis. The overall response rates were 40% (17% complete response [CR], 23% partial response [PR]) at 4 weeks, 23% (9% CR, 14% PR) at 8 weeks, and 17% (all CR) at 12 weeks. Twenty-nine (83%) patients had infectious complications within 12 weeks of initiation of infliximab. These infections included 40 bacterial infections, 6 invasive fungal infections, and 5 viral reactivations. Twelve patients (34%) died secondary to infections. Overall survival at 12 weeks and 6 months from the start of infliximab therapy was 37% (13 of 35) and 17% (6 of 35), respectively; with most deaths secondary to complications from GVHD and infections. In conclusion; the use of infliximab therapy in patients with SR-aGVHD is associated with a modest poorly sustained response along with a heightened risk of severe infections. Future studies with more effective and less toxic therapies are needed for these patients."
0,[Microbial spectrum in surgical infections based on a microbiological routine monitoring over the 10-year period from 1995 to 2004].,"Infections belong to the most frequent and dangerous complications in surgery. In addition to the medical aspects, these infections may have a significant impact on the costs and the overall economic efficacy of medical treatment under the present circumstances of DRG.A systematic, prospective collection and retrospective evaluation of all consecutive microbiological analyses in specimens from the 3 medical floors (except the ICU) of the Department of Surgery at the University Hospital, Magdeburg (Germany) was performed in 1995, 2002 and 2004 to characterise i) the 10-year course (1995 vs. 2004) and ii) possible alterations due to changes in the previously existing pavillon system (2002 vs. 2004).The microbial spectrum was determined in the 3 most frequent specimen types (blood culture, urine sample, wound swab) including number and percentage of the single microbial groups such as gram-positive and gram-negative Enterobacteriae, pseudomonades and fungi. In addition, the antibiotic resistance of selected microbes was analysed. The primary data were registered in a database and evaluated according to the various questions.Overall, 2 979 microbes were identified in 1995 (2002, 1 338; 2004, 915). On comparing 1995 with 2004, the percentage of gram-positive microbes did not change (50.5 vs. 50.3 %), whereas the percentage of gram-negative enterobacteriae increased: 37.4 vs. 29.1 %. The percentage of detected fungi was only half of that in 1995: 6.2 vs. 12.2 %. In blood cultures, the Klebsiella spp. portion in the group of gram-negative enterobacteriae distinctly increased: 29.6 vs. 18.8 %. While in 2004, MRSA was found in 24.4 % of all detected Staphylococcus aureus strains in swab specimens amounting to a considerable increase compared to 2002 (17.6 %), in 1995, MRSA was not isolated at all in this material. In the fungi group, there was a decrease of the Candida albicans portion vs. the non-C. albicans strains, which was associated with an increasing resistance against fluconazol. This requires treatment with caspofungin, resulting in increased costs vs. those necessary for fluconazol treatment.A systematic, microbiological, long-term monitoring is indispensable since i) microbial detection plays a growing role to include the various types of infections in the spectrum of diagnosis for DRG, ii) alterations of the microbial spectrum can only be detected through a long-term observation period (MRSA, fungi) and iii) simultaneously developing antibiotic resistances can be determined (MRSA, ESBL strains in Enterobacteriae, fluconazol-resistant fungi). This can have an infectious, biological, hygienic and cost-determining as well as a health policy relevance among others, with considerable additional costs (e. g., isolation of patients, cost-intensive substitutional medication) with necessary reimbursement."
0,Postoperative bacterial/fungal infections: a challenging problem in critically ill patients after abdominal surgery.,"Critically ill patients after extended surgical procedures are at high risk for postoperative infections. The overall incidence of sepsis increased constantly over the last decade, whereas sepsis-related mortality decreased, due to new intensive care options. After extended intra-abdominal surgery the abdomen is the predominant focus of sepsis, followed by respiratory tract infections. Unspecific clinical signs lead to the diagnosis of postoperative sepsis. Early focus identification by clinical, laboratory and radiologic examination is of major importance for a promising therapy, followed by immediately initiated procedures for source control and an adequate anti-infective drug therapy. For nosocomial sepsis, the use of antimicrobial regimens with extended spectra and potent activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens are warranted. Fungal infections play a great role for immunocompromized patients, e.g. after solid organ transplantation or under chronic corticoid therapy. An increasing incidence of multi-drug resistance in bacterial and fungal isolates has been observed in the last years. This is becoming a growing problem also for critically ill patients after abdominal surgery. Standardized treatment protocols including supportive and adjunctive therapy and the use of modern anti-infective agents may lead to a decrease in postoperative mortality due to sepsis."
0,Increased presepsin levels are associated with the severity of fungal bloodstream infections.,"Presepsin is a widely recognized biomarker for sepsis. However, little is known about the usefulness of presepsin in invasive fungal infection. The aim of this study was to determine the plasma levels of presepsin in fungal bloodstream infections and to investigate whether it reflects the disease severity, similar to its utility in bacterial infections.We prospectively measured presepsin in plasma samples from participants with fungemia from April 2016 to December 2017. The associations of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and presepsin concentrations with the severity of fungemia were statistically analyzed. In vitro assay was performed by incubating Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and lipopolysaccharide to whole blood cells collected from healthy subjects; after 3 h, the presepsin concentration was measured in the supernatant and was compared among the bacteria, fungi, and LPS groups.Presepsin was increased in 11 patients with fungal bloodstream infections. Serial measurement of presepsin levels demonstrated a prompt decrease in 7 patients in whom treatment was effective, but no decrease or further increase in the patients with poor improvement. Additionally, presepsin concentrations were significantly correlated with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (r = 0.89, p < 0.001). In vitro assay with co-incubation of C. albicans and human whole blood cells indicated that the viable cells of C. albicans caused an increase in presepsin, as seen with E. coli.Plasma presepsin levels increased in patients with fungal bloodstream infection, with positive association with the disease severity. Presepsin could be a useful biomarker of sepsis secondary to fungal infections."
0,Very late onset infections in the neonatal intensive care unit.,"We sought to determine the risk factors, incidence, and mortality of very late onset bacterial infection (blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid culture positive occurring after day of life 120) in preterm infants.A retrospective observational cohort study of all very low birth weight infants cared for between day of life 120 and 365 in 292 neonatal intensive care units in the United States from 1997 to 2008.We identified 3918 infants who were hospitalized beyond 120 days of life. Of these, 1027 (26%) were evaluated with at least 1 culture (blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid), and 276 (27%) of the evaluated infants had 414 episodes of culture-positive infection. Gram-positive organisms caused most of the infections (48%). The risk of death was higher in infants with positive cultures (odds ratio; 10.5, 95% confidence interval [7.2-15.5]) or negative cultures (4.8, [3.5-6.7]) compared to infants that were never evaluated with a culture (p<0.001). Mortality was highest with fungal infections (8/24, 33%) followed by Gram-positive cocci (40/142, 28%).Important predictive risk factors for early and late onset sepsis (birth weight and gestational age) did not contribute to risk of developing very late onset infection. Evaluation for infection (whether positive or negative) was a significant risk factor for death. GPC and fungal infections were associated with high mortality."
0,Detrimental Association of Hypogammaglobulinemia With Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction and Death Is Not Mitigated by On-Demand Immunoglobulin G Replacement After Lung Transplantation.,"Hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG), immunoglobulin G (IgG) <700 mg/dL, is associated with infections, chronic lung allograft dysfunction, and death following lung transplantation. This study evaluates the use of on-demand intravenous IgG in lung transplant recipients with HGG.This single-center retrospective cohort study of adult lung recipients evaluated 3 groups, no, untreated (u), or treated (t) HGG at first IgG administration or a matched time posttransplant. Primary outcome was freedom from allograft dysfunction. Secondary outcomes included development of advanced dysfunction, rejection, infection burden, and mortality.Recipients included 484 (no HGG: 76, uHGG: 192, tHGG: 216). Freedom from chronic allograph dysfunction was highest in the non-HGG group 2 years post-enrollment (no HGG 77.9% vs uHGG 56.4% vs tHGG 52.5%; P = .002). Freedom from advanced dysfunction was significantly different 2 years post-enrollment (no HGG 90.5% vs uHGG 84.7% vs tHGG 75.4%; P = .017). Patients without HGG and those with uHGG had less mortality at 2 years post-enrollment (no HGG 84.2% vs uHGG 81.3% vs tHGG 64.8%; P < .001). Gram-negative pneumonias occurred more often in the tHGG group ( P = .02).Development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, patient survival, rejection burden, and key infectious outcomes in lung transplant recipients were still problematic in the context of on-demand IgG therapy. Prospective studies are warranted."
0,Risk factors and outcomes of fungal ventricular-assist device infections.,"Infection is a common complication of ventricular-assist devices (VADs) and is associated with rehospitalization, thromboembolic events, VAD malfunction, delay in heart transplantation, and a high mortality rate. The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency of fungal VAD infections and assess various risk factors and their effects on mortality as compared with bacterial VAD infections.We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with infected VADs at a single tertiary care center. The frequency, risk factors, and outcomes of fungal versus bacterial VAD infections were compared.Of the 300 patients who received a VAD, 108 (36%) developed VAD infection, including 85 bacterial and 23 fungal infections. Most common bacterial causes of infection were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, and Pseudomonas aeuruginosa. The most common fungal etiologic agent was Candida albicans. Only the use of total parenteral nutrition was associated with the development of a fungal VAD infection in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 6.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.71-28.16; P=.007). Patients who experienced fungal VAD infection were less likely to be cured (17.4% vs 56.3%; P=.001) and had greater mortality (91% vs 61%; P=.006), compared with those who experienced bacterial VAD infection.Fungi were responsible for approximately one-fifth of VAD infections and were associated with a mortality rate of 91%. Restriction of total parenteral nutrition use is essential in decreasing the rate of fungal VAD infection. Trials are needed for investigating the use of echinocandins or lipid formulations of amphotericin B for prevention and/or treatment of fungal VAD infection."
0,"Spontaneous fungal peritonitis: Epidemiology, current evidence and future prospective.","Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a complication of ascitic patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD); spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) is a complication of ESLD less known and described. ESLD is associated to immunodepression and the resulting increased susceptibility to infections. Recent perspectives of the management of the critically ill patient with ESLD do not specify the rate of isolation of fungi in critically ill patients, not even the antifungals used for the prophylaxis, neither optimal treatment. We reviewed, in order to focus the epidemiology, characteristics, and, considering the high mortality rate of SFP, the use of optimal empirical antifungal therapy the current literature. "
0,Endemic infections in Southeast Asia provide new insights to the phenotypic spectrum of primary immunodeficiency disorders.,"Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) are rare genetic diseases of the immune system. With improving awareness of PIDs among clinicians, the number of patients diagnosed with PIDs is rising rapidly in Southeast Asia. However, delayed diagnosis remains common and adversely affects the prognosis of these patients. In this review, we provide simple phenotypic approach to the diagnosis of PIDs based on pattern recognition. Through multi-centered collaborative studies in the Asian Primary Immunodeficiency Network (APID), we present unique patterns of infectious diseases associated with PIDs in Southeast Asia, including BCG disease, tuberculosis, melioidosis, Penicillium marneffei and Chromobacterium violaceum infections. These initial observations suggest the possibility of utilizing these infections that rarely affect normal healthy children as 'indicators' for PIDs, which is of particular relevance for clinicians working in Southeast Asia.

0,"Postoperative infections after cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis: proposal and results from a prospective protocol study of prevention, surveillance and treatment.","The incidence of infectious complications due to several contributory causes is particularly elevated and life-threatening in patients undergoing peritonectomy and HIPEC procedure for peritoneal carcinomatosis. Following a previous experience, we started a prospective protocol study of preoperative screening, perioperative prophylaxis and postoperative surveillance and treatment. A total of 111 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of various origin underwent CRS with HIPEC between April 2004 and December 2012. The group was divided into a pilot group of 30 patients (04/04 to 05/08) and a main group of 81 patients (06/08 to 12/12). Overall postoperative morbidity rate was 44%, with 35.8% of symptomatic infections. No post-operative mortality was observed. Microorganisms were isolated in 24 patients (80.0%) in the first group and 54 (66.7%) in the second. They were symptomatic in 18 cases (75.0%) and 25 (46.3%) cases respectively. In addition, 7 invasive candidosis were recorded (25.9%). Colon resection (P??=??0.01) and duration of surgery (P??=??0.0008) were associated with infection at logistic regression model. Concerning symptomatic infections, only Infection Risk Index (P??=??0.009) showed significance at multivariate analysis. Despite a significant incidence of infectious complications, establishment of a prevention, surveillance and treatment protocol lead to a zero mortality rate in the observed patients of our experience. Owing to the obtained results, we suggest the use of a standardized protocol for the prevention, monitoring and treatment in all patients enrolled for cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. "
0,Human rhinovirus infections of the lower respiratory tract in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are a common cause of upper respiratory infection (URI) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients; yet, their role in lower respiratory illness is not well understood.We performed a retrospective chart review of HSCT recipients with HRV infection from the time molecular detection methods were implemented at our institution in 2008. Factors associated with proven or possible HRV pneumonia at the first HRV detection were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. We then characterized all episodes of proven and possible HRV pneumonia from the initial HRV infection through a 1-year follow-up period.Between 2008 and 2011, 63 HSCT recipients had ???1 documented HRV infections. At first HRV detection, 36 (57%) patients had HRV URI and 27 (43%) had proven or possible HRV pneumonia; in multivariate analysis, hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio [OR] 9.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-71.7; P??=??0.03) and isolation of respiratory co-pathogen(s) (OR 24.2, 95% CI 2.0-288.4; P??=??0.01) were independently associated with pneumonia. During the study period, 22 patients had 25 episodes of proven HRV pneumonia. Fever (60%), cough (92%), sputum production (61%), and dyspnea (60%) were common symptoms. Fifteen (60%) episodes demonstrated bacterial (n??=??7), fungal (n??=??5), or viral (n??=??3) co-infection. Among the remaining 10 (40%) cases of HRV monoinfection, patients' oxygen saturations ranged from 80% to 97% on ambient air, and computed tomography scans showed peribronchiolar, patchy, ground glass infiltrates.HRV pneumonia is relatively common after HSCT and frequently accompanied by bacterial co-infection. As use of molecular assays for respiratory viral diagnosis becomes widespread, HRV will be increasingly recognized as a significant cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts."
0,Bacterial and fungal biofilm infections.,"Biofilms are communal structures of microorganisms encased in an exopolymeric coat that form on both natural and abiotic surfaces and have been associated with a variety of persistent infections that respond poorly to conventional antibiotic chemotherapy. Biofilm infections of certain indwelling medical devices by common pathogens such as staphylococci are not only associated with increased morbidity and mortality but are also significant contributors to the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance traits in the nosocomial setting. Current treatment paradigms for biofilm-associated infections of semipermanent indwelling devices typically involve surgical replacement of the device combined with long-term antibiotic therapy and incur high health care costs. This review summarizes the existing data relating to the nature, prevalence, and treatment of biofilm-associated infections and highlights experimental approaches and therapies that are being pursued toward more effective treatments."
0,Late-onset bloodstream infections in hospitalized term infants.,"The epidemiology and incidence of late-onset blood stream infections (BSIs) in premature infants have been described, but studies describing late-onset BSI in term infants are sparse. We sought to describe the pathogens, incidence, risk factors and mortality of late-onset BSI in hospitalized term infants.A cohort study was conducted of infants ???37 weeks gestational age and ???120 days of age discharged from Pediatrix Medical Group neonatal intensive care units from 1997 to 2010. We examined all cultures obtained from day of life 4-120 and used multivariable regression to assess risk factors for late-onset BSI.We found a total of 206,019 infants cared for between day of life 4 and 120, and the incidence of late-onset BSI was 2.7/1000 admissions. We identified Gram-positive organisms in 64% of the cultures and Gram-negative organisms in 26%. We found a decreased risk of late-onset BSI in infants with the following characteristics: small for gestational age, delivery by Cesarean, antenatal antibiotic use and discharged in the later years of the study. Late-onset BSI increased the risk of death after controlling for confounders [odds ratio 8.43 (95% confidence interval 4.42-16.07)].Our data highlight the importance of late-onset BSI in hospitalized term infants. We identified Gram-positive organisms as the most common pathogen, and late-onset BSI was an independent risk factor for death."
0,[Risk factors of invasive fungal infections in patients admitted to non- hematological oncology department and pediatric intensive care unit].,"To determine risk factors of invasive fungal infections (IFI) in patients admitted to non-hematological oncology department and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), in order to improve diagnostic level of invasive fungal infections.We retrospectively assessed 85 hospitalized pediatric patients with invasive fungal infections in Beijing Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University from Jan.2007 to Nov.2012. All the cases were either from non-hematological oncology department or the PICU.We reviewed risk factors of invasive fungal infections.Among 85 patients, 42 had invasive candida infection, 20 invasive aspergillus infection, 21 cryptococcus infection, 1 Histoplasma capsulatum infection and 1 Mucor mucedo infection.In the 42 patients with invasive candida infection, 5 were young infants, 3 had combined immunodeficiency, 1 cellular immunodeficiency, 25 secondary infection due to long term use of corticosteroids and/or combined use of more than 2 kinds of antibiotics with primary disease, 5 prior intestinal tract surgery or chronic diarrheal disease, 1 reflux gastritis.In the 20 patients with invasive aspergillosis infection, 10 patients had chronic granulomatous disease, 5 long term use of corticosteroids ??? 1 month, 3 long term use of corticosteroids and combined use of more than 2 kinds of antibiotics, 2 had no apparent host factors.In the 21 patients with cryptococcus infection, 2 patients had used corticosteroids ??? 1 month, 2 had immunodeficiency mainly for lack of antibodies, while others had no apparent host factors. The child with Mucor mucedo infection had diabetes mellitus. And the one with Histoplasma capsulatum infection had immunodeficiency.High risk factors for IFI in patients admitted to non-hematological oncology department and PICU are primary immunodeficiency disease and long term use of corticosteroids and/or long term combined use of more than 2 kinds of antibiotics. Besides, young infant is also a high risk factor for invasive candida infection. Most of the cryptococcus infections and certain aspergillosis had no obvious host factors."
0,Confirmed Transmission of Bacterial or Fungal Infection to Kidney Transplant Recipients from Donated After Cardiac Death (DCD) Donors in China: A Single-Center Analysis.,"BACKGROUND We aimed to investigate blood and urine cultures of donated after cardiac death (DCD) donors and report the cases of confirmed (proven/probable) transmission of bacterial or fungal infection from donors to kidney recipients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-eight DCD donors between 2010 and 2016 were included. Sixty-one DCD donors underwent blood cultures and 22 episodes of bacteremias developed in 18 donors. Forty-three donors underwent urine cultures and 14 donors experienced 17 episodes of urinary infections. RESULTS Seven of 154 (4.5%) kidney recipients developed confirmed donor-derived bacterial or fungal infections. Inappropriate use of antibiotics in donor was a risk factor for donor-derived infection (p=0.048). The use of FK506 was more frequent in recipients without donor-derived infection than those with donor-derived infection (p=0.033). Recipients with donor-derived infection were associated with higher mortality and graft loss (42.9% and 28.6%, respectively), when compared with those without donor-derived infection (4.8% each). Three kidney recipients with donor-derived infection died; one death was due to multi-organ failure caused by Candida albicans, and two were related to rupture of the renal artery; two of them did not receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy after infection. CONCLUSIONS Our kidney recipients showed high occurrence rates of donor-derived infection. Recipients with donor-derived infection were associated with higher mortality and graft loss than those without donor-derived infection. The majority of recipients with donor-derived infection who died did not receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy after infection."
0,Liposomal vaccine formulations as prophylactic agents: design considerations for modern vaccines.,"Vaccinology is one of the most important cornerstones in modern medicine, providing better quality of life. The human immune system is composed of innate and adaptive immune processes that interplay when infection occurs. Innate immunity relies on pathogen-associated molecular patterns which are recognized by pathogen recognition receptors localized in antigen presenting cells. After antigen processing and presentation, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell polarization occurs, further leading to B cell and CD8<sup>+</sup> activation and humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses. Liposomes are being employed as vaccine technologies and their design is of importance to ensure proper immune responses. Physicochemical parameters like liposome size, charge, lamellarity and bilayer fluidity must be completely understood to ensure optimal vaccine stability and efficacy. Liposomal vaccines can be developed to target specific immune cell types for the induction of certain immune responses. In this review, we will present promising liposomal vaccine approaches for the treatment of important viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections (including tuberculosis, TB). Cationic liposomes are the most studied liposome types due to their enhanced interaction with the negatively charged immune cells. Thus, a special section on the cationic lipid dimethyldioctadecylammonium and TB is also presented."
0,Epidemiology and outcome of infections in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus-coinfected liver transplant recipients: a FIPSE/GESIDA prospective cohort study.,"Information about infections unrelated to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected liver recipients is scarce. The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics, time of onset, and outcomes of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected orthotopic liver transplant recipients and to identify risk factors for developing severe infections. We studied 84 consecutive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who underwent liver transplantation at 17 sites in Spain between 2002 and 2006 and were followed until December 2009. The median age was 42 years, and 76% were men. The median follow-up was 2.6 years (interquartile range = 1.25-3.53 years), and 54 recipients (64%) developed at least 1 infection. Thirty-eight (45%) patients had bacterial infections, 21 (25%) had cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections (2 had CMV disease), 13 (15%) had herpes simplex virus infections, and 16 (19%) had fungal infections (7 cases were invasive). Nine patients (11%) developed 10 opportunistic infections with a 44% mortality rate. Forty-three of 119 infectious episodes (36%) occurred in the first month after transplantation, and 53 (45%) occurred after the sixth month. Thirty-six patients (43%) had severe infections. Overall, 36 patients (43%) died, and the deaths were related to severe infections in 7 cases (19%). Severe infections increased the mortality rate almost 3-fold [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-5.8]. Independent factors for severe infections included a pretransplant Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score >15 (HR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.70-7.1), a history of AIDS-defining events before transplantation (HR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.9-8.6), and non-tacrolimus-based immunosuppression (HR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.3-4.8). In conclusion, the rates of severe and opportunistic infections are high in HIV/HCV-coinfected liver recipients and especially in those with a history of AIDS, a high MELD score, or non-tacrolimus-based immunosuppression."
0,Identification of causative organism in cardiac implantable electronic device infections.,"The causative organism in cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infection is usually diagnosed with the cultures from blood, removed leads, and/or infected pocket material. The cultured organism, however, is sometimes different among these samples.Two hundred sixty patients with CIED infection, who underwent lead extraction between April 2005 and December 2014, were analyzed. More than two blood culture sets, all the extracted leads, and swab culture of the pocket were sent to the laboratory for culture. Among the patients all of whose microbiological examinations were available, we analyzed the causative organism defined as the species detected in at least two different sites.All the culture results were available in the 208 patients, showing 69 systemic infections (including 30 cases of infectious endocarditis) and 139 local infections. Blood culture, lead culture, and swab culture were positive in 57 (27%), 169 (81%), and 152 (73%), respectively. Staphylococcus aureus [37% including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (12%)] and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS, 36%) were the most common causative organism, followed by non-staphylococci (23%), and poly-microbial infection (4%). The detection of S. aureus from pocket or removed leads rendered higher predictive value of a causative organism than that of CoNS. The detection of Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria indicated that it was most likely a causative organism. Gram-positive bacteria excluding Staphylococcus, such as Corynebacterium spp., tended to coexist as a benign organism.The causative organism is mostly S. aureus and CoNS. Detection of S. aureus or Gram-negative bacteria means that it is more likely a causative organism."

0,Risk factors for the development of intra-abdominal fungal infections in acute pancreatitis.,"Intra-abdominal fungal infections (AFIs) complicating acute pancreatitis arise in the context of pancreatic necrosis. Our goal was to determine which risk factors contribute to AFI in patients with acute pancreatitis.Records were reviewed from 479 nontransfer patients admitted to our medical center with acute pancreatitis from 1985 to 2009. Using multivariable regression models, we identified risk factors for AFI.Of 479 patients admitted with acute pancreatitis, 17 patients were subsequently found to have an AFI and 3 of these patients died. The mean length of stay for patients with an AFI was 24 days, and 76% were admitted to the intensive care unit. The patients with AFI were more likely to have received prophylactic antibiotics on admission (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.3) and total parenteral nutrition within 7 days of admission (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7) or to have necrosis on CT scan within 7 days of admission (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7). Multivariable regression models identified admission antibiotic use (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.8) as the strongest predictor of AFI.Admission antibiotics are the biggest risk factor for the development of intra-AFIs in acute pancreatitis. Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infected necrosis should therefore be discouraged."
0,How to treat severe infections in critically ill neutropenic patients?,"Severe infections in neutropenic patient often progress rapidly leading to life-threatening organ dysfunction requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit. Management strategies include early adequate appropriate empirical antimicrobial, early admission to ICU to avoid any delay in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of organ dysfunction. This review discusses the main clinical situations encountered in critically ill neutropenic patients. Specific diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have been proposed for acute respiratory failure, shock, neutropenic enterocolitis, catheter-related infections, cellulitis and primary bacteriemia. Non anti-infectious agents and recent advances will also be discussed. At present, most of large-scale studies and recommendations in neutropenic patients stem from hematological patients and will need further validation in ICU patients. "
0,The microbiology of secondary and postoperative pancreatic infections: implications for antimicrobial management.,"We reviewed our experience with secondary pancreatic infections with a focus on preemptive intervention and the potential alteration of the recovered microbial flora. The pathogens associated with postoperative pancreatic infections were analyzed with respect to nonenteric organisms, if any, that were recovered. We hypothesized that our findings might alter the antimicrobial management of these patients.Retrospective review.Hospitals affiliated with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis.Patients developing secondary and postoperative pancreatic infections following severe acute pancreatitis.Factors examined relative to secondary pancreatitis included preoperative antibiotic use and antecedent extrapancreatic infections potentially implicated in seeding the pancreatic bed. Patients who had elective resection received 24 to 48 hours of antibiotic prophylaxis.Twenty-two patients required surgery for secondary infections following severe acute pancreatitis, with 29 pathogenic isolates being recovered. Of these 22 patients, 14 received vancomycin hydrochloride prior to surgical intervention. Of those 14 patients, 6 had isolates recovered at the time of surgery that were positive for Enterococcus faecalis and 5 of these isolates were vancomycin resistant. Eight of the 22 patients received antifungal prophylaxis with no fungi recovered from intraoperative culture. However, 2 of the 14 patients who did not receive empiric therapy had isolates that were positive for fungi. Five patients who required an urgent operation for sepsis had pathogenic isolates that were similar to those recovered from central lines. Postoperative infections occurred in 40 of 225 patients (17.8%) who had an elective pancreatic resection, with 72 pathogenic isolates being recovered. Of these 40 patients, 22 (55.0%) had polymicrobial infections. Of the 72 pathogenic isolates recovered from patients, 34 (47.2%) were gram-positive organisms, 15 (20.8%) were fungal organisms, and 17 (23.6%) were drug-resistant bacteria.Prolonged vancomycin use in patients with severe acute pancreatitis is associated with the acquisition of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Empiric antifungal therapy may reduce the incidence of secondary fungal pancreatic infections. Systemic bloodstream infections at extrapancreatic sites can lead to seeding of pancreatic pseudocysts. Postoperative infections frequently include gram-positive, fungal, and drug-resistant organisms, and empiric therapy directed at these pathogens should be utilized until definitive culture results are obtained."
0,Predictors of Monomicrobial Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections.,"Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is critical in the management of necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) in the emergency setting. Clindamycin often is included empirically to cover monomicrobial gram-positive pathogens but probably is of little value for polymicrobial infections and is associated with significant side effects, including the induction of Clostridium difficile colitis. However, there have been no studies predicting monomicrobial infections prior to obtaining cultures. The purpose of this study was to identify independent predictors of monomicrobial NSTI where the use of clindamycin would be most beneficial. We hypothesized that monomicrobial infections are characterized by involvement of the upper extremities and fewer co-morbid diseases.We reviewed all cases of potential NSTI occurring between 1996 and 2013 in a single tertiary-care center. The infection was diagnosed by the finding of rapidly progressing necrotic fascia during debridement with positive cultures of tissue. Univariable analysis was performed using the Student t-, Wilcoxon rank sum, ??2, and Fisher exact tests as appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent variables associated with outcomes.A group of 151 patients with confirmed NSTI with complete data was used. Of the monomicrobial infections, 61.8% were caused by Group A streptococci, 20.1% by Staphylococcus aureus, and 12.7% by Escherichia coli. Of the polymicrobial infections, E. coli was involved 13.7% of the time, followed by Candida spp. at 12.9%, and Bacteroides fragilis at 11.3%. On univariable analysis, immunosuppression, upper extremity infection, and elevated serum sodium concentration were associated with monomicrobial infection, whereas morbid obesity and a perineal infection site were associated with polymicrobial infection. On multivariable analysis, the strongest predictor of monomicrobial infection was immunosuppression (odds ratio [OR] 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-22.3) followed by initial serum sodium concentration (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.2). Morbid obesity (OR 0.1; 95% CI 0.0-0.5) and perineal infection (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.8) were independently associated with polymicrobial infection.We identified independent risk factors that may be helpful in differentiating monomicrobial from polymicrobial NSTI. We suggest empiric clindamycin coverage be limited to patients who are immunosuppressed, have an elevated serum sodium concentration, or have upper extremity involvement and be avoided in obese patients or those with perineal disease."
0,"Prevention, detection, and management of early bacterial and fungal infections in a preclinical cardiac xenotransplantation model that achieves prolonged survival.","We analyzed bacterial and fungal infectious complications in a cohort of 16 consecutive experiments with the longest surviving cardiac xenografts to date.Transgenic, porcine-to-baboon, heterotopic (abdomen) cardiac xenotransplantation was performed in 16 consecutive experiments, using rapamycin, tacrolimus, corticosteroids, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and an alpha-Gal-PEG polymer, as immunosuppression. Prophylactic anti-microbials included i.v. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, oral ganciclovir/valganciclovir, and oral itraconazole. An episode of bacterial infection was defined as a positive blood and/or wound culture with: leukocytosis, fever >101.5 degrees F, and/or clinical deterioration.Mean graft survival was 71 +/- 29 days; the longest was 113 days. There were 23 episodes of bacterial infection; 14 resolved with treatment. The mean time to the first episode of infection was 44 +/- 21 days (n=12). Eight of 16 deaths were due to infection: two bacterial-only, two cytomegalovirus (CMV) only, four both bacterial and CMV, and none fungal. The frequency of infection was 1, 2.8, and 1.8 episodes/100 survival days, respectively, for animals whose grafts survived for 30 to 59, 60 to 89, and >90 days. CMV infection (reviewed in detail in a separate communications) was due to baboon CMV, and was associated with low serum levels of ganciclovir.In a cardiac xenograft model that achieved prolonged (>3 months) survival, bacteremia was common, but usually reversible, and fungal infection was prevented with prophylaxis. The level of immunosuppression required to achieve clinically meaningful xenograft survival is associated with a level of bacterial and fungal infectious complications that is manageable and similar to the early clinical experiences in human transplantation. Further research will determine if the viral infectious complications observed in these experiments can be reduced by optimizing blood levels of anti-viral prophylaxis and monitoring viral polymerase chain reaction levels."
0,The contribution of mast cells to bacterial and fungal infection immunity.,"Mast cells are hematopoietic progenitor-derived, granule-containing immune cells that are widely distributed in tissues that interact with the external environment, such as the skin and mucosal tissues. It is well-known that mast cells are significantly involved in IgE-mediated allergic reactions, but because of their location, it has also been long hypothesized that mast cells can act as sentinel cells that sense pathogens and initiate protective immune responses. Using mast cell or mast cell protease-deficient murine models, recent studies by our groups and others indicate that mast cells have pleiotropic regulatory roles in immunological responses against pathogens. In this review, we discuss studies that demonstrate that mast cells can either promote host resistance to infections caused by bacteria and fungi or contribute to dysregulated immune responses that can increase host morbidity and mortality. Overall, these studies indicate that mast cells can influence innate immune responses against bacterial and fungal infections via multiple mechanisms. Importantly, the contribution of mast cells to infection outcomes depends in part on the infection model, including the genetic approach used to assess the influence of mast cells on host immunity, hence highlighting the complexity of mast cell biology in the context of innate immune responses."
0,Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Glycoconjugates for Vaccine Development.,"During the last decade there has been a growing interest in glycoimmunology, a relatively new research field dealing with the specific interactions of carbohydrates with the immune system. Pathogens' cell surfaces are covered by a thick layer of oligo- and polysaccharides that are crucial virulence factors, as they mediate receptors binding on host cells for initial adhesion and organism invasion. Since in most cases these saccharide structures are uniquely exposed on the pathogen surface, they represent attractive targets for vaccine design. Polysaccharides isolated from cell walls of microorganisms and chemically conjugated to immunogenic proteins have been used as antigens for vaccine development for a range of infectious diseases. However, several challenges are associated with carbohydrate antigens purified from natural sources, such as their difficult characterization and heterogeneous composition. Consequently, glycoconjugates with chemically well-defined structures, that are able to confer highly reproducible biological properties and a better safety profile, are at the forefront of vaccine development. Following on from our previous review on the subject, in the present account we specifically focus on the most recent advances in the synthesis and preliminary immunological evaluation of next generation glycoconjugate vaccines designed to target bacterial and fungal infections that have been reported in the literature since 2011."
0,Survey of fungi and yeast in polymicrobial infections in chronic wounds.,"To assess the incidence, abundance and species diversity of fungi in chronic wounds, as well as to describe the associations of major fungi populations.Comprehensive molecular diagnostic reports were evaluated from a total of 915 chronic wounds in a retrospective study.Of the 915 clinical specimens, 208 (23%) were positive for fungal species. These samples were further compared in a compiled dataset, and sub-classified among the four major chronic wound types (decubitus ulcer, diabetic foot ulcer, non-healing surgical wound, and venous leg ulcer). The most abundant fungi were yeasts in the genus Candida; however, Curvularia, Malessezia, Aureobasidium, Cladosporium, Ulocladium, Engodontium and Trichtophyton were also found to be prevalent components of these polymicrobial infections. A notable bacterial/fungal negative correlation was found to be apparent between Staphylococcus and Candida. There were also significant relationships between both bacterial and fungal genera and patient metadata including gender, diabetes status and cardiovascular comorbidities.This microbial survey shows that fungi are more important wound pathogens and opportunistic pathogens than previously reported, exemplifying the impact of these under-reported pathogens. With the application of modern cost-effective and comprehensive molecular diagnostics, clinicians can now identify and address this significant component of chronic wound bioburden with targeted therapies, thereby improving healing trajectories."
0,"Update on clindamycin in the management of bacterial, fungal and protozoal infections.","Lincomycin and clindamycin are the only members of the relatively small lincosamide antimicrobial class marketed for use in humans. This paper only reviews data regarding clindamycin, with an emphasis on data published over the last decade. Clindamycin exhibits a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including Gram-positive aerobes/anaerobes, Gram-negative anaerobes and select protozoa (Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, Babesia spp.) and fungi (Pneumocystis jiroveci). It still enjoys use in the therapy and prophylaxis of a large number of bacterial, protozoal and fungal infections, despite > 40 years of clinical use. However, the spectre of resistance by an increasing number of microorganisms is beginning to cast a shadow over the future use of this valuable agent. With the emergence and spread of infections due to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococci (for which clindamycin is a first-line agent), it is hoped that the issues of resistance can be mitigated and the use of clindamycin extended for at least the foreseeable future."
0,Non-viral infections in children after renal transplantation.,"Renal transplantation has long been recognised as the gold standard treatment for children with end-stage renal failure. There has been an improvement over the years in patient and renal allograft survival because of improved immunosuppression, surgical techniques and living kidney donation. Despite reduced acute allograft rejection rates, non-viral infections continue to be a serious complication for paediatric renal transplant recipients (RTR). The risk of infections in RTR is determined by the pre-transplantation immunisation status, post-transplant exposure to potential pathogens and the amount of immunosuppression. The greatest risk of life-threatening and Cytomegalovirus infections is during the first 6 months post-transplant owing to a high immunosuppressive burden. The potential sources of bacterial infections are donor derived, transplant medium fluid, peritoneal and haemodialysis catheter and transplant ureteric stent. Urinary tract infections are frequent in patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction and can result in renal allograft damage. This review outlines the incidence, timing, risk factors, prevention and treatment of non-viral infections in paediatric RTR by critically reviewing current immunosuppressive regimens, their risk-benefit ratio in order to optimise renal allograft survival with reduced rates of rejection and infectious complications."
0,Spectrum of external catheter-related infections in children with acute leukemia-Single-center experience.,"External catheters (ECs) are commonly used in children who are receiving treatment for acute leukemia.To study the spectrum of microorganisms and to compare the rates of infection.A total of 42 ECs were inserted, including 28 Port-A-Caths, 11 CVC lines and 3 Hickman lines. Single ECs were required for 19 patients (45.2%), whereas 2, 3 and 4 ECs were required in 8, 1 and 1 patients, respectively.Overall, 37 culture-documented infections were present in 18 (62%) patients who had ECs. Gram-positive microorganisms were identified in 20 cases, Gram-negative microorganisms in 14 cases and fungal infections in 3 cases. Of the 42 devices implanted, 10 out of 28 Port-A-Caths (35.7%), 2 out of 3 Hickman catheters (66.7%) and 9 out of 11 central venous catheters (81.8%) required removal due to infection. The average length of working life for the ports was 330.6 days (range: 40-1043 days). The median rate of complications due to infection was 2.84 infections per 1000 catheter days (interquartile range: -1.55 to 5.8), and the number of infections was correlated with the number of ports (Pearson's r=0.51; p<0.05)."
0,Targeted treatment of invasive fungal infections accelerates healing of foot wounds in patients with Type 2 diabetes.,"To test the hypothesis that fluconazole plus standard care is superior to the standard care for diabetic foot wounds infected with deep-seated fungal infections.We carried out a randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-arm study in 75 patients with both fungal and bacterial infections in deep tissues of diabetic foot wounds. Thirty-seven patients (control group) were given standard care (surgical debridement + culture-specific antibiotics + offloading + glycaemic control) and 38 patients (treatment group) were given fluconazole 150 mg daily plus standard care. Wound surface area was measured every 2 weeks until the endpoints (complete epithelialization or skin grafting) were met.By week 4, the mean wound surface area reduced to 27.3 from 111.5 cm(2) in the treatment group, as opposed to 67.1 from 87.3 cm(2) in the control group. Subsequently, the mean wound surface areas were remarkably smaller in the treatment group compared with the control group, and statistically significant differences (P ??? 0.05) in mean wound surface area were observed between the treatment group and the control group at week 6. However, no statistically significant (P ??? 0.47) difference in complete healing was observed between the treatment group and the control group, 20 vs. 24. The mean wound healing time for the treatment group was 7.3 weeks, whereas for the control group it was 11.3 weeks (P ??? 0.022). Similarly, the probability of wound healing in the treatment group was 50 vs. 20% in the control group at week 10.Fluconazole plus standard care was superior to standard care alone in accelerating wound reduction among patients with diabetes with deep-seated fungal infections in diabetic foot wounds. Those in the treatment group who did heal, healed more quickly (P ??? 0.022), but overall healing was not different."
0,Nonbacterial Causes of Lymphangitis with Streaking.,"Lymphangitic streaking, characterized by linear erythema on the skin, is most commonly observed in the setting of bacterial infection. However, a number of nonbacterial causes can result in lymphangitic streaking. We sought to elucidate the nonbacterial causes of lymphangitic streaking that may mimic bacterial infection to broaden clinicians' differential diagnosis for patients presenting with lymphangitic streaking.We performed a review of the literature, including all available reports pertaining to nonbacterial causes of lymphangitic streaking.Various nonbacterial causes can result in lymphangitic streaking, including viral and fungal infections, insect or spider bites, and iatrogenic etiologies.Awareness of potential nonbacterial causes of superficial lymphangitis is important to avoid misdiagnosis and delay the administration of appropriate care."
0,Polymicrobial infections involving clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.,"Interactions between fungi and bacteria and their relevance to human health and disease have recently attracted increased attention in biomedical fields. Emerging evidence shows that bacteria and fungi can have synergistic or antagonistic interactions, each with important implications for human colonization and disease. It is now appreciated that some of these interactions may be strategic and helps promote the survival of one or both microorganisms within the host. This review will shed light on clinically relevant interactions between fungi and Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanism of interaction, host immune responses, and preventive measures will also be reviewed."
0,Toxic epidermal necrolysis data from the CELESTE multinational registry. Part I: Epidemiology and general microbiological characteristics.,"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare, life-threatening autoimmune disease predominantly manifested in the skin and mucous membranes. Today, infectious complications have the dominant share in mortality of TEN patients. Due to the nature of the therapy and administration of immunosuppressive medications, a wide range of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, which cause infectious complications in different compartments in these patients, is not surprising.This is a multicentric study, which included all patients with TEN hospitalized between 2000-2015 in specialized centres in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The total catchment area was over 12.5 million inhabitants. The actual implementation of the project was carried out using data obtained from the registry CELESTE (Central European LyEll Syndrome: Therapeutic Evaluation), when specific parameters relating to epidemiological indicators and infectious complications in patients with TEN were evaluated in the form of a retrospective analysis.In total, 39 patients with TEN were included in the study (12 patients died, mortality was 31%), who were hospitalized in the monitored period. The median age of patients in the group was 63 years (the range was 4-83 years, the mean was 51 years), the median of the exfoliated area was 70% TBSA (total body surface area) (range 30-100%, mean 67%). SCORTEN was calculated for 38 patients on the day of admission. Its median in all patients was 3 (range 1-6; mean 3). Any kind of infectious complication in the study group was recorded in 33 patients in total (85%). In total, 30 patients (77%) were infected with gram-positive cocci, 27 patients (69%) with gram-negative rods, and yeast cells or fibrous sponge were cultivated in 12 patients (31%). A total of 32 patients (82%) were found to have infectious complications in the exfoliated area, 15 patients (39%) had lower respiratory tract infections, 18 patients (46%) urinary tract infections and 15 patients (39%) an infection in the bloodstream. The most common potentially pathogenic microorganism isolated in our study group was coagulase neg. Staphylococcus, which caused infectious complications in 24 patients. Enterococcus faecalis/faecium (19 patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (11 patients) and Escherichia coli (11 patients) were other most frequently isolated micro-organisms.The published data were obtained from the unique registry of TEN patients in Central Europe. In the first part, we have succeeded in defining the basic epidemiological indicators in the group of patients anonymously included in this registry. The study clearly confirms that infectious complications currently play an essential role in TEN patients, often limiting the chances of survival. The study also shows a high prevalence of these complications in the period after 15days from the start of hospitalization, when most patients already have completely regenerated skin cover."
0,Tuberculous and Infectious Pericarditis.,"Viral pericarditis is the most common cause of acute pericarditis and it is typically responsive to aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tuberculous pericarditis is common in immunocompromised patients or in immunocompetent patients in endemic areas. The diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis usually requires a multidisciplinary approach, and presumptive treatment should be started for people with suspected infections living in endemic areas. Antituberculous treatment along with corticosteroid therapy can reduce complications from constrictive pericarditis. Purulent pericarditis is fatal if untreated. Bacterial and fungal cultures from pericardial fluid and blood are essential to determine the best treatment."
0,Which tree orders in southern Africa have the highest antimicrobial activity and selectivity against bacterial and fungal pathogens of animals?,"The study randomly screened leaf extracts of several hundred southern African tree species against important microbial pathogens to determine which taxa have the highest activity and may yield useful products to treat infections in the animal health market.We determined the antibacterial and antifungal activity of 714 acetone leaf extracts of 537 different tree species against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. A sensitive serial dilution microplate method was used.Several extracts had MICs as low as 0.02 mg/ml. We analysed 14 out of the 38 tree orders where we determined the activity of more than 8 different tree species representing 89% of all species examined. There were statistically significant differences in some cases. Celastrales, Rosales and Myrtales had the highest activity against Gram-positive bacteria, the Myrtales and Fabales against the Gram-negative bacteria and the Malvales and Proteales against the fungi. Species present in the Asterales followed by the Gentiales and Lamiales had the lowest activities against all the microorganisms tested. Fabales species had the highest activities against all the microorganisms tested. There was substantial selectivity in some orders. Proteales species had very high activity against the fungi but very low activity against the bacteria. The species in the Celastrales and Rosales had very low antifungal activity, low activity against Gram-negative bacteria and very high activity against Gram-positive bacteria.Against all classes of microorganisms, the four orders containing species with the highest average antimicrobial activities also contained several species with low activities against different pathogens and vice versa. These results therefore should be used with circumspection in selecting tree orders that would yield the highest probability of finding species with promising activities. Nevertheless there was a twofold increase in probability of finding extracts with interesting antifungal activity from orders with high mean activity than from orders with low mean activity. The probability increased to threefold and fivefold for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria respectively."
0,Functional Interaction between Apolipophorins and Complement Regulate the Mosquito Immune Response to Systemic Infections.,"The complement-like protein thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) is the hallmark effector molecule against Plasmodium ookinetes in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. We have previously shown that the knockdown of the noncatalytic clip domain serine protease CLIPA2 increased TEP1-mediated killing rendering mosquitoes more resistant to Plasmodium, bacterial and fungal infections. Here, CLIPA2 coimmunoprecipitation from the hemolymph of Beauveria bassiana-infected mosquitoes followed by mass spectrometry and functional genetic analysis led to the identification of the Apolipophorin-II/I gene, encoding the two lipid carrier proteins Apo-I and II, as a novel negative regulator of TEP1-mediated immune response during mosquito systemic infections. Apo-II/I exhibits a similar RNAi phenotype as CLIPA2 in mosquito bioassays characterized by increased resistance to B. bassiana and Escherichia coli infections. We provide evidence that this enhanced resistance to systemic infections is TEP1 dependent. Interestingly, silencing Apo-II/I but not CLIPA2 upregulated the expression of TEP1 following systemic infections with E. coli and B. bassiana in a c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway-dependent manner. Our results suggest that mosquito Apo-II/I plays an important immune regulatory role during systemic infections and provide novel insight into the functional interplay between lipid metabolism and immune gene regulation."
0,Infections of the Central Nervous System after Unrelated Donor Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation or Human Leukocyte Antigen-Matched Sibling Transplantation.,"We analyzed the incidence, clinical characteristics, prognostic factors, and outcome of central nervous system (CNS) infections in consecutive patients with receiving umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) (n?€?=?€?343) or HLA-matched sibling donor stem cell transplantation (MST) (n?€?=?€?366). Thirty-four CNS infections were documented at a median time of 116 days after transplantation (range, 7 to 1161). The cumulative incidence (CI) risk of developing a CNS infection was .6% at day +30, 2.3% at day +90, and 4.9% at 5 years. The 5-year CI of CNS infection was 8.2% after UCBT and 1.7% after MST (P?€?<?€?.001). The causative micro-organisms of CNS infections were fungi (35%), virus (32%), Toxoplasma spp. (12%), and bacteria (12%). Fungal infections occurred in 11 patients after UCBT and 1 after MST and were due to Aspergillus spp. (n = 8), Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 2), Scedosporium prolificans (n = 1), and Mucor (n = 1). Except for 1 patient, all died from CNS fungal infection. Viral infections occurred in 9 patients after UCBT and 1 after MST and were due to human herpes virus 6 (n = 7), cytomegalovirus (n = 2), and varicella zoster virus (n = 1). CNS toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in 3 patients after UCBT and 1 after MST. Other pathogens were Staphylococcus spp, Nocardia spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Twenty of the 34 patients (59%) died from the CNS infection. In multivariable analysis, UCBT and disease stage beyond first complete remission were independently associated with the risk of developing CNS infections. The 5-year overall survival was 19% in patients who developed a CNS and 39% for those who did not (P?€?=?€?.006). In conclusion, our study showed that CNS infections are a significant clinical problem after stem cell transplantation associated with poor survival. They were more frequent after UCBT compared to MST."
0,Fungal infections in severe acute pancreatitis.,"Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The majority of deaths related to SAP are the result of infectious complications. Although bacterial infections are most commonly encountered, fungal infections are increasingly being recognized. Candida is the most common fungal infection. The occurrence of fungal infection in patients with acute pancreatitis adversely affects the clinical course, leading to a higher incidence of systemic complications, and possibly mortality as well. Important risk factors for fungal infection in patients with acute pancreatitis include broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization and surgical/endoscopic interventions, use of total parenteral nutrition, and mechanical ventilation. Patients with higher severity of pancreatitis are at a greater risk. The pathogenesis of fungal infection in patients with acute pancreatitis is multifactorial. Translocation of microorganisms across the gut epithelium, lymphocyte dysfunction, and the virulence of the invading microorganisms play important roles. Histological demonstration of fungi remains the gold standard of diagnosis, but a positive biopsy is rarely obtained. The role of biomarkers in the diagnosis is being investigated. As early diagnosis and treatment can lead to improved outcome, a high index of suspicion is required for prompt diagnosis. Limiting the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, early introduction of enteral nutrition, and timely change of vascular catheters are important preventive strategies. The role of antifungal prophylaxis remains controversial. Surgical necrosectomy with antifungal therapy is the most widely used treatment approach. Clinical trials on antifungal prophylaxis are needed, and indications for surgical intervention need to be clearly defined."
0,Patterns of infectious complications in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes patients treated with 10-day decitabine regimen.,"Decitabine has been explored as a reduced-intensity therapy for older or unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To better understand the risk of infections during decitabine treatment, we retrospectively examined the culture results from each infection-related serious adverse event that occurred among 85 AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients treated in a prospective clinical study using 10-day cycles of decitabine at Washington University School of Medicine. Culture results were available for 163 infection-related complications that occurred in 70 patients: 90 (55.2%) events were culture-negative, 32 (19.6%) were gram-positive bacteria, 20 (12.3%) were gram-negative bacteria, 12 (7.4%) were mixed, 6 (3.7%) were viral, 2 (1.2%) were fungal, and 1 (0.6%) was mycobacterial. Infection-related mortality occurred in 3/24 (13%) of gram-negative events, and 0/51 gram-positive events. On average, nearly one third of patients experienced an infection-related complication with each cycle, and the incidence did not decrease during later cycles. In summary, in patients receiving 10-day decitabine, infectious complications are common and may occur during any cycle of therapy. Although febrile events are commonly culture-negative, gram-positive infections are the most frequent source of culture-positive infections, but gram-negative infections represent a significant risk of mortality in AML and MDS patients treated with decitabine."
0,Fungal infections after liver transplantation: incidence and outcome.,"Fungal infections, although less frequent than bacterial infections, represent a severe comorbidity with an exponential increase in mortality rate in liver transplantation patients. The incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) after solid organ transplantation ranges from 7% to 42%, with Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. as the most common pathogens. Fungal infections in liver transplant recipients have been associated with poor outcome and mortality rates ranging from 65% to 90% for invasive aspergillosis and 30% to 50% for invasive candidiasis. The results largely depend on early diagnosis and early initiation of specific treatment for IFIs. Therefore, the diagnosis must be prompt, preferably based on microbiological data, both cultures and biomarkers, and/or based on clinical features and known risk factors.This study evaluated the incidence of fungal infections in patients after liver transplantation in our center between January 2003 and December 2012. The retrospective analysis of 215 consecutive liver transplantation patients was undertaken to estimate incidence, risk factors, and clinical courses of IFIs in the first 3 months after liver transplantation.Candidemia and invasive candidiasis microbiologically proven were found in 26 patients (12%), whereas in 6 patients (2.8%) invasive fungal infections from other non-Candida fungi developed: Aspergillus (4 cases: 2 A fumigatus, 2 A terreus), Fusarium oxysporum (1 case), and Rhodotorula rubra (1 case). Two patients with Aspergillus and the patient with Fusarium died. The patient with Rhodotorula as well as 22 of the patients with candidemia (85%) survived. All of the episodes developed during the first 3 months posttransplantation. All cases have followed a previous polymicrobial bacterial infection (especially in the biliary tract) with large use of combined antibiotic therapies.The rate of fungal infection was found to increase in parallel with the number of risk factors. Prophylactic strategies can decrease the risk of fungal infections. Early detection and treatment with adequate early empiric therapy is the key to obtaining a better outcome in liver transplantation patients."
0,Cumulative arsenic exposure is associated with fungal infections: Two cohort studies based on southwestern and northeastern basins in Taiwan.,"Long-term arsenic exposure results in atherosclerosis and cancers, along with aberrant immune responses. Animal-based and epidemiological studies indicate that arsenic exposure increases susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections. This study aimed to assess whether arsenic exposure is associated with the development of fungal infection, which is substantially attributed to as a cause of aberrant immunity. Based on two well-established cohorts from two basins in southwestern (SW; high arsenic area) and northeastern (NE; low arsenic area) Taiwan (n=297 and 2738, respectively), the arsenic exposure in well water was estimated using HPLC-ICP-MS. Fungal infections were defined via clinical and mycological assessments (PCR of fungal 18S rRNA) of nail samples. Individuals in SW cohort with cumulative arsenic exposure >10,000??g/L???years had a higher risk of developing fungal infections (OR=1.57, 95% CI=1.08-1.92) after adjusting for diabetes and occupation. In NE cohort, female sex, alcohol consumption, and chronic kidney diseases were associated with toenail infections. In contrast, fingernail infections (OR=1.33, 95% CI=1.05-1.68) were highly associated with arsenic exposure in a dose-dependent manner. We are the first to report palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis upon low arsenic exposure in 3.9% and 6.7% individuals, respectively. This is the first large-scale study showing arsenic exposure is associated with fungal infections in a dose-dependent manner."
0,"Characteristics, Clinical Relevance, and the Role of Echinocandins in Fungal-Bacterial Interactions.","Fungal-bacterial interactions are common in the environment. The interactions between invasive fungi (eg, Candida species and Aspergillus species) and pathogenic bacteria can be particularly significant in the outcome of human infections. Study of these interactions in vivo using murine or invertebrate models, such as Caenorhabditis elegans or Galleria mellonella, has been very helpful in increasing our understanding of the pathogenesis of mixed infections and in identifying ways to use this between-kingdom interplay to our advantage. Based on their effect against fungal biofilms and their immunomodulatory properties, the newer class of antifungal agents, known as echinocandins, has the potential to be useful in polymicrobial infections and in high-risk complex infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or sepsis where colonization by fungi can lead to worse outcomes.

0,Spine infections.,"Infections of the spine represent a rare but potentially debilitating and neurologically devastating condition for patients. Early diagnosis, imaging, and intervention may prevent some of the more critical complications that may ensue from this disease process, including alignment abnormalities, central canal compromise, nerve root impingement, vascular complications, and spinal cord injury. This article reviews the underlying pathophysiologic basis of infection, clinical manifestations, and imaging modalities used to diagnose infections of the spine and spinal cord."
0,The role of water in healthcare-associated infections.,"The aim is to discuss the epidemiology of infections that arise from contaminated water in healthcare settings, including Legionnaires' disease, other Gram-negative pathogens, nontuberculous mycobacteria, and fungi.Legionella can colonize a hospital water system and infect patients despite use of preventive disinfectants. Evidence-based measures are available for secondary prevention. Vulnerable patients can develop healthcare-associated infections with waterborne organisms that are transmitted by colonization of plumbing systems, including sinks and their fixtures. Room humidifiers and decorative fountains have been implicated in serious outbreaks, and pose unwarranted risks in healthcare settings.Design of hospital plumbing must be purposeful and thoughtful to avoid the features that foster growth and dissemination of Legionella and other pathogens. Exposure of patients who have central venous catheters and other invasive devices to tap water poses a risk for infection with waterborne pathogens. Healthcare facilities must conduct aggressive clinical surveillance for Legionnaires' disease and other waterborne infections in order to detect and remediate an outbreak promptly. Hand hygiene is the most important measure to prevent transmission of other Gram-negative waterborne pathogens in the healthcare setting."
0,HIV acquisition during pregnancy and postpartum is associated with genital infections and partnership characteristics.,"The objective of this study is to determine the risk and cofactors for HIV acquisition during pregnancy and postpartum.A prospective cohort study: Pregnant women in western Kenya were enrolled if HIV seronegative at that visit or within 3 months. Serial HIV nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) were conducted at 1 to 3-month intervals to 9 months postpartum. Genital swabs were collected for detection of chlamydia and gonorrhoea at baseline, and for trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis and yeast at baseline and follow-up.Among 1304 pregnant women, median age was 22 years, 78% were married for a median of 4 years, 66% reported knowing partner HIV status and 8% reported using condoms. Study retention was 98%. During 1235 person-years of follow-up, HIV incidence was 2.31/100 person-years [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.71-4.10]. Incident HIV was associated with syphilis (hazard ratio 9.18, 95% CI 2.15-39.3), chlamydia (hazard ratio 4.49, 95% CI 1.34-15.0), bacterial vaginosis (hazard ratio 2.91, 95% CI 1.25-6.76), yeast (hazard ratio 3.46, 95% CI 1.46-8.19), sexually transmitted infection (STI) history (hazard ratio 3.48, 95% CI 1.31-9.27), lifetime number of sex partners (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.37), partner age discordance (hazard ratio 1.07 per year, 95% CI 1.02-1.13) and shorter marriage (hazard ratio 1.19 per year, 95% CI 1.03-1.38). No women with incident HIV reported an HIV-infected partner. In multivariate analyses, chlamydia, older partners and yeast infection remained significant; however, power was limited.Pregnant and lactating women may not perceive HIV risk and rarely used condoms. Prevention and treatment of genital infections and risk stratification to identify women for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could decrease HIV acquisition in pregnant/lactating women."
0,Urinary tract infections in the early posttransplant period after kidney transplantation: etiologic agents and their susceptibility.,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common infections in solid organ transplantation, especially in kidney transplantation.This study included 295 adult patients undergoing KTx between September 2001 and December 2007. All patients were followed prospectively for UTI during the first 4 weeks after surgery. Samples of urine were investigated by bacteriological cultures to identify microorganisms in accord with standard procedures. Susceptibility testing was performed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute procedures.Urine specimens (n=582) were obtained from 84.5% of 245 recipients during the first month after transplantation. Among the isolated bacterial strains (n=291), the most common were Gram-negative bacteria (56.4%) predominantly Serratia marcescens (32.3%) and Enterobacter cloacae (14.6%). Extended- spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL+) strains were isolated in 52.5% of cases. Gram-positive bacteria comprised 35.7%; most commonly, high-level aminoglycoside resistant (HLAR; 87.8%) and vancomycin-resistant (VRE; 11%) Enterococci. There were fungal strains in 23 cases (7.9%).Our study showed predominantly Gram-negative rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family comprising (84.8%) of Gram-negative isolates: 52.5% ESBL and resistant enterococci (87.5%) in Gram-positive isolates. The increased proportion of isolates of multi-drug-resistant bacterial agents which can cause severe UTIs may be due to our frequent use of ceftriaxone for perioperative bacterial prophylaxis."
0,Rapid real-time nucleic Acid sequence-based amplification-molecular beacon platform to detect fungal and bacterial bloodstream infections.,"Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Successful patient outcomes are diminished by a failure to rapidly diagnose these infections and initiate appropriate therapy. A rapid and reliable diagnostic platform of high sensitivity is needed for the management of patients with BSIs. The combination of an RNA-dependent nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and molecular beacon (NASBA-MB) detection system in multiplex format was developed to rapidly detect medically important BSI organisms. Probes and primers representing pan-gram-negative, pan-gram-positive, pan-fungal, pan-Candida, and pan-Aspergillus organisms were established utilizing 16S and 28S rRNA targets for bacteria and fungi, respectively. Two multiplex panels were developed to rapidly discriminate bacterial or fungal infections at the subkingdom/genus level with a sensitivity of 1 to 50 genomes. A clinical study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of this platform by evaluating 570 clinical samples from a tertiary-care hospital group using blood bottle samples. The sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index values for pan-gram-positive detection and pan-gram-negative detection were 99.7%, 100%, 0.997 and 98.6%, 95.9%, 0.945, respectively. The positive predictive values (PPV) and the negative predictive values (NPV) for these two probes were 100, 90.7, and 99.4, 99.4, respectively. Pan-fungal and pan-Candida probes showed 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV, and the pan-Aspergillus probe showed 100% NPV. Robust signals were observed for all probes in the multiplex panels, with signal detection in <15 min. The multiplex real-time NASBA-MB assay provides a valuable platform for the rapid and specific diagnosis of bloodstream pathogens, and reliable pathogen identification and characterization can be obtained in under 3 h."
0,Infections in the tissue material and their impact on the loss of transplants in the Laboratory of in vitro Cell and Tissue Culture with Tissue Bank in the years 2011-2015.,"Radiation sterilization eliminates microbiological infections but causes the degradation of the cell factor. The negative result of microbiological examination for tissue transplants is one of the conditions for approval for distribution in patients. The study attempts to verify impact of the presence of microbes onto material for transplant loss. In the 2011-2015 period, we analyzed 293 donors of skin and amnion. Microbiological sampling was performed. The total of 21 strains of bacteria, molds and fungi was identified in collected tissue. The widest spectrum of strains was found in skin (17), followed by amnia (8). The total number of positive findings was 147 and was again highest in skin (129), while the number of positive findings in amnia was 18 only. The general percentage of fungal infections was very low. The presence of fungal strains was only observed in allogeneic skin (2%). Large number of microorganisms isolated from the skin before sterilization was observed, so it seems impossible to use allogeneic intravital skin. However, the intravital application of allogeneic amnion obtained from cesarean section remains to be considered."
0,"A Treatment Protocol for Management of Bacterial and Fungal Malignant External Otitis: A Large Cohort in Tehran, Iran.","High rates of negative microbiologic test results highlight the potential role of empiric antimicrobial agents in management of malignant otitis externa (MOE). This study investigates the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and response to empiric treatment in a large group of patients admitted to a tertiary academic hospital in Tehran, Iran.We recruited 224 patients diagnosed with MOE in a prospective observation from 2009 through 2015. All patients received a 2-agent antibacterial regimen at baseline (phase I). Patients with no improvement within 10 days and/or nonresponders to a second course of antibacterials were switched to antifungals (phase II). Response to treatment was observed and documented in both groups.All patients had physical symptoms for more than 12 weeks before admission. In total, 127 patients responded well to antibacterials. Eighty-seven out of 97 patients who were switched to antifungals had complete response to treatment; patients in the latter group had significantly higher A1C levels at baseline.Our findings provide evidence to develop clinical guidelines that accelerate diagnosis and treatment of MOE to improve patient outcomes."
0,Long-term immune reconstitution and infection burden after mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) or umbilical cord blood (UCB) can be chosen as alternative donors for allogeneic stem cell transplantation but might be associated with long-lasting immune deficiency. Sixty-six patients who underwent a first transplantation from either UCB (n = 30) or 9/10 MMUD (n = 36) and who survived beyond 3 months were evaluated. Immune reconstitution was prospectively assessed at sequential time points after transplantation. NK, B, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells and their na??ve and memory subsets, as well as regulatory T cells (Treg), were studied. Detailed analyses on infections occurring after 3 months were also assessed. The 18-month cumulative incidences of infection-related death were 8% and 3%, and of infections were 72% and 57% after MMUD and UCB transplantation, respectively. Rates of infection per 12 patient-month were roughly 2 overall (1 for bacterial, .9 for viral, and .3 for fungal infections). Memory, na??ve CD4(+) and CD8(+)T cells, na??ve B cells, and Treg cells reconstitution between the 2 sources were roughly similar. Absolute CD4(+)T cells hardly reached 500 per ??L by 1 year after transplantation and most B cells were of na??ve phenotype. Correlations between immune reconstitution and infection were then performed by multivariate analyses. Low CD4(+) and high CD8(+)T cells absolute counts at 3 months were linked to increased risks of overall and viral (but not bacterial) infections. When assessing for the na??ve/memory phenotypes at 3 months among the CD4(+) T cell compartment, higher percentages of memory subsets were protective against late infections. Central memory CD4(+)T cells protected against overall and bacterial infections; late effector memory CD4(+)T cells protected against overall, bacterial, and viral infections. To the contrary, high percentage of effector- and late effector-memory subsets at 3 months among the CD8(+) T cell compartment predicted higher risks for viral infections. Patients who underwent transplantation from alternative donors represent a population with very high risk of infection. Detailed phenotypic analysis of immune reconstitution may help to evaluate infection risk and to adjust infection prophylaxis."
0,2-stage revision recommended for treatment of fungal hip and knee prosthetic joint infections.,"Fungal prosthetic joint infections are rare and difficult to treat. This systematic review was conducted to determine outcome and to give treatment recommendations.After an extensive search of the literature, 164 patients treated for fungal hip or knee prosthetic joint infection (PJI) were reviewed. This included 8 patients from our own institutions.Most patients presented with pain (78%) and swelling (65%). In 68% of the patients, 1 or more risk factors for fungal PJI were found. In 51% of the patients, radiographs showed signs of loosening of the arthroplasty. Candida species were cultured from most patients (88%). In 21% of all patients, fungal culture results were first considered to be contamination. There was co-infection with bacteria in 33% of the patients. For outcome analysis, 119 patients had an adequate follow-up of at least 2 years. Staged revision was the treatment performed most often, with the highest success rate (85%).Fungal PJI resembles chronic bacterial PJI. For diagnosis, multiple samples and prolonged culturing are essential. Fungal species should be considered to be pathogens. Co-infection with bacteria should be treated with additional antibacterial agents. We found no evidence that 1-stage revision, debridement, antibiotics, irrigation, and retention (DAIR) or antifungal therapy without surgical treatment adequately controls fungal PJI. Thus, staged revision should be the standard treatment for fungal PJI. After resection of the prosthesis, we recommend systemic antifungal treatment for at least 6 weeks-and until there are no clinical signs of infection and blood infection markers have normalized. Then reimplantation can be performed."
0,Genotyping bacterial and fungal pathogens using sequence variation in the gene for the CCA-adding enzyme.,"To allow an immediate treatment of an infection with suitable antibiotics and bactericides or fungicides, there is an urgent need for fast and precise identification of the causative human pathogens. Methods based on DNA sequence comparison like 16S rRNA analysis have become standard tools for pathogen verification. However, the distinction of closely related organisms remains a challenging task. To overcome such limitations, we identified a new genomic target sequence located in the single copy gene for tRNA nucleotidyltransferase fulfilling the requirements for a ubiquitous, yet highly specific DNA marker. In the present study, we demonstrate that this sequence marker has a higher discriminating potential than commonly used genotyping markers in pro- as well as eukaryotes, underscoring its applicability as an excellent diagnostic tool in infectology.Based on phylogenetic analyses, a region within the gene for tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (CCA-adding enzyme) was identified as highly heterogeneous. As prominent examples for pro- and eukaryotic pathogens, several Vibrio and Aspergillus species were used for genotyping and identification in a multiplex PCR approach followed by gel electrophoresis and fluorescence-based product detection. Compared to rRNA analysis, the selected gene region of the tRNA nucleotidyltransferase revealed a seven to 30-fold higher distinction potential between closely related Vibrio or Aspergillus species, respectively. The obtained data exhibit a superb genome specificity in the diagnostic analysis. Even in the presence of a 1,000-fold excess of human genomic DNA, no unspecific amplicons were produced.These results indicate that a relatively short segment of the coding region for tRNA nucleotidyltransferase has a higher discriminatory potential than most established diagnostic DNA markers. Besides identifying microbial pathogens in infections, further possible applications of this new marker are food hygiene controls or metagenome analyses."
0,Non-bacterial infections in Asian patients treated with alemtuzumab: a retrospective study of the Asian Lymphoma Study Group.,"This retrospective study concerns non-bacterial infections in Asian patients receiving alemtuzumab. The clinical data of 182 patients treated with alemtuzumab alone or alemtuzumab-containing chemotherapy between the years 2003 and 2009 was collected from six Asian countries. Alemtuzumab was used in the setting of frontline (n =48) or salvage (n =90) treatment, and as a part of the conditioning regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplant (n =44). Reactivation of cytomegalovirus (66/182) and varicella zoster virus (25/182), and fungal infection (31/182) including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, were the most common infectious complications in this retrospective analysis. Thus, we recommend routine prophylaxis with valganciclovir and itraconazole, especially when alemtuzumab is used in the conditioning regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplant. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) was found in four patients (3%, 4/122) receiving alemtuzumab as conditioning for stem cell transplant or salvage treatment. Three cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation were found in antigen-negative patients, and 16 cases of tuberculosis were observed. Infection is the major complication of alemtuzumab therapy, and these infectious complications are potentially severe and life-threatening. Based on our retrospective analysis, we have constructed a guideline for antimicrobial prophylaxis in Asian patients receiving alemtuzumab therapy."
0,Learning from other diseases: protection and pathology in chronic fungal infections.,"Fungal commensals coexist in a complex milieu of bacteria within the human body. An increased understanding of the importance of microbiota in shaping the host's immune and metabolic activities has rendered fungal interactions with their hosts more complex than previously appreciated. Metagenomics has revealed the complex interactions between fungal and bacterial commensals that, either directly or through the participation of the host immune system, impact on immune homeostasis at mucosal surfaces that, in turn, lead to secondary fungal infections. Metabolomics has captured the dialogue between the mammalian host and its microbiota. It appears that the host tryptophan catabolic enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) plays a dominant role in the interplay between tryptophan catabolism by microbial communities, the host's own pathway of metabolite production, and the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/IL-22 axis, eventually impacting on mucosal immune homeostasis and host/fungal symbiosis. Thus, the regulatory loop involving AhR and IDO1 may be exploited for the development of multi-pronged host- and microbiota-directed therapeutic approaches for mucosal and systemic fungal diseases. "
0,"Infections in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor antagonists: incidence, etiology and mortality in the BIOBADASER registry.","Whether the use of tumor necrosis factor antagonists increases the risk of infection remains a subject of open debate. Developing effective strategies of prevention and empirical treatment entails carefully establishing the etiology and prognosis of the infections.Analysis of the Spanish registry BIOBADASER (Feb-2000 to Jan-2006), a national drug safety registry of patients with rheumatic diseases.907 episodes of infection occurring in 6,969 patients were analyzed. The infection incidence observed was 53.09 cases/1,000 patients-years (CI 95% 49.69-56.66). The most frequent infections were skin infection (12.18 cases/1,000 patients-yrs), pneumonia (5.97 cases/1,000 patients-yrs), cystitis (3.92 cases/1,000 patients-yrs), tuberculosis (3.51 cases/1,000 patients-yrs) and arthritis (3.76 cases/1,000 patients-yrs). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella spp. emerged as important pathogens. Varicella zoster virus and Herpes simplex virus caused most cases of viral infections. Mucocutaneous candidiasis accounted for most fungal infections. Mortality was increased in infected patients (log-rank test p<0.0001). Pneumonia, sepsis, tuberculosis, abdominal infection and endocarditis were associated with significant attributable mortality.A significant number of bacterial, viral and fungal infections occurred in patients with rheumatic diseases treated with TNF antagonists. The information of this study can illuminate clinicians globally on how to address infection in this vulnerable group of patients."
0,DCD liver transplant infection: experience from a single centre in China.,"The purpose of our study was to evaluate the incidence, timing, location and risk factors for bacterial and fungal infections after donation after cardiac death (DCD) liver transplant and clearly delineate any relationship between infection and survival in DCD liver transplant recipients.We retrospectively reviewed 257 consecutive patients undergoing DCD liver transplant between October 2010 and May 2015 at our centre.A total of 133 patients (51.8%) developed at least one bacterial or fungal infection episode. The predominant infection site was the respiratory tract, followed by the blood stream. Most of the infections occurred within the first week after liver transplant (61.9%). A recipient respiratory support time greater than 7??days (p??=??0.041), post-transplant hospital time greater than 24??days (p??=??0.002) and renal failure after DCD liver transplant (p??=??0.039) were independent predictors of bacterial and fungal infection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of the transplant infection risk assessment model was 0.788. The 1- and 3-year survival rates for recipients without infection were significantly increased compared with recipients with infection (96.1% and 89.0% vs. 81.5% and 75.9%, p??=??0.007).This is the first study that offers detailed data revealing the timing and incidence of bacterial and fungal infection among adult DCD liver transplant recipients. Bacterial and fungal infection occurs at a high rate during the first week after DCD liver transplant, especially in patients with prolonged respiratory support time and renal failure, and infection is related to increased hospital stay."
0,Impact of Mucorales and Other Invasive Molds on Clinical Outcomes of Polymicrobial Traumatic Wound Infections.,"Combat trauma wounds with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are often polymicrobial with fungal and bacterial growth, but the impact of the wound microbiology on clinical outcomes is uncertain. Our objectives were to compare the microbiological features between IFI and non-IFI wounds and evaluate whether clinical outcomes differed among IFI wounds based upon mold type. Data from U.S. military personnel injured in Afghanistan with IFI wounds were examined. Controls were matched by the pattern/severity of injury, including blood transfusion requirements. Wound closure timing was compared between IFI and non-IFI control wounds (with/without bacterial infections). IFI wound closure was also assessed according to mold species isolation. Eighty-two IFI wounds and 136 non-IFI wounds (63 with skin and soft tissue infections [SSTIs] and 73 without) were examined. The time to wound closure was longer for the IFI wounds (median, 16 days) than for the non-IFI controls with/without SSTIs (medians, 12 and 9 days, respectively; P < 0.001). The growth of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods was reported among 35% and 41% of the IFI and non-IFI wounds with SSTIs, respectively. Among the IFI wounds, times to wound closure were significantly longer for wounds with Mucorales growth than for wounds with non-Mucorales growth (median, 17 days versus 13 days; P < 0.01). When wounds with Mucorales and Aspergillus spp. growth were compared, there was no significant difference in wound closure timing. Trauma wounds with SSTIs were often polymicrobial, yet the presence of invasive molds (predominant types: order Mucorales, Aspergillus spp., and Fusarium spp.) significantly prolonged the time to wound closure. Overall, the times to wound closure were longest for the IFI wounds with Mucorales growth. "
0,"Invasive fungal infections and (1,3)-beta-D-glucan serum concentrations in long-term intensive care patients.","Invasive fungal infections are associated with high morbidity and increased mortality. This study was performed to assess the epidemiology of fungal infections and to determine (1,3)-beta-D-glucan serum concentrations in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs).Overall 197 patients were admitted to nine medical and surgical intensive care units (ICUs) at a 2200-bed university hospital during a 3-month period. Retrospectively, the patients were split into three groups: group A comprised 24 patients with proven invasive fungal infections admitted for a median of 40 days. Group B comprised 58 patients who were admitted to the ICU for 30 days but without fungal infection. One hundred and fifteen post-operative patients served as controls (group C). The levels of (1,3)-beta-D-glucan were monitored in all patients twice weekly during their ICU admittance.Average (1,3)-beta-D-glucan concentrations were significantly higher in the patients with fungal infections compared to group B and group C (median 44 vs. 22 and 12.9 pg/ml, respectively; p<0.001). For a serum (1,3)-beta-D-glucan level of 40 pg/ml, the sensitivity, the specificity, the positive predictive value, the negative predictive value, the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics (AUC ROC) curve, the likelihood ratio (LR)+ and LR- were 52.2, 75.9, 46.2, 80, 0.7, 2.16, and 0.63, respectively, on day 7. Patients in group A had bacterial infections significantly more often than patients in group B (p=0.003). The hospitalization before ICU admittance for group A was significantly longer than for groups B and C (median 19 (group A) vs. 6 (group B) vs. 10 (group C) days; p<0.05).Longer hospitalization and multiple bacterial infections were found to be the main risk factors for invasive fungal infections. Long-term ICU patients have elevated (1,3)-beta-D-glucan levels, not only due to invasive fungal infections, but also due to the serious underlying diseases and conditions, inter-current complications, and intensive care measures. Yet, persistently high serum levels of (1,3)-beta-D-glucan in ICU patients may be indicative of invasive fungal infections and warrant additional diagnostic efforts."
0,Early-onset infections of very-low-birth-weight infants in Polish neonatal intensive care units.,"The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence, causes, the risk factors, etiologic agents and the outcomes of early-onset infections (EOIs) in very-low-birth-weight newborns in Polish neonatal intensive care units.Continuous prospective infection surveillance conducted during 2009 at 6 Polish neonatal intensive care units and included 910 newborns whose birth weight was lower than 1500 g. Infections were defined according to the Gastmeier's criteria. EOIs were diagnosed <3 days after delivery.The frequency of early-onset septicemia (EOS) was 7.0% and of early-onset pneumonia (EO-pneumonia) 8.6%. The factors significantly increasing the risk of EOS were low gestational age, small birth weight, low score in the Clinical Risk Index for Babies and Apgar score as well as maternal chorioamnionitis. The perinatal prophylaxis did not have an influence on the occurrence of EOS. The factors considerably increasing the risk of EO-pneumonia were low scores in the Clinical Risk Index for Babies and Apgar scores, a low gestational age and bacterial vaginosis in the child's mother during pregnancy. The most important etiologic organisms were Gram-positive cocci (39.7% of all the infections, 47.8% in EOS), Streptococcus agalactiae (20% of the EOS), Gram-negative bacilli (33.3% isolates), yeast-like fungi (isolated in 7.9% of cases) and atypical bacteria (22% of the cases of EO-pneumonia).The observed frequency of EOS did not differ from the one described in the literature, whereas the frequency of EO-pneumonia was higher. The bacterial etiologies suggest the vertical transmission of the pathogens and a close relationship between the observed EOIs with maternal environment. The applied perinatal antibiotic prophylaxis was ineffective."
0,Fluconazole prophylaxis is associated with a decreased rate of coagulase-negative Staphylococcal infections in a subset of extremely low birth weight neonates.,"Fluconazole prophylaxis is being used efficaciously in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for fungal prophylaxis in very low birth weight and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates. Little is known about the effect of fluconazole prophylaxis on bacterial infections. The purpose of this study was to examine that issue in a subset of ELBW, those weighing ???900 g at birth. This is a retrospective study conducted in a level III NICU at state-designated children hospital in New Jersey (USA). We examined the data from our records of neonates ??? 900 g birth weight during the period March 1, 2007-February 28, 2011. Inclusion in the study was all infants ??? 900 g before (n = 67) and after (n = 81) the institution of fluconazole prophylaxis. Fluconazole prophylaxis was accompanied by a significant decrease in both the rate and number of days of bacterial infections as well as co-infections. We found that the incidence of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CONS) decreased from 46.2 to 24.7 % (OR 2.63; 95 % CI 1.31-5.27). Similarly, days of infection also decreased significantly (p < 0.0001). These data suggest that fluconazole prophylaxis may be associated with a reduction in CONS infections in that subset of ELBW neonates."
0,[Antimicrobial and antimycotic therapy of intra-abdominal infections].,"Antimicrobial chemotherapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections (IAI). The initiation of initial antibiotic therapy must immediately follow the diagnosis of IAI. Selection of the antimicrobial agent is based on the expected pathogenic bacterial spectrum as a calculated empirical therapy. It is impossible to give general recommendations concerning the selection of a certain class of antimicrobial chemotherapeutics, since all available clinical trials were designed to prove noninferiority to the comparator product. Nevertheless several societies developed guidelines and recommendations based on the multitude of clinical trials investigating antimicrobial chemotherapeutics. The antibiotic therapy of postoperative peritonitis has to be implemented according to the patient's risk profile (antibiotic pretreatment, multiresistant pathogens, hospital epidemiology). The development of invasive peritoneal mycoses is rare. The therapy should be guided by the results of the microbiological work-up of the intraperitoneal cultures."
0,"Removal of waterborne pathogens from liver transplant unit water taps in prevention of healthcare-associated infections: a proposal for a cost-effective, proactive infection control strategy.","Hospital water supplies often contain waterborne pathogens, which can become a reservoir for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). We surveyed the extent of waterborne pathogen contamination in the water supply of a Liver Transplant Unit. The efficacy of point-of-use (POU) water filters was evaluated by comparative analysis in routine clinical use. Our baseline environmental surveillance showed that Legionella spp. (28%, 38/136), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%, 11/136), Mycobacterium spp. (87%, 118/136) and filamentous fungi (50%, 68/136) were isolated from the tap water of the Liver Transplant Unit. 28.9% of Legionella spp.-positive water samples (n = 38) showed high-level Legionella contamination (???10(3) CFU/L). After installation of the POU water filter, none of these pathogens were found in the POU filtered water samples. Furthermore, colonizations/infections with Gram-negative bacteria determined from patient specimens were reduced by 47% during this period, even if only 27% (3/11) of the distal sites were installed with POU water filters. In conclusion, the presence of waterborne pathogens was common in the water supply of our Liver Transplant Unit. POU water filters effectively eradicated these pathogens from the water supply. Concomitantly, healthcare-associated colonization/infections declined after the POU filters were installed, indicating their potential benefit in reducing waterborne HAIs."
0,Addition of aerosolized deoxycholate amphotericin B to systemic prophylaxis to prevent airways invasive fungal infections in allogeneic hematopoietic SCT: a single-center retrospective study.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) still pose major challenges in allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT), and effective antifungal prophylaxis remains a matter of debate. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the toxicity and the impact of aerosolized deoxycholate amphotericin B (aero-d-AmB) on respiratory tract IFIs (airways IFIs) in a homogeneous cohort of allogeneic HSCT patients, transplanted at one institution. Since 1999, 102 consecutive patients were transplanted from matched related (N = 71) or unrelated donor (MUD). Aero-d-AmB was administered for a median time of 16 days (range 2-45), in addition to systemic antifungal prophylaxis. Prolonged administration was neither associated with increased severe bacterial infections, nor with severe adverse events. In 16 patients in whom aero-d-AmB was delivered for less than 8 days, due to worsened clinical conditions or poor compliance, proven or probable airways IFIs were diagnosed in three cases (one mucormycosis and one fusariosis and one probable aspergillosis), whereas in 84 patients receiving aero-d-AmB for ??? 8 days, one possible and one probable aspergillosis were diagnosed. A shortened administration (< 8 days) of aero-d-AmB was therefore associated with an increased risk of both total airways IFIs (P = 0.027) and proven/probable IFIs (P = 0.012). At multivariate analysis prolonged aero-d-AmB administration retained an independent protective effect on airways IFIs (P = 0.026) whereas a MUD transplant was associated with a borderline increase of IFIs risk (P=0.052). Overall, 95.1% of patients did not experience airways IFIs and no patient died due to IFIs. In this cohort of patients, prolonged aero-d-AmB seems to have a role in preventing respiratory tract IFIs, but a randomized controlled trial is recommended to verify the impact of this prophylaxis in the setting of allogeneic HSCT."
0,Improving early diagnosis of pulmonary infections in patients with febrile neutropenia using low-dose chest computed tomography.,"We performed a prospective study in patients with chemotherapy induced febrile neutropenia to investigate the diagnostic value of low-dose computed tomography compared to standard chest radiography. The aim was to compare both modalities for detection of pulmonary infections and to explore performance of low-dose computed tomography for early detection of invasive fungal disease. The low-dose computed tomography remained blinded during the study. A consensus diagnosis of the fever episode made by an expert panel was used as reference standard. We included 67 consecutive patients on the first day of febrile neutropenia. According to the consensus diagnosis 11 patients (16.4%) had pulmonary infections. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 36%, 93%, 50% and 88% for radiography, and 73%, 91%, 62% and 94% for low-dose computed tomography, respectively. An uncorrected McNemar showed no statistical difference (p = 0.197). Mean radiation dose for low-dose computed tomography was 0.24 mSv. Four out of 5 included patients diagnosed with invasive fungal disease had radiographic abnormalities suspect for invasive fungal disease on the low-dose computed tomography scan made on day 1 of fever, compared to none of the chest radiographs. We conclude that chest radiography has little value in the initial assessment of febrile neutropenia on day 1 for detection of pulmonary abnormalities. Low-dose computed tomography improves detection of pulmonary infiltrates and seems capable of detecting invasive fungal disease at a very early stage with a low radiation dose."
0,Bacterial and fungal endophthalmitis in upper Egypt: related species and risk factors.,"To study risk factors, contributing factors of bacterial and fungal endophthalmitis in Upper Egypt, test the isolated species sensitive to some therapeutic agents, and to investigate the air-borne bacteria and fungi in opthalmology operating rooms.Thirty one cases of endophthalmitis were clinically diagnosed and microbiologically studied. Indoor air-borne bacteria and fungi inside four air-conditioned operating rooms in the Ophthalmology Department at Assiut University Hospitals were also investigated. The isolated microbes from endophthalmitis cases were tested for their ability to produce some extracellular enzymes including protease, lipase, urease, phosphatase and catalase. Also the ability of 5 fungal isolates from endophthalmitis origin to produce mycotoxins and their sensitivity to some therapeutic agents were studied.Results showed that bacteria and fungi were responsihle for infection in 10 and 6 cases of endophthalmitis, respectively and only 2 cases produced a mixture of bacteria and fungi. Trauma was the most prevalent risk factor of endophthalmitis where 58.1% of the 31 cases were due to trauma. In ophthalmology operating rooms, different bacterial and fungal species were isolated. 8 bacterial and 5 fungal isolates showed their ability to produce enzymes while only 3 fungal isolates were able to produce mycotoxins. Terbinafine showed the highest effect against most isolates in vitro.The ability of bacterial and fungal isolates to produce extracellular enzymes and mycotoxins may be aid in the invasion and destruction of eye tissues. Microbial contamination of operating rooms with air-borne bacteria and fungi in the present work may be a source of postoperative endophthalmitis."
0,Cytokine production assays reveal discriminatory immune defects in adults with recurrent infections and noninfectious inflammation.,"Cytokine production assays have been primarily used in research settings studying novel immunodeficiencies. We sought to determine the diagnostic value of cytokine production assays in patients with recurrent and/or severe infectious diseases (IDs) without known immunodeficiencies and unclassified noninfectious inflammatory disorders (NIIDs). We retrospectively examined cytokine production in whole-blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 157 adult patients. A cytokine production rate of <5% of that of healthy controls was considered defective. While monocyte-derived cytokine (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-??], interleukin-1?? [IL-1??], and IL-6) production was rarely affected, 30% of all included patients had deficient production of interferon gamma (IFN-??), IL-17A, or IL-22. Twenty-five percent of the NIID patients displayed defective IFN-?? production, whereas IL-17A production was generally unaffected. In the group of ID patients, defective IFN-?? production was found in 19% and 14% of the patients with viral and bacterial infections, respectively, and in 38%, 24%, and 50% of patients with mycobacterial, mucocutaneous, and invasive fungal infections, respectively. Defective IL-17A and IL-22 production was mainly confined to ID patients with mucocutaneous fungal infections. In conclusion, cytokine production assays frequently detect defective Th1 responses in patients with mycobacterial or fungal infections, in contrast to patients with respiratory tract infections or isolated bacterial infections. Defective IL-17A and IL-22 production was primarily found in patients with fungal infections, while monocyte-derived cytokine production was unaffected. Thus, lymphocyte-derived cytokine production assays are helpful in the diagnostic workup of patients with recurrent infections and suspected immunodeficiencies and have the potential to reveal immune defects that might guide adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy.

0,Central venous catheter infections and antibiotic therapy during long-term home parenteral nutrition: an 11-year follow-up study.,"Catheter-related bloodstream infections are a serious and common complication in patients receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN).Prevalence of infections, type of agents, and effectiveness of antibiotic therapy were evaluated in 296 patients (133 males, 163 females; mean age 58.2 +/- 13.5 years) receiving HPN for at least 3 months, from January 1995 to December 2006. Patients underwent 99,969 (331 +/- 552; minimum 91, maximum 4353) days of catheterization, corresponding to 93,236 (311 +/- 489; minimum 52, maximum 4353) days of HPN.Fifty-two patients (24 males and 28 females; 35 oncological and 17 nononcological) were diagnosed with 169 infections. The overall corresponding infection rate was 2.0 per 1000 days of catheterization, with a progressive, regular decrease with time. In 30 cases, immediate central venous catheter removal was necessary. Infections were eradicated in 103 of 139 (74%) cases. As to the most common causative agent, 86 (51%) infections were due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Of these, 64 were treated from 1995 to 2004, 57 of them (89%) successfully; 22 were treated from 2005 onward, only 7 of them (32%) successfully.Although the global infection rate has progressively decreased over the years, S epidermidis has shown an alarming increase in resistance to antibiotic treatment in the last 2 years, suggesting the need for strategies to prevent central venous catheter infection."
0,[Infections in cystic fibrosis: Up-to-date].,"This review focused on the news in CF airways infection. International guidelines were provided for the care of non tuberculous mycobacteria, and recent studies stressed on the benefit effect of azithromycin or combined antibiotics. The identification of multiresistant environmental bacteria in airways made to account for little-known consequences. Early diagnosis and eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus methi-R were still a concern, and reports were proposed. However, the studies on staphylococcus methi-R should be interpreted as regards the European or American continent. Thus, levofloxacine has demonstrated its efficacy without enhancing the efficiency. This drug will increase the choice for treating the patient, but no study were provided on the expected modification of the patient microbiota and the known risk of emergent resistance to antibiotics. Lastly, this review underlined that the CF practitioner was encouraged to search and not underestimate the presence of fungus, of which the not so well studied Aspergillus fumigatus."
0,Potential use of Bacillus thuringiensis bacteriocins to control antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy goats.,"Mastitis caused by microbial infections in dairy goats reduces milk yield, modifies milk composition, and potentially contributes to morbidity in herds and consumers of dairy products. Microorganisms associated with mastitis in dairy goats are commonly controlled with antibiotics, but it is known that continued use of these chemical agents promotes antibiotic resistance among bacterial populations. Recently, it has been shown that bacteriocins of Bacillus thuringiensis inhibit growth of food-borne pathogens and also bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. However, there is no report on their ability to inhibit microorganisms linked to mastitis in dairy goats. In this study, using 16S rDNA and ITS regions of rDNA, we identified nine bacterial isolates and an encapsulated yeast associated with mastitis in dairy goats. Enterococcus durans, Brevibacillus sp., and Staphylococcus epidermidis 2 were resistant to, respectively, 75, ~67, ~42, and ~42 % of the antibiotics screened. In addition, 60 % of the bacterial isolates were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, and dicloxacillin. Importantly, 60 % of the isolates were inhibited by the bacteriocins, but S. epidermidis 1, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia vulneris, and Cryptococcus neoformans were not susceptible to these antimicrobial peptides. Using Brevibacillus sp. and Staphylococcus chromogenes as indicator bacteria, we show that peptides of ~10 kDa that correspond to the molecular mass of bacteriocins used in this study are responsible for the inhibitory activity. Our results demonstrate that multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with subclinical mastitis in dairy goats from Guanajuato, Mexico, are susceptible to bacteriocins produced by B. thuringiensis."
0,Surveillance for infectious complications in pediatric acute liver failure - a prospective study.,"To prospectively evaluate infectious complications (IC) in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) by employing surveillance cultures.From 2011 to 2013, children with PALF in a tertiary care centre received a standard protocolised management. Prophylactic parenteral antibiotics were used without antifungals. Surveillance cultures of blood, urine, ascites and tracheal aspirates were sent. Biochemical and clinical parameters and outcomes were compared between children with and without IC.Of the 29 children with PALF admitted during the study period (median age 36 mo, range 12-90 mo), 13.8 % had blood stream infections (BSI) at admission. Organisms were isolated in 8.8 % (12/136) of the blood cultures, 13.7 % (11/80) of the urine cultures, 30.8 % (8/26) of the tracheal aspirates and 7.1 % (1/14) of the ascitic fluid cultures. Gram negative bacteriae (n?€?=?€?17) were the commonest, followed by fungi (n?€?=?€?13) and gram positive bacteriae (n?€?=?€?2). Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida nonalbicans group were the commonest bacteria and fungi respectively. After admission, fungal BSI and urinary tract infections were diagnosed at a median time of 4 d (range 3-8 d) and 3.5 d (range 3-6 d) respectively. ICs were not associated with other complications and increased mortality but with longer hospital and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay.In this study BSI was a common finding at admission in PALF. Inspite of prophylactic antibiotics, break through gram negative bacterial and fungal ICs were common. Empirical treatment of IC should include broad spectrum antibiotics. Fungal IC occurred beyond 48 h. Prophylactic antifungals at admission may be considered to decrease their frequency. IC prolongs PICU and hospital stay."
0,The clinical value of biomarkers in respiratory complications in hematopoietic SCT.,"To determine the role of biomarkers in the clinical management of respiratory complications (RC) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, we have prospectively evaluated a cohort of 175 patients followed-up for 1 year after HSCT. To avoid misinterpretation, we have excluded both unidentified respiratory infections (RI) and mixed RI. A total of 64 RC were included. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and proadrenomedullin (proADM) were measured at diagnosis and on day 3 and 7. Different cytokines were evaluated in serum on the first day. No HSCT recipients without RC were included as a control group. Compared with RI, non-infectious RC showed a significant increase in CRP, proADM and interleukin 6 on day 0 (P=0.005; P=0.03 and P=0.04, respectively). When only RI were considered, we observed that bacterial-fungal PI showed higher levels of CRP (P=0.02), PCT (P=0.04) and proADM (P<0.01). Persistent low levels of proADM biomarkers suggest viral infection (specificity and positive predictive value 100%). Patients dying of RC had PCT and proADM levels higher than survivors (P=0.002 and P=0.03, respectively). In HSCT recipients biomarkers increase in both infectious and non-infectious RC. They may have utility in the assessment of the severity of RC and in suspecting a viral etiology."
0,Microbiological diagnosis and antimicrobial sensitivity profiles in diseased free-living raptors.,"Free-living raptors (birds of prey) can act as reservoirs of potentially zoonotic agents, but they also can be affected by microorganisms as target hosts. In this retrospective study, microbiological results (n?€?=?€?663) and antibiotic sensitivity profiles (n?€?=?€?108) of bacterial isolates were analysed from diseased free-living raptors. Sixty-nine percent of cases (n?€?=?€?457) yielded bacteria: 58% were in pure culture and 42% were of different species. Remarkably, samples from necropsies (47%) had higher percentage of pure isolations than those obtained from clinical (31%) samples (P?€?<?€?0.001). Among bacterial isolates, Escherichia coli was the most common agent (35%), principally recovered from necropsied birds with clinical signs of septicaemia or respiratory disorders. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) was isolated from birds with systemic infection and from oral lesions, especially in nocturnal raptors (P?€?<?€?0.001). Staphylococcus spp. (5%), mainly Staphylococcus aureus, was found to be the most prevalent cause of pododermatitis (35%) and Staphylococcus hyicus was isolated from conjunctivitis (18.2%). Interestingly, 8% of samples with lesions compatible with avian tuberculosis were positive to the Mycobacterium avium complex. The most frequent fungi associated with pneumonic lesions and ingluvitis were Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp., respectively. More than 50% of the 108 isolates (34 different bacterial spp.) demonstrated resistance to clindamycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, cefuroxime, enrofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. Among the E. coli strains, 71% (27/38) presented a multidrug-resistance pattern to >3 antimicrobials. Detection in wildlife of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens that might be significant at the animal-human-ecosystem interface is of great relevance under the 'One Health' approach."
0,Parasites pitched against nature: Pitch Lake water protects guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from microbial and gyrodactylid infections.,"SUMMARY The enemy release hypothesis proposes that in parasite depleted habitats, populations will experience relaxed selection and become more susceptible (or less tolerant) to pathogenic infections. Here, we focus on a population of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) that are found in an extreme environment (the Pitch Lake, Trinidad) and examine whether this habitat represents a refuge from parasites. We investigated the efficacy of pitch in preventing microbial infections in Pitch Lake guppies, by exposing them to dechlorinated water, and reducing gyrodactylid infections on non-Pitch Lake guppies by transferring them to Pitch Lake water. We show that (i) natural prevalence of ectoparasites in the Pitch Lake is low compared to reference populations, (ii) Pitch Lake guppies transferred into aquarium water develop microbial infections, and (iii) experimentally infected guppies are cured of their gyrodactylid infections both by natural Pitch Lake water and by dechlorinated water containing solid pitch. These results indicate a role for Pitch Lake water in the defence of guppies from their parasites and suggest that Pitch Lake guppies might have undergone enemy release in this extreme environment. The Pitch Lake provides an ideal ecosystem for studies on immune gene evolution in the absence of parasites and long-term evolutionary implications of hydrocarbon pollution for vertebrates."
0,Severe fungal infections in intensive therapy.,"Identification of pathogens in severe fungal infections, by positive cultures, is usually difficult, delays appropriate therapy, and impairs treatment. Despite progress in biologic sciences, the diagnosis of candidiasis still poses a challenge. Early symptoms are not specific, and cultures are usually negative. Molecular methods are rarely used in clinical practice. Common empiric therapy of suspected fungal infection is based on examination, history, and analysis of risk factors. The aim of the study was to analyse fungal infections in ITU and to find factors which may help in their recognition.In this retrospective study, the medical histories of ITU patients were analysed. Patients were divided into two groups: I - suspected and II - confirmed, fungal infections. The factors considered were: age, gender, suspected source of fungal infection, co-existing bacterial infection, Candida Score, laboratory tests taken on the day of fungal infection diagnosis (leukocyte count, platelets, and CRP), duration of hospitalisation, declarations of infection from departments, and results of treatment.Statistically significant differences between the groups were found in Candida Scores, duration of hospitalisation and departments of infection. The Candida Scores were higher among those patients in whom infections were already suspected. In this group, the duration of hospitalization was shorter, and infections frequently developed during hospitalisation in the ITU.The analysis of infections and Candida Scores helped to initiate prompt antifungal therapy and to reduce the duration of hospitalisation. Infection markers that were routinely used in the ITU were not specific, did not allow identification of patients with fungal infection."
0,Effects of radix ginseng on microbial infections: a narrative review.,"To summarized the antimicrobial-like effects of Radix Ginseng, which provide important information to the relevant researchers and clinicians, and will benefit the clinical treatment of infectious diseases.PubMed and Google were used to search for and collect scientific publications related to Radix Ginseng and microbial infections. The authors read, classified, and discussed the associated scientific results or evidences, and summarized the corresponding results.In this review, recent studies on the beneficial effects of Radix Ginseng extracts on microbial and biofilm infections were reviewed. The importance and significance of Radix Ginseng's beneficial effects are discussed. Evidence for the favorable effects of Radix Ginseng extracts on viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections and the possible underlying mechanisms are summarized.Radix Ginseng might be a promising supplemental remedy for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases."
0,Imaging in infections of the head and neck.,"Infections of the head and neck vary in their clinical course and outcome because of the diversity of organs and anatomic compartments involved. Imaging plays a central role in delineating the anatomic extent of the disease process, identifying the infection source, and detecting complications. The utility of imaging to differentiate between a solid phlegmonous mass and an abscess cannot be overemphasized. This review briefly describes and pictorially illustrates the typical imaging findings of some important head and neck infections, such as malignant otitis externa, otomastoiditis bacterial and fungal sinusitis, orbital cellulitis, sialadenitis, cervical lymphadenitis, and deep neck space infections."
0,Vascular graft infections in the intensive care unit: clinical spectrum and prognostic factors.,"To report clinical characteristics and prognosis of vascular graft infections in Intensive Care Unit (ICU).Thirty seven patients consecutively admitted in ICU for suspected or definite vascular graft infection between January 2006 and June 2009 were included.Staphylococcus species (n??=??18) and enterobacteriae (n??=??16) were the most frequent causative organisms. Twenty six patients (70%) needed mechanical ventilation. Further surgical procedures were performed in 7 patients (19%). In case of definite infection, mortality in ICU was 33%. In non survivors, shock (92% vs 42%, p??=??0.01), age??>??70??years (73% vs 27%, p??=??0.04), POSSUM score??>??45 (73% vs 27%, p??=??0.04) and extra-anatomic bypass (45% vs 14%, p??=??0.05) were more frequent, intra-operative volume of red cells transfusion (6??????3 vs 3??????2 units, p??=??0.006) and of fresh frozen plasma (2.8??????2.8 vs 0.7??????1.2 units, p??=??0.02), and SAPS II score (58??????26 vs 38??????17, p??=??0.03) were higher. Proportion of adequate initial antibiotic therapy was similar in survivors and non survivors (91% vs 100%, p??=??0.4). Proportion of patients treated with an aminoglycoside tended to be higher in survivors (59% vs 27%, p??=??0.07). By multivariate analysis, only shock was associated with death in ICU (AOR: 16.3; 95% CI: 1.7-152.1; p??=??0.01).Vascular graft infection carries high morbidity and mortality rates in ICU. Extra-anatomic bypass might be associated with higher mortality. Early aminoglycoside prescription might be protective."
0,"Clinical features, microbiology and surgical outcomes of infective endocarditis: a 13-year study from a UK tertiary cardiothoracic referral centre.","Infective endocarditis (IE) causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Patient and pathogen profiles, as well as microbiological and operative strategies, continue to evolve. The impact of these changes requires evaluation to inform optimum management and identify individuals at high risk of early mortality.Identification of clinical and microbiological features, and surgical outcomes, among patients presenting to a UK tertiary cardiothoracic centre for surgical management of IE between 1998 and 2010.Retrospective observational cohort study.Clinical, biochemical, microbiological and echocardiographic data were identified from clinical records. Principal outcomes were all-cause 28-day mortality and duration of post-operative admission.Patients (n = 336) were predominantly male (75.0%); median age 52 years (IQR = 41-67). Most cases involved the aortic (56.0%) or mitral (53.9%) valves. Microbiological diagnoses, obtained in 288 (85.7%) patients, included streptococci (45.2%); staphylococci (34.5%); Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella (HACEK) organisms (3.0%); and fungi (1.8%); 11.3% had polymicrobial infection. Valve replacement in 308 (91.7%) patients included mechanical prostheses (69.8%), xenografts (24.0%) and homografts (6.2%). Early mortality was 12.2%, but fell progressively during the study (P = 0.02), as did median duration of post-operative admission (33.5 to 10.5 days; P = 0.0003). Multivariable analysis showed previous cardiothoracic surgery (OR = 3.85, P = 0.03), neutrophil count (OR = 2.27, P = 0.05), albumin (OR = 0.94, P = 0.04) and urea (OR = 2.63, P < 0.001) predicted early mortality.This study demonstrates reduced post-operative early mortality and duration of hospital admission for IE patients over the past 13 years. Biomarkers (previous cardiothoracic surgery, neutrophil count, albumin and urea), predictive of early post-operative mortality, require prospective evaluation to refine algorithms, further improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs associated with IE."
0,Trauma-related infections due to cluster munitions.,"Trauma-related infections remain a concerning and potentially avoidable complication of conflict-related injuries. During the Israeli conflict in South Lebanon, more than four million sub-munitions were dropped over South Lebanese soil. In this study, we will explore the different types of infection caused by sub-munitions and penetrating agents. This prospective study took place from 2006 to 2012 at the Lebanese University within the Faculty of Medical Sciences' departments. This study sample consisted of 350 injured casualties. Patients suffered from blast injuries with fragmentations targeting the head, face, torso, abdomen, pelvis and extremities. Of the 350 causalities studied, 326 (93.1%) were males, and 24 (6.9%) were females. Ages varied between 10 and 70 years, with the average age being 27 years. Of the 350 patients studied, 68 (19.4%) developed infections. Infections varied between pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, Candida and fungus and sometimes led to necrosis. Vaccinations, antibiotic therapies and proper wound irrigation must be performed at appropriate emergency units. Excision and complete debridement of necrotic and contaminated tissue should also be performed. The Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008 should be adhered to, as these weapons indiscriminately and disproportionately harm civilians, thereby violating the well-established international principles governing conflict.

0,High Infection-Related Mortality in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia without Preventive Antibiotics and Antifungals: Retrospective Cohort Study of a Single Center from a Middle-Income Country.,"This study aimed to evaluate infection-related mortality in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated without preventive antibiotics and antifungals in a middle-income country.Infection-related mortality was evaluated retrospectively in 49 pediatric patients.A total of 173 chemotherapy courses were administered as first-line chemotherapy. Four patients died during induction: one patient due to intracranial bleeding, two patients due to typhlitis, and one patient due to invasive fungal infection with pulmonary vascular invasion and massive bleeding. Another two patients died with resistant disease. During consolidation there were four infection-related deaths and one death due to cardiotoxicity. In first-line chemotherapy mortality was 22% (11/49); infection-related mortality was 14% (7/49). Event-free survival and overall survival at 6 years were 42.9% and 61.2% (95% CI: 44-76 and 66-99 months), respectively.Due to considerable infection-related deaths, antibacterial and mold-active antifungal prophylaxis may be tried during neutropenic periods in pediatric AML."
0,The effect of statin therapy on the incidence of infections: a retrospective cohort analysis.,"Statins have been postulated to prevent infection through immunomodulatory effects.To compare the incidence of infections in statin users to that in nonusers within the same health care system.This was a retrospective cohort study of patients enrolled as Tricare Prime or Plus in the San Antonio military multimarket. Statin users were patients who received a statin for at least 3 months between October 1, 2004 and September 30, 2005. Nonusers were patients who did not receive a statin within the study period (October 1, 2003-September 30, 2009). Inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes were used to determine the incidence of infections during the follow-up period (October 1, 2005-September 30, 2009) via multivariable regression analysis and time to infection via Cox regression analysis.Of 45,247 patients who met the study criteria, 12,981 (29%) were statin users and 32,266 were nonusers. After adjustments for age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Score, tobacco use, alcohol abuse/dependence, health care utilization and use of specific medication classes, statin use was associated with an increased incidence of common infections (odds ratio [OR]: 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.19) but not influenza or fungal infections (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.80-1.39; OR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.91-1.04, respectively). Time-to-first infection was similar in statin users and nonusers in all infection categories examined.Statin use was associated with an increased incidence of common infections but not influenza or fungal infections. This study does not support a protective role of statins in infection prevention; however, the influence of potential confounders cannot be excluded."
0,[Management of microbial infections in myeloid leukemia].,"The management of microbial infection is one of the important issues for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). They are considered to be at high risk for infection. They should be provided appropriate antimicrobial agents recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Recently, there have been several significant changes in IDSA guidelines especially in the treatment of invasive fungal infection because of developments in several antifungal agents. This document constitutes the recommendations for the management of infection in patients with AML according to the updated guidelines of the IDSA. Evidence about infection control in AML is not enough in contrast to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Further studies are necessary to establish the strategy for microbial infections in AML."
0,Molecular methods for detection of invasive fungal infections and mycobacteria and their clinical significance in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Infection remains an important source of morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the immune reconstitution period after transplantation, HSCT recipients are most likely to have bacterial or fungal infections. Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) and mycobacterial infections (MBIs) are among the complications of HSCT, with high morbidity and mortality rates. Early diagnosis of both is crucial in order to manipulate the disease and to avoid fulminant outcomes. This chapter reviews the current knowledge on the molecular diagnosis of IFIs and MBIs in HSCT recipients, describing two different polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, one commercial (qPCR, Roche) and one in-house IS6110-based protocol."
0,Epidemiology of infections acquired in intensive care units.,"Infections acquired in the intensive care unit (ICU) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Using surveillance data collected in the United States and internationally, we describe contemporary rates, sites, and pathogens responsible for common ICU-acquired infections. Emerging pathogens are outlined, including a systematic review of published ICU infection outbreaks from 2005 to 2010. Compared with a similar review of outbreaks conducted in 2003, multiresistant gram-negative bacteria (eg, ACINETOBACTER and PSEUDOMONAS species) were more commonly reported, whereas resistant STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS was reported less frequently. Advances in ICU infection prevention, including central line bundles, chlorhexidine body wash, and hand hygiene interventions occurred during this period. We also describe how changes in the pattern of antimicrobial use can affect the prevalence of multiresistant pathogens."
0,Mycobacterial disease in patients with chronic granulomatous disease: A??retrospective analysis of 71 cases.,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare primary immunodeficiency caused by inborn errors of the phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase complex. From the first year of life onward, most affected patients display multiple, severe, and recurrent infections caused by bacteria and fungi. Mycobacterial infections have also been reported in some patients.Our objective was to assess the effect of mycobacterial disease in patients with CGD.We analyzed retrospectively the clinical features of mycobacterial disease in 71 patients with CGD. Tuberculosis and BCG disease were diagnosed on the basis of microbiological, pathological, and/or clinical criteria.Thirty-one (44%) patients had tuberculosis, and 53 (75%) presented with adverse effects of BCG vaccination; 13 (18%) had both tuberculosis and BCG infections. None of these patients displayed clinical disease caused by environmental mycobacteria, Mycobacterium leprae, or Mycobacterium ulcerans. Most patients (76%) also had other pyogenic and fungal infections, but 24% presented solely with mycobacterial disease. Most patients presented a single localized episode of mycobacterial disease (37%), but recurrence (18%), disseminated disease (27%), and even death (18%) were also observed. One common feature in these patients was an early age at presentation for BCG disease. Mycobacterial disease was the first clinical manifestation of CGD in 60% of these patients.Mycobacterial disease is relatively common in patients with CGD living in countries in which tuberculosis is endemic, BCG vaccine is mandatory, or both. Adverse reactions to BCG and severe forms of tuberculosis should lead to a suspicion of CGD. BCG vaccine is contraindicated in patients with CGD."
0,Audit of peripheral stem cell transplantation for aplastic anemia in multitransfused infected patients.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a curative modality for aplastic anemia; the preferred stem cell source is bone marrow. However, allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) used in high-risk patients is associated with higher risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Our center receives multitransfused, alloimmunized, infected, late referrals for transplant.Forty-one patients of median age 22 years (range 8-37) received allogeneic-PBSCT from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors. The median time since diagnosis was 12 months (range 4-65) and median pretransplant transfusions were 37 (range 6-160). Six patients were platelet refractory and one alloimmunized for pan-red blood cell (RBC) antigens. Several patients had pretransplant icterus or renal dysfunction and 26 (63.4%) had unresponsive bacterial/fungal infections. Our conditioning regimen included fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) for 6 days (days -10 to -5), cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d for 2 days (days -6 to -5), and antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM) 30 mg/kg/d for 4 days (day -4 to -1), which was reduced to 2 days in 2 patients. We used standard GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine and methotrexate on days 1, 3, 6, 11.The median follow-up period was 29 months (range 6-78) and median engraftment time 10 days (range 8-17). Thirty-one patients (75.6%) were treated for infections, with 20 of these on antifungals for preexisting infections. There were two graft rejections and 10 (24.4%) deaths, with three intracranial hemorrhages, two rejections with infection, three cases of refractory GVHD (acute/overlap syndrome) with cytomegalovirus reactivation, and two invasive fungal infections. Overall incidence of acute GVHD was 39% with 2 grade IV cases. Ten (25%) cases developed chronic GVHD, with extensive GVHD in four.With more experience using shortened course of ATGAM, HLA-matched donor transfusions, and availability of newer antifungals, we have been able to decrease PBSCT-related mortality. Further improvement will be possible with early referrals."
0,(1???3)-??-D-glucan aptamers labeled with technetium-99m: Biodistribution and imaging in experimental models of bacterial and fungal infection.,"Acid nucleic aptamers are RNA or DNA oligonucleotides capable of binding to a target molecule with high affinity and selectivity. These molecules are promising tools in nuclear medicine. Many aptamers have been used as targeting molecule of radiopharmaceuticals in preclinical studies. (1???3)-??-D-glucans are the main structural cell wall components of fungi and some bacteria. In the present study two radiolabeled (1???3)-??-D-glucan aptamers (seq6 and seq30) were evaluated to identity infectious foci caused by fungal or bacterial cells.Aptamer labeling with <sup>99m</sup>Tc was performed by the direct method and biodistribution studies were accomplished in Swiss mice (n=6) infected in the right thigh muscle with Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans. A <sup>99m</sup>Tc radiolabeled library consisting of oligonucleotides with random sequences was used as control.There was a higher uptake of <sup>99m</sup>Tc radiolabeled aptamers in the infected thigh than in the left thigh muscle (non-infected) in the S. aureus infected animals. The target/non-target ratios were 3.17??0.22 for seq6 and 2.66??0.10 for seq30. These ratios were statistically higher than the value (1.54??0.05) found for the radiolabeled library (control). With regard to biodistribution, no statistical difference was verified between aptamers and control uptakes in the infection foci in the C. albicans infected animals. The target/non-target ratios were 1.53??0.03, 1.64??0.12 and 1.08??0.02 for radiolabeled library, seq6 and seq30, respectively. Scintigraphic imaging of infected foci using radiolabeled aptamers was possible only for S. aureus infected mice.Seq6 and seq30 aptamers proved to be inefficient for diagnosis of C. albicans infection. Nevertheless, their applicability for diagnosis of S. aureus and other bacterial infections by scintigraphy should be further explored."
0,Central nervous system device infections.,"Infections of central nervous system (CNS) devices are relatively common and potentially severe. The most common devices associated with infection are ventriculostomy catheters, shunts, and deep brain stimulators. The prevention, diagnosis, and management of these infections require a collaborative approach because of the complexity of surgery, the nuances of antimicrobial delivery in the CNS, and the potential for severe morbidity and mortality. This article focuses on new developments in the management and prevention of intracranial device infections, in particular ventriculostomy-related infections and infections of deep brain stimulators."
0,Usefulness of real-time PCR for the diagnosis of sepsis in ICU-acquired infections.,"Real-time PCR methods are able to rapidly detect a wide panel of microorganisms. These methods are of interest in critically ill patients to determine the presence of bacteria in the blood and other biological samples, especially in those patients with prior antimicrobial treatment. In intensive care unit (ICU), the LightCycler SeptiFast (LC-SF) Test provides 1.5 to 2 fold higher positivity rate compared with conventional blood cultures. Although identification of the bacterium by LC-SF is rapid and sensitive, susceptibility test could not be performed using this technique, except the methicillin- resistance for Staphylococci. The conventional cultures remain necessary for samples in ICU because of the high incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the need for antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterium to treat the patient correctly. A negative result for a Gram positive or negative bacterium allows deescalating the initial antimicrobial treatment, and decreasing the pressure of selection. Moreover, it is necessary to understand and interpret a DNA signal knowing that a dead bacterial material may be detected in a patient without any infection. What is the clinical relevance of bacterial DNA present in the blood and does the DNAemia found reflect true infection? Cost-effectiveness of the real-time PCR should be determined. Meanwhile, this test should be restricted to severe clinical situations, especially ICU patients with severe sepsis. In the future, real-time PCR tests should include more pathogens and antimicrobial resistant targets."
0,[Treatment and prevention of infections in cancer patients with neutropenia].,"Prognosis of malignant diseases is significantly influenced by infectious morbidity and mortality. Thus, up to date management of cancer patients, in addition to other supportive care modalities, should also incorporate diagnostic methods and therapy of infections. In order to improve outcome, patients developing febrile neutropenia following antitumour treatment should be adequately informed regarding the risk of infections. At the same time, centres responsible for cancer patient care should set up written protocols for basic workup and empirical antibiotic therapy. Here general characteristics of neutropenic infections developing in solid tumour patients are outlined and key points for risk assessment are highlighted. In addition, options and limits of anti-infective therapy as well as prophylaxis of infections are reviewed. Importance of a fully functional institutional infection control system and multidisciplinary patient management is also emphasised."
0,Practical use of povidone-iodine antiseptic in the maintenance of oral health and in the prevention and treatment of common oropharyngeal infections.,"To better inform medical practitioners on the role of antiseptics in oropharyngeal health and disease, this article focuses on povidone-iodine (PVP-I), an established and widely-available antiseptic agent.Review of the anti-infective profile, efficacy and safety of PVP-I in managing common upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, influenza and tonsillo-pharyngitis, as well as oral complications resulting from cancer treatment (oral mucositis), and dental conditions (periodontitis, caries).Antiseptics with broad-spectrum anti-infective activity and low resistance potential offer an attractive option in both infection control and prevention. While there is some evidence of benefit of antiseptics in a variety of clinical settings that include dental and oral hygiene, dermatology, oncology, and pulmonology, there appears to be discordance between the evidence-base and practice. This is especially apparent in the management and prevention of oropharyngeal infections, for which the use of antiseptics varies considerably between clinical practices, and is in marked contrast to their dermal application, where they are extensively used as both a prophylaxis and a treatment of skin and wound infections, thus minimising the use of antibiotics.The link between oral and oropharyngeal health status and susceptibility to infection has long been recognised. The high rates of antibiotic misuse and subsequent development of bacterial resistance (e.g. increasing vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) in large parts of the world, especially across Asia Pacific, highlight the need for identifying alternative antimicrobials that would minimise the use of these medications. This, together with recent large-scale outbreaks of, for example, avian and swine influenza virus, further underline the importance of an increasing armamentarium for infection prevention and control."
0,Infections in children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease treated with tumor necrosis factor-?? inhibitors: systematic review of the literature.,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-??) inhibitors are increasingly administered to children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (pIBD). Adult studies indicate that TNF-?? inhibitors lead to an increased risk of serious infections compared to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. We report herein a systematic literature review detailing the epidemiology and types of infections reported in children with JIA and pIBD treated with TNF-?? inhibitors. The most frequently reported infections were mild and characterized as viral in etiology. Severe bacterial and fungal infections also occurred, but were less common and possibly associated with intrinsic risk factors and concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Few pediatric patients developed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, likely due to effective screening. There were 8 infectious fatalities in children treated with TNF-?? inhibitors. Overall, although rare, serious infections occur in immunocompromised children and adolescents with JIA and pIBD receiving TNF-?? inhibitors. "
0,"Italian guidelines for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of invasive fungal infections in solid organ transplant recipients.","Use of various induction regimens, of novel immunosuppressive agents, and of newer prophylactic strategies continues to change the pattern of infections among solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Although invasive fungal infections (IFIs) occur at a lower incidence than bacterial and viral infections in this population, they remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In March 2008, a panel of Italian experts on fungal infections and organ transplantation convened in Castel Gandolfo (Rome) to develop consensus guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of IFIs among SOT recipients. We discussed the definitions, microbiological and radiological diagnoses, prophylaxis, empirical treatment, and therapy of established disease. Throughout the consensus document, recommendations as clinical guidelines were rated according to the standard scoring system of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the United Stated Public Health Service."
0,Comparison of micafungin and voriconazole in the treatment of invasive fungal infections in kidney transplant recipients.,"Invasive fungal infections are a major threat to renal transplant recipients. Micafungin and voriconazole are two useful antifungal agents for treating such infections. Our objective is to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of micafungin and voriconazole in the initial treatment of such infections.In this prospective, multicentre, open-labelled, randomized, controlled trial, renal transplant recipients with invasive fungal infections were assigned to receive either micafungin or voriconazole. The enrolled subjects received a kidney transplant between March 2008 and March 2010 at one of the two transplant centres in Henan Province, China. The efficacy and adverse effects of the two treatments were compared.The clinical trial enrolled 65 patients, of whom 31 were treated with micafungin, and 34 with voriconazole. The rates of microbiological evidence of infection in the micafungin and voriconazole groups were 64.5% and 70.5%, respectively, whereas the rates of Candida as the major cultured fungus were 80.0% and 75.0%, respectively. Complicated bacterial infection rates in the two treatment groups were 38.7% and 32.4%, respectively, whereas complicated CMV viral infection occurred at a rate of 19.2% and 23.5%, respectively. Fungal infection within one to 3 months after transplant was 83.6% (26/31) and 85.3% (29/34) in the micafungin and voriconazole groups, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of efficacy, survival beyond 10 days and discontinuation of treatment because of lack of efficacy (P > 0.05). Mortality rates in the micafungin and voriconazole groups were 9.7% (3/31) and 12.1% (4/33), respectively. Rates of adverse effects in the two groups were 41.9% and 51.6% (P > 0.05), respectively.This is the first comparison of micafungin and voriconazole in renal transplant patients. Our study shows that the effectiveness of micafungin was similar to that of voriconazole in such patients."
0,Infections in Children on Biologics.,"Biologics target various pathways to modify immunologic activity. Biologic use to treat pediatric patients continues to expand; but limited data exist regarding infectious complications of these agents, especially for newer agents. Infectious events reported in the literature for pediatric patients indicate that a variety of bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, and fungal infections can occur. Further pediatric-specific reports are needed to fill knowledge gaps in the complications related to these agents."
0,"The changing profile of infant mortality from bacterial, viral and fungal infection over two decades.","Infection is an important cause of neonatal and infant mortality. We evaluated changes in infant deaths from infections from 1988 to 2008 in the North of England.We interrogated a population-based survey and reviewed infant deaths from infection. Proportional contribution to deaths, pathogens identified and risk factors were analysed.Thirteen percentage of 4366 infant deaths from a population of 704 536 livebirths were infectious. The absolute numbers of infant deaths from infection fell over time but the proportion of deaths from infection increased (12.1%, 13.6% and 14.9%). Significantly preterm infants were increasingly represented in successive epochs (14%, 24% and 38%). Infant mortality rate (IMR) from meningococcus and Group B Streptococcus (GBS) fell in the latest epoch, but there was a corresponding increase from Escherichia coli and candida.This large study shows that infections have become proportionately more important causes of death especially in very preterm infants. Recent significant reductions in death from meningococcus and GBS are likely to represent successful achievements of vaccination and antibiotic prophylactic policies. Increases in IMR from E. coli may relate to GBS prophylaxis and increases in candida to the increase from preterm populations. Further efforts to understand these changing patterns and develop additional prevention and treatment strategies and vaccines remain an urgent priority."
0,Compounding to Prevent and Treat Dysbiosis of the Human Vaginal Microbiome.,"Homeostasis of the human vaginal microbiome, which consists of the bacteriome (colonizing bacteria) and the mycobiome (resident fungi), is essential to the health of the female reproductive system. Dysbiosis of either microbial community can be caused by a variety of factors ranging from behavioral issues (personal-hygiene practices, the choice of contraceptives, smoking, etc.) to biological variables (the host-microbiome composition, menstruation, the robustness of the host's immune response). Clinicians often consult compounding pharmacistsbabout the formulation and use of customized preparations to treat vaginal diseases and re-establish a healthful vaginal microenvironment when commercially manufactured products have failed or are unavailable. In this article, the function of the human vaginal bacteriome and mycobiome are examined, a common microorganism identified in each of those microenvironments is discussed, factors that cause dysbiosis are reviewed, and the role of biofilm in the vaginal microbiota is explored. A question typical of those asked by prescribers committed to improving women's health and decreasing the incidence of recurring bacterial vaginosis or fungal infections is answered. Formulations for compounds that help ensure or reestablish the homeostasis of the human vaginal bacteriome and mycobiome are also provided."
2,Pattern of bacterial and fungal infections in the first 3 months after pediatric living donor liver transplantation: an 11-year single-center experience.,"Infection after pediatric living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Here, we sought to determine the incidence, timing, location, and risk factors for bacterial and fungal infections. We retrospectively investigated infection for 3 postoperative months in 345 consecutive pediatric patients (56.2% were females) who underwent primary LDLT at Kyoto University Hospital, Japan. A total of 179 patients (51.9%) developed at least 1 bacterial and/or fungal infection episode, with an infection rate of 2.5 per patient. The predominant infection site was the surgical site (52%). Most of the bacterial and fungal infection occurred within the first month. Enterococcus species followed by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant bacterial pathogens. All fungal isolates were Candida species. Prolonged preoperative hospital stay more than 7 days (P = 0.025) and bile leak (P = 0.047) were independent predictors of bacterial infection. Preoperative ascites (P = 0.009) and prolonged insertion of intravascular catheters (P = 0.001) independently predicted fungal infections. Bacterial and fungal infections were responsible for 42.9% of the causes of death in our study. To avoid bacterial and fungal infections after LDLT, broader-spectrum prophylaxis to cover the range of organisms seen in these infections should be considered as a more favorable treatment regimen to prevent prophylaxis failure, especially for patients with a preoperative hospital stay more than 7 days or operative complications in the form of a bile leak. Early drain removal and prophylactic antifungal drugs should be considered for patients with preoperative ascites. Cooperation between attending physicians and infectious disease physicians can improve the outcome of patients after LDLT."
2,Transferrin-mediated iron sequestration as a novel therapy for bacterial and fungal infections.,"Pathogenic microbes must acquire essential nutrients, including iron, from the host in order to proliferate and cause infections. Iron sequestration is an ancient host antimicrobial strategy. Thus, enhancing iron sequestration is a promising, novel anti-infective strategy. Unfortunately, small molecule iron chelators have proven difficult to develop as anti-infective treatments, in part due to unacceptable toxicities. Iron sequestration in mammals is predominantly mediated by the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins. In this review, we explore the possibility of administering supraphysiological levels of exogenous transferrin as an iron sequestering therapy for infections, which could overcome some of the problems associated with small molecule chelation. Recent studies suggest that transferrin delivery may represent a promising approach to augment both natural resistance and traditional antibiotic therapy. "
2,Severe infections in critically ill solid organ transplant recipients.,"Severe infections are among the most common causes of death in immunocompromised patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of these infections has evolved in the last decade.We aim to provide a comprehensive review of these severe infections in this population.Review of the literature pertaining to severe infections in critically ill solid organ transplant recipients. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for documents published since database inception until November 2017.The epidemiology of severe infections has changed in the immunocompromised patients. This population is presenting to the intensive care unit with specific transplantation procedure-related infections, device-associated infections, a multitude of opportunistic viral infections, an increasing number of nosocomial infections and bacterial diseases with a more limited therapeutic armamentarium. Both molecular diagnostics and imaging techniques have had substantial progress in the last decade, which will, we hope, translate into faster and more precise diagnoses, as well as more optimal empirical treatment de-escalation.The key clinical elements to improve the outcome of critically ill solid organ transplant recipients depend on the knowledge of geographic epidemiology, specific surgical procedures, net state of immunosuppression, hospital microbial ecology, aggressive diagnostic strategy and search for source control, rapid initiation of antimicrobials and minimization of iatrogenic immunosuppression."
2,Sirtuin 3 deficiency does not alter host defenses against bacterial and fungal infections.,"Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is the main mitochondrial deacetylase. SIRT3 regulates cell metabolism and redox homeostasis, and protects from aging and age-associated pathologies. SIRT3 may drive both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects. SIRT3 deficiency has been reported to promote chronic inflammation-related disorders, but whether SIRT3 impacts on innate immune responses and host defenses against infections remains essentially unknown. This aspect is of primary importance considering the great interest in developing SIRT3-targeted therapies. Using SIRT3 knockout mice, we show that SIRT3 deficiency does not affect immune cell development and microbial ligand-induced proliferation and cytokine production by splenocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Going well along with these observations, SIRT3 deficiency has no major impact on cytokine production, bacterial burden and survival of mice subjected to endotoxemia, Escherichia coli peritonitis, Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, listeriosis and candidiasis of diverse severity. These data suggest that SIRT3 is not critical to fight infections and support the safety of SIRT3-directed therapies based on SIRT3 activators or inhibitors for treating metabolic, oncologic and neurodegenerative diseases without putting patients at risk of infection."
2,Emerging novel and antimicrobial-resistant respiratory tract infections: new drug development and therapeutic options.,"The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens for which diminishing treatment options are available is of major global concern. New viral respiratory tract infections with epidemic potential, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, swine-origin influenza A H1N1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, require development of new antiviral agents. The substantial rise in the global numbers of patients with respiratory tract infections caused by pan-antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and multiazole-resistant fungi has focused attention on investments into development of new drugs and treatment regimens. Successful treatment outcomes for patients with respiratory tract infections across all health-care settings will necessitate rapid, precise diagnosis and more effective and pathogen-specific therapies. This Series paper describes the development and use of new antimicrobial agents and immune-based and host-directed therapies for a range of conventional and emerging viral, bacterial, and fungal causes of respiratory tract infections.
